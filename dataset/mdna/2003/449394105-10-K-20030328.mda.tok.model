item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations except for the historical information contained herein  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed here 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  without limitation  those discussed below and in the section entitled risk factors 
since  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to the discovery and development of potential therapeutic and prophylactic products 
to date  we have not received any revenues from the sale of products 
we have funded our research and development primarily from equity derived working capital and through strategic alliances and collaborations with other companies 
we have not been profitable since our inception and expect to incur substantial operating losses for at least the next several years 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million 
in july  we entered into a collaboration agreement with genencor 
the revenue that we recognize from genencor includes milestone payments  recognition of upfront license fees over the term of the contract and contract revenue to support our research over the term of the collaboration 
as of december   genencor owned of our common stock and is therefore considered a related party for financial reporting purposes 
therefore  all payments that we receive under this agreement are itemized under the category  related party revenue 
in february  we preliminarily agreed with anosys  inc to merge our operations to create a combined company focused on the field of immunotherapeutics and products for the treatment of cancer and infectious diseases 
the all stock transaction is subject to the parties entering into a definitive merger agreement  approval by the shareholders of both companies  obtaining commitments for capital resources to fund the combined company s operations and various other conditions that must be satisfied prior to the merger 
all of the projections  trends and forward looking statements included herein are based on epimmune operating as a stand alone entity 
in the event that this proposed merger is completed  these projections  trends and forward looking statements will likely change  and the changes may be significant 

table of contents significant accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  patents and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements see note to our financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues pursuant to staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
license fees are earned and recognized in accordance with the provisions of each agreement 
upfront license fees for perpetual licenses where we have no performance obligations are recognized when received 
license fees with ongoing involvement or performance obligations are recognized over the term of the agreement 
for example  in connection with our genencor collaboration  because we received an upfront license fee  it is being amortized into revenue over the collaboration term 
milestone payments are recognized as revenue upon the completion of the milestone as long as the milestone event was substantive  and its achievability was not reasonably assured at inception and the company s performance obligations after milestone achievement will continue to be funded at a comparable level before the milestone achievement 
revenues from grants are recognized on a percentage of completion basis as related costs are incurred 
we defer revenue recognition until performance obligations have been completed and collectibility is reasonably assured 
patents we capitalize the costs incurred to file patent applications when we believe there is a high likelihood that the patent will issue and there will be future economic benefit associated with the patent 
these costs are amortized over a ten year life from the date of patent filing 
we expense all costs related to abandoned patent applications 
in addition  we review the carrying value of patents for indicators of impairment on a periodic basis 
if we elect to abandon any of our currently issued or unissued patents or we determine that the carrying value is impaired  the related expense could be material to our results of operations for the period of the abandonment 
investment policy the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time achieving competitive yields  without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we primarily invest in cash and money market accounts as well as a or p or higher rated debt securities with maturities of less than two years  with the weighted average maturity not to exceed eighteen months 
we also attempt to minimize our portfolio risk by placing constraints on how much of our portfolio may be held in a specific type of investment such as asset backed securities or collateralized mortgage obligations as well as limiting our holdings in any one issuer 
at december   our investment portfolio included only cash and money market accounts and had no fixed income securities 
results of operations we had total revenues of million for the year ended december   compared to million in and million in the decrease of in relates primarily to a reduction of million in license fees and milestone payments we received compared to  partially offset by an increase of 
table of contents million in related party revenue we received in compared to license fee and milestone revenue for the year ended december  included recognition of non recurring license fees associated with numerous license agreements we entered into during that period  including agreements with biosite  anosys  nexell and pharmexa 
for the year ended december   we received million in research grants and contract revenue compared to million received in the year ended december  we had related party revenue of million in the year ended december  compared to million of related party revenue in the year ended december  the increase in related party revenue was due to reimbursement for expenditures on our genencor collaboration and amortization of license fees associated with the genencor collaboration that was entered into in july total revenues increased in compared to  due primarily to receipt of upfront  one time payment of license fees in connection with transactions completed in  an increase in related party revenue and increased grant and contract payments in compared to research and development expenses increased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  the increase in relates primarily to an increase of million in outside costs related to preclinical activities such as formulation and toxicology studies for our hiv and lung and colorectal cancer programs  an increase of million in labor and related costs  including recruitment and relocation as a result of an increase in our personnel responsible for research and development activities  an increase of million associated with amortization and other costs related to increased spending to prosecute our patent portfolio and an increase of million on scientific supplies due to increased research and development efforts and our collaboration with genencor 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in  primarily as a result of higher labor and related costs due to increased staffing and salary increases  expensing costs related to abandoned patents in  increased expenditures on general scientific supplies  higher equipment related costs and increased costs for sponsored research as part of our hiv grant program during the period 
we expect our research and development expenses to continue to significantly increase in  compared with those of  as we continue our clinical trials for our hiv vaccine and our lung and colorectal cancer vaccine 
we expect to continue to incur costs in for  among other things  product formulation  manufacturing of product for use in clinical trials  medical and clinical consultant costs and product development costs for additional vaccine candidates 
general and administrative costs were approximately million in the year ended december  and million in the year ended december  the decrease in was primarily due to million less paid for bonuses in compared to  a benefit of million of stock compensation related to a lower stock price for variable stock equity instruments  and a decrease of million in legal expenses in compared to these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in payroll and related expenses and a million increase in consultant expenses in compared to general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in  primarily due to increased labor  recruiting and related costs  increased legal expenses resulting from licensing and collaborative efforts during the period and million of stock based compensation recorded in we had no restructuring related charges in or compared to a reduction or reversal of restructuring charges of million in related to the termination of non epimmune operations in we had negligible other income in and compared to other income of million in the amount represents a payment from elan international services  or elan  of million related to the assignment of a license and the release of million from escrow under an agreement between cytel and neose technologies  inc for the purchase of certain assets 
net interest income was approximately million in compared to million in and million in interest income during includes million of interest accrued on the note issued for the purchase in january of our common stock by dr 
loria  our president and chief executive officer 
higher average cash balances in were offset by lower average returns than in due to lower interest rates 
the decrease in from was based on lower average returns on cash balances 

table of contents we expect to incur operating losses over at least the next several years due to continuing expenses associated with our research and development programs  including development activities  preclinical testing and clinical trials 
operating losses may fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of differences in the timing and amounts of revenues received and expenses incurred  and such fluctuations may be substantial 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed operations since inception primarily through private placements of our equity securities  two public common stock offerings  license fees  revenues under collaborative research and development agreements  grant revenues  capital and operating lease transactions  certain asset divestitures and interest income 
through december  we have raised approximately million from the sale of equity securities  of which million was raised to fund the business since the formation of our business related to immunotherapy 
as of december   we had  shares outstanding on an as converted to common stock basis  assuming conversion of the series s and s preferred shares 
as of december   our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million compared to million at december  the decrease was primarily due to million of cash used to fund the company s research activities and million of cash for capitalized patent expenses  offset by licensing and grant revenues 
we expect to continue to use our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments to fund our ongoing clinical trials  drug research and development programs 
we had net working capital of million as of december  compared to million as of december  capital expenditures for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the expenditures for were primarily for laboratory equipment to increase and improve immunological screening throughput  to build out additional laboratory space to accommodate additional employees and for information technology equipment and upgrades to accommodate new employees 
capital expenditures for and were primarily for laboratory equipment 
in the past  we have financed our laboratory equipment and research and office facilities primarily through operating lease arrangements and a note payable 
during  and we made payments under the notes payable of million  million and million  respectively 
during  we anticipate that payments related to leasehold improvements and capital expenditures will decrease compared to levels to a range of approximately million to million 
we will also pay approximately million in rent on our lease commitments during the future minimum rental commitment for the lease of our facility will range from approximately million to million each year over seven years  based upon pre established annual rent increases 
payments related to capitalized patent expenses were approximately million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the increase in each year over the prior year was primarily as a result of maturity of our portfolio filings and pursuit of additional claims 
we expect payments related to patents to be relatively flat in compared to as we continue to pursue filings and claims in our intellectual property portfolio 
we expect to incur additional research and development expenditures in compared to levels in connection with our ongoing drug research and development programs  including costs related to preclinical testing  clinical trials and manufacturing 
we intend to seek collaborative research and development relationships with suitable corporate partners and us government agencies 
we have in the past and may in the future also license to third parties some of our technology in markets that we are not pursuing ourselves or through our collaborations 
any agreements that may result from these discussions may not successfully reduce our funding requirements or  if entered into  may be terminated 
we currently anticipate that total revenue for will be in the range of million to million  which includes anticipated grant and contract revenue  related party revenue and certain license fees 
our estimate assumes that we recognize revenue from milestone or licensing payments under existing agreements with third parties related to the licensing of our technology 
we also anticipate that operating expenses for the full year will rise from million in to between approximately million and million  representing a to increase over the anticipated rise in expenses relates to beginning our 
table of contents phase i ii clinical trial targeting hiv in september and our phase i ii clinical trial targeting lung and colorectal cancer in february we also anticipate using some of our cash and investment in to fund our collaboration with bavarian nordic 
we will share equally with bavarian nordic in all research related expenses and have included these anticipated expenditures in our operating expense forecast for we will also become liable in for payment of license fees of up to million 
we anticipate that our existing cash and investments and interest earned thereon  along with the cash receipts related to existing contracts will enable us to maintain our current and planned operations through december we will continue to spend substantial amounts on research and development  including amounts spent for manufacturing clinical supplies  conducting clinical trials for our product candidates and expanding our drug development programs 
therefore  we will need to raise additional funding and we do not have committed external sources of funding and may not be able to obtain any additional funding  especially if weak market conditions persist for biotechnology companies 
if we are unable to obtain additional funding  we may be forced to curtail certain operations to focus on our primary research and development activities 
our future operational and capital requirements will depend on many factors  including whether the proposed merger with anosys and related financing occurs the costs associated with our clinical trials for our vaccine targeting hiv  which began in the third quarter of  the costs associated with our clinical trials for our vaccine targeting lung and colorectal cancer  which began in february  progress with other preclinical testing and clinical trials in the future  our ability to establish and maintain collaborative research and development arrangements and license agreements  the actual revenue we receive under our collaborative research and development agreements  the actual costs we incur under our research collaboration with bavarian nordic  the actual payment of license fees which may become payable at the option of the licensor  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs involved in filing  prosecuting  enforcing and defending patent claims and any other proprietary rights  competing technological and market developments  changes in our existing research relationships  continued scientific progress in our drug discovery programs  and the magnitude of our drug discovery and development programs 
as is typical in the biotechnology industry  our commercial success will depend in part on not infringing upon the patent or other proprietary rights of others and maintaining the technology licenses upon which our products might be based 
our business is also subject to other significant risks  including the uncertainties associated with our ability to enter into and maintain new collaborations  the lengthy regulatory approval process  and potential competition from other products 
even if our products appear promising at an early stage of development  they may not reach the market for a number of reasons 
such reasons include  but are not limited to  our inability to fund clinical development of such products  or the possibilities that the potential products will be found ineffective during clinical trials  fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals  be difficult to manufacture on a large scale or be uneconomical to market
