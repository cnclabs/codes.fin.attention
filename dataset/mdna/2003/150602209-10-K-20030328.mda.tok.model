recent accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin significantly changes the current practice in the accounting for  and disclosure of  guarantees 
guarantees and indemnification agreements meeting the characteristics described in fin are required to be initially recorded as a liability at fair value 
fin also requires a guarantor to make significant new disclosures for virtually all guarantees even if the likelihood of the guarantor having to make payment under the guarantee is remote 
the disclosure requirements within fin are effective for financial statements for annual or interim periods ending after december  the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the company is currently evaluating the effects of fin on the company s results of operations or financial condition

business combinations  and statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and intangibles  respectively 
these standards govern business combinations and asset acquisitions  and the accounting for acquired intangibles

liquidity and capital resources the company funds its operating expenses primarily from operating cash flows  although  if needed  the company may also use its bank line of credit for this purpose 
the company funds acquisitions  developments  and other capital expenditures primarily from available cash  property specific item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued mortgage indebtedness  joint venture partner equity contributions  its line of credit  and to a lesser extent  operating cash flows 
the company may also acquire properties through the issuance of limited partnership units of the operating partnership 
additionally  the company may dispose of certain properties  reinvesting the proceeds from such dispositions into properties with better growth potential or more consistent with its strategic focus 
the company focuses its investment activities on community and neighborhood shopping centers  primarily located in pennsylvania and new jersey  anchored principally by regional and national grocery store chains 
the company continues to seek acquisition opportunities where it can utilize its experience in shopping center renovation  expansion  re leasing and re merchandising to achieve long term cash flow growth and favorable investment returns 
the company would also consider investment opportunities in markets beyond the pennsylvania and new jersey area in the event such opportunities were consistent with its focus  could be effectively controlled and managed by it  and provided the potential to create favorable investment returns and increased value to its shareholders 
the company s financial liquidity is provided by million in cash and cash equivalents at december  and by the unused balance of its million bank line of credit 
in march the company entered into a new line of credit that will contribute to its liquidity during see below 
the company also believes that it has sufficient flexibility to fund the required payments in connection with the swh financing  property level capital expenditures  tenant improvements  leasing costs and mortgage and other scheduled principal payments  including the million based on  alternative amortization schedule due with respect to the swh financing in the company s ability  however  to meet these obligations is dependent in large part on its ability to attract a joint venture partner or suitable financing for the camp hill redevelopment project 
based on preliminary discussions with several potential partners  the company believes it will be successful in arranging a transaction that will allow it to withdraw a significant portion of its equity investment in camp hill while retaining a substantial portion of the upside potential in the redevelopment 
however  no assurances can be given that such an arrangement will ultimately be finalized 
mortgage debt outstanding at december  consisted of fixed rate notes totaling million with a weighted average interest rate of  maturing at various dates through short term liquidity requirements include debt service payments due within one year 
the scheduled principal payments of mortgage debt in total  the company expects to fund short term liquidity requirements  including mortgage principal payments with operating cash flows and draw downs under its line of credit 
while the company currently expects to fund long term liquidity requirements primarily through a combination of issuing additional mortgage debt and equity securities and with borrowings under the bank line of credit  there can be no assurance that it will in fact be able to repay or refinance its indebtedness on commercially reasonable or any other terms 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued in march  the company entered into a one year million unsecured line of credit facility with north fork bank  melville  new york 
the line of credit bore interest at the greater of or the bank s prime rate plus 
the line of credit was repaid on january  the company entered into a new line of credit facility effective as of march  for a one year period at the same rates as the previous facility and with a million limit  provided  however  that the additional million will be available only when the swh financing has been repaid 
the company obtained a million libor based construction loan in connection with the la fitness development project 
the loan is due on december   has a two year extension option  and carries interest at libor plus basis points 
subsequent to year end  the company purchased a sole general partnership interest in three additional shopping centers located near harrisburg  pennsylvania  aggregating approximately  square feet of leaseable space 
in the aggregate these centers cost approximately million  the company s general partnership interest cost million and kimco preferred investors iii as limited partner invested  the balance of the purchase price was financed by three separate mortgage loans aggregating approximately million 
one loan is for ten years with a fixed rate of and the company entered into interest rate swaps for the entire amounts and for the seven year terms of the other two of the loans  which results in a fixed rate of 
the blended interest rate for all three loans amounts to significant portions of the company s assets are owned through joint venture partnership arrangements see property table in item 
as the company is the sole general partner in these joint venture arrangements with substantial control over ownership operations  it prepares its financial statements on a consolidated basis 
the joint venture partnership agreements require  among other things  that the company maintain separate cash accounts for the operation of the joint venture and distributions to the general and limited partners are strictly controlled 
these arrangements to date have not resulted in any significant liquidity shortfalls at the company or the partnership level  however  the company or any combination of the joint venture partnerships could suffer a liquidity crisis while other members of the group have sufficient liquidity 
joint venture cash amounted to million at december  the terms of certain of the company s mortgage agreements require it to deposit certain replacement and other reserves with its lenders 
this restricted cash is generally available for property level capital requirements for which the reserve was established 
this cash is not  however  available to fund other property level or company level obligations 
such restricted cash amounted to million at december  the company expects that capital markets in the united states will continue to be active and will provide funds for the refinancing of its indebtedness as such indebtedness matures over the next two to ten years 
with the exception of the citizens bank first mortgage financing on the camp hill property and the construction loan on the la fitness property  all such mortgages are amortizing loans 
the balances due at maturity and the annual amortization payments are summarized below 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the combined aggregate future principal payments of mortgages  notes loans at december  are as follows line of credit and loans and other notes year mortgages payable payable total thereafter   as the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december   it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date 
moreover  because future commitments are not presented in the table above  the information presented has limited predictive value 
as a result  the ultimate financial impact with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period  the company s hedging strategies and interest rates at that time 
funds from operations the company generally considers funds from operations ffo to be a relevant and meaningful supplemental measure of the performance of an equity reit because it is predicated on a cash flow analysis  contrasted with net income  a measure predicated on generally accepted accounting principles which gives effect to non cash items such as depreciation 
the company computes ffo in accordance with the april white paper on ffo published by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit  as income before allocation to minority interest computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization  and after preferred stock distributions and adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are computed to reflect ffo on the same basis 
in computing ffo  the company does not add back to net income the amortization of costs incurred in connection with our financing activities or depreciation of non real estate assets  but does add back to net income those items that are defined as extraordinary under gaap 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity 
since the nareit white paper only provides guidelines for computing ffo  the computation of ffo may vary from one reit to another 
ffo is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued inflation low to moderate levels of inflation during the past several years have favorably impacted the company s operations by stabilizing operating expenses 
at the same time  low inflation had an indirect effect of reducing the company s ability to increase tenant rents 
the company s properties have tenants whose leases include expense reimbursements and other provisions to minimize the effect of inflation 
these factors  in the long run  are expected to result in more attractive returns from the company s real estate portfolio as compared to short term investment vehicles

the company does not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
the company will recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
derivatives that are not hedges will be adjusted to fair value through income 
if a derivative is a hedge  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in the fair value of the derivative will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets  liability or firm commitment through earnings  or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings
