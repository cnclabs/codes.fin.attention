item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we provide pharmacy services to patients on behalf of managed care organizations and other third party payors 
we contract with payors to provide home infusion therapy  specialty pharmacy and other related services to patients at home or at other alternate site settings  such as physicians offices 
as of december   our pharmacy and related services are provided locally through our nationwide network of owned and franchised pharmacy locations 
we have three distinct service lines infusion and related healthcare services  specialty pharmacy  and other 
summarized information about revenue for each service line is provided in the following table years ended december  revenue infusion and related healthcare services specialty pharmacy other total revenue most of our revenue is generated from managed care contracts and other agreements with commercial third party payors 
our principal managed care contract is with blue cross and blue shield of florida  inc bc bs of florida 
in  and  approximately  and of our revenue was related to this contract 
as of december  and  approximately and of option care s accounts receivable was due from bc bs of florida 
our contract with bc bs of florida is terminable by either party on days notice and  unless terminated  renews annually each september for an additional one year term 
this contract renewed in september with no changes 
for the years  and  respectively  approximately  and of our revenue came from governmental programs such as medicare and medicaid 
as of december  and december   respectively  approximately and of total accounts receivable were due from these programs 
many governmental payors reimburse us for some pharmaceuticals based on that pharmaceutical s average wholesale price 
in many cases  we purchase pharmaceuticals at less than average wholesale price awp 
awp for most pharmaceuticals is compiled and published by private companies  including first databank  inc there has been an increase in the number of lawsuits and government investigations against pharmaceutical manufacturers regarding prescription drug pricing and awp  alleging that manufacturers have misrepresented to first databank the actual selling price of certain pharmaceuticals 
first databank has announced that it will now base average wholesale prices on market prices rather than on prices submitted by the manufacturer 
as a result of this change  first databank has published a market price survey that reduces the average wholesale price significantly for a number of the products we currently supply to patients 
if the average wholesale prices on the products we purchase are reduced  our gross profit margins could decline 
we have been reducing the number of our franchised locations since to increase operational efficiency  most often by consolidating  terminating or acquiring franchises 
however  since  royalty revenue has been fairly stable 
any losses in royalty revenue due to the reduction in number of franchises have been substantially offset by increased royalty revenue generated by the continuing franchises 
due to increases in revenue from infusion and related healthcare services and from specialty pharmacy services  royalty revenue continues to decline as a percentage of option care s total revenue 
during  we completed five acquisitions 
four of the acquisitions were in new geographical markets and the fifth allowed us to expand our presence in the hemophilia market 
the aggregate purchase price for these acquisitions was million paid in cash at closing  plus another million in additional consideration 
we paid  of the million additional consideration during december the remaining additional consideration is payable in acquisitions will remain an integral part of our overall growth strategy 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and their related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  option care evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable 
actual results may vary from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we annually review our financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies to ensure that our financial reporting and disclosures provide accurate and transparent information relative to our financial condition and results of operations  as well as our current business environment 
option care management believes that of our significant accounting policies  the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and or complexity 
revenue recognition contractual adjustments our revenue is primarily derived from the sale of infusible and injectible pharmaceuticals and the provision of related nursing services to patients at alternate site settings 
most of this revenue is billed under managed care or other contracts  with a small amount billed under government programs  such as medicare and medicaid 
billed and unbilled revenue is recorded net of contractual adjustments based on our interpretation of the terms of each managed care contract or government contract or pricing schedule 
the accuracy of our recorded net revenue is subject to the accuracy of payor information on file for each patient  and is also subject to our correct interpretation of each underlying contract with respect to reimbursement rates for the drugs and services we provided 
if changes are subsequently required to either payor information or our interpretation of the reimbursement rates of our contracts  we adjust revenue in the period that such changes are identified 
such adjustments may have a positive or negative impact on the revenues and results of operations reported for those subsequent periods 
historically  such adjustments have not been significant to our statements of income 
accounts receivable we record our accounts receivable net of contractual adjustments as described in the preceding paragraph and net of allowances for doubtful accounts 
the procedure for estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts requires significant judgment and assumptions 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based on several factors  including our past accounts receivable collection history  consideration of the age of the accounts receivable at the end of each period  and detailed analysis of the expected collectibility of the amounts receivable from each significant payor based on a number of factors 
the allowance for doubtful accounts also considers the fact that in certain circumstances  our accounts receivable may also be subject to retroactive adjustments by payors 
although we believe that our estimation of the net value of our accounts receivable is reasonable  actual collections may differ from our estimates of collectibility  affecting our future financial condition and results of operations 
goodwill and other intangible assets we record goodwill from our acquisitions equal to the excess of the total cost of the acquisitions over the fair value of all identified tangible and intangible assets acquired 
in accordance with statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets  issued in june  effective january  we no longer amortize goodwill but rather test our goodwill annually for impairment 
our method of impairment testing consists of comparing the market value of our company to its book value 
the market value is equal to the current value of our common stock times the total number of shares outstanding 
we completed an initial impairment test as of january   and completed our annual impairment test for as of october  no impairment was identified from either test 
subsequently  in the fourth quarter we recognized a  write down of goodwill related to the planned disposal of two of our pharmacy locations 
prior to adoption of the non amortization provisions of sfas no 
 we had amortized goodwill straight line over estimated useful lives of to years 
other intangible assets primarily consist of non compete agreements  payor contracts and patient records 
these intangible assets are amortized straight line over periods ranging from two to five years 
their amortization period equals their estimated useful lives  or in the case of non compete agreements  their contractual term 
results of operations the following table shows certain statement of income items expressed as a percentage of revenue for the years ended december   and years ended december  revenue cost of revenue cost of goods cost of service total cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative provision for doubtful accounts amortization of goodwill total operating expenses operating income other expenses other expense  net interest expense total other expense  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income years ended december  and for  option care s revenue was million  an increase of million  or  from the million in this growth in revenue was driven primarily by acquisitions  by increased penetration of existing managed care relationships  and by the establishment of new managed care and manufacturer relationships 
pharmacies acquired in and accounted for approximately million  or  of the revenue growth 
increases in same store sales accounted for the remaining million in revenue growth 
roughly half of this million was from increased sales of specialty pharmaceuticals by our florida optionmed pharmacies  whose revenue is predominantly driven by our contract with blue cross and blue shield of florida 
the remaining increase was due to our efforts to increase market penetration of our specialty pharmacy services  and to same store increases in patient census for our core home infusion therapies 
the following table sets forth our revenue by product line years ended december  amounts of revenue amounts of revenue amounts of revenue amounts in thousands revenue infusion and related healthcare services   specialty pharmacy    other    total revenue    breaking down our revenue by product line  our infusion and related healthcare services revenue increased  from million in to million in specialty pharmacy revenue showed a much higher growth rate  with revenue increasing from million in to million in other revenues declined  from million in to million in the increase in infusion and related healthcare services revenue was primarily from acquisitions 
current year same store infusion and related healthcare services revenues remained fairly consistent with the prior year 
the large increase in specialty pharmacy revenue was divided in near equal proportion among three sources increases in same store sales  increased volume under our optionmed contracts  primarily our contract with blue cross and blue shield of florida  and incremental revenue from and acquisitions 
the overall increase in specialty pharmacy revenue is due to several factors  including efforts to cross sell specialty pharmaceuticals to our existing infusion pharmacy managed care clients  and due to volume increases under our existing specialty pharmacy contracts 
we also expanded our specialty pharmacy product line through acquisitions and through partnering with specialty drug manufacturers  and increased market penetration for existing products  such as synagis 
other revenues for consist of million in royalties and related fees from our franchises  million of mbi software sales and support  and  of other miscellaneous revenues 
in the prior year  other revenue consisted of million of royalties and related fees  million of mbi software sales and support and in other miscellaneous revenues 
the  decline in royalties was primarily due to a small reduction in the number of franchise locations in the  decline in mbi software revenue was due to the lack of new sales of the current mbi software  which is not being actively marketed because mbi is in the final beta testing stages of a new  browser based software which will be released in our gross profit of million represents an increase of million  or  over our gross profit of million in the increase in gross profit was the result of our revenue increase of million 
as a percentage of revenue  our overall gross profit margin declined from in to in this overall decline is due to stronger sales of specialty pharmaceuticals  which typically have a higher cost and lower margin than home infusion drugs and services 
the gross profit margins of our two primary service lines  infusion and related healthcare services and specialty pharmacy  remained fairly stable year to year 
for infusion and related healthcare services  our gross profit margin increased from in to in this increase was due to changes in therapy mix 
our specialty pharmacy gross profit margin increased from in to for the increase is also due to changes in product mix  notably the increase in sales of blood factor products  which have a higher gross profit margin than most of our other specialty pharmacy products 
total operating expenses increased to million in  which was an increase of million  or  over acquisitions accounted for approximately million  or  of this increase  through overhead expenses incurred directly by the acquired offices and through incremental increases in corporate staffing necessary to oversee the management of their operations 
of the remaining million increase in operating expenses  million was related to a charge for the planned disposal of our company owned pharmacies in bullhead city  arizona and grand junction  colorado 
most of the remaining million was related to an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts  offset in part by a decrease in amortization of goodwill resulting from the adoption of sfas no 
on january  our provision for doubtful accounts increased by million  or  from million in to million in the primarily reason for this increase was our increase in revenue in versus the prior year 
as a percentage of revenue  the provision for doubtful accounts increased from in to in increasing reserves related to acquisitions in general  and more specifically due to our consolidation of four dallas  texas area offices into one office were the primary causes of this increase in percentage 
another factor was a charge of  to the provision for doubtful accounts which was part of the overall million charge related to our planned disposal of our company owned pharmacies in bullhead city  arizona and grand junction  colorado 
goodwill amortization expense decreased from million in to  in in keeping with the provisions of sfas no 
 we no longer amortize goodwill but instead complete annual tests of our goodwill for impairment 
we completed our annual impairment test as of october  and identified no impairment at that time 
however  we subsequently initiated plans to dispose of our operations in bullhead city  arizona and grand junction  colorado 
as part of an overall charge related to the planned disposal of these pharmacies  we recognized an impairment charge of  in the fourth quarter of interest expense for was  compared to million in this decline was due to lower debt levels resulting from the underwritten public offering of stock we completed in october prior to the completion of this stock offering  we had accumulated nearly million in debt from funding the acquisitions we completed in the first half of the stock offering generated million in cash  and we paid off this debt balance in the fourth quarter of our current year interest expense was mostly incurred during the second half of  as we borrowed on our credit facility to finance the acquisition of allina health system s infusion pharmacy operations in july the income tax provision increased by million  or  for compared to the prior year 
this increase approximates our increase in income before income taxes in compared to as a percentage of income before income taxes  our provision increased from in to in this slight increase was due to an increase in business in states with higher state income tax rates 
our net income was million  which represents an increase of million  or  over the million net income in this increase was primarily due to expansion of our business through acquisitions and emphasis on increasing market penetration for specialty pharmaceuticals 
net income equaled of revenue in compared to of revenue in this decline in net income as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to a million charge related to the decision to dispose of our bullhead city  arizona and grand junction  colorado offices and to our increase in provision for doubtful accounts  particularly for our dallas  texas area operations 
these factors were partially offset by our reduction in interest expense 
the increase in net income resulted in a increase in earnings per diluted share  which climbed to in versus in diluted shares increased from million for to million for this million share increase was primarily due to the effect of our underwritten public offering of stock completed in october the full effect of this offering was reflected in our weighted average share counts  while only about of the effect was reflected in the prior year share counts 
other factors increasing our diluted shares outstanding included stock option exercises and the issuance of shares under option care s employee stock purchase plan 
all share and per share amounts presented in this annual report on form k have been adjusted to reflect the for stock split we completed in april net cash flow provided by operations in was million  compared to million used by operations in the primary reasons for this million change were our increased net income and a change in the structure of the acquisitions we completed in compared to those completed in for the majority of our acquisitions  we did not purchase accounts receivable from the sellers  causing those acquired offices to have initial negative operating cash flows until we started collecting on post acquisition revenue 
for most of our acquisitions  we did acquire accounts receivable  minimizing initial negative operating cash flows 
acquisitions used million of cash flow from operations  while existing operations provided million of cash flow from operations 
for acquisitions  growth in accounts receivable balances due to integration and consolidation issues  particularly in our dallas  texas offices  was the main cause of their negative operating cash flow 
for our existing business  the million cash flow from operations was due to our increased net income  combined with a reduction in our days sales outstanding as of december  compared to december  this reduction was in part due to the increase in specialty pharmacy revenue  which tends to have a shorter collection cycle than home infusion and other related services 
net cash flow used in investing activities for was million  compared to million used in we used million in to fund our five acquisitions and the additional consideration due on prior years acquisitions 
in  we used million to fund acquisitions 
option care used million in cash during to acquire equipment and other fixed assets  compared to million used for such purchases in of the current year s total million use of cash to acquire equipment and other fixed assets  million was for infusion pumps and other revenue producing medical equipment  and million was spent on the development of software  the majority of which was for the development of mbi s new emphsys system 
another million was spent on leasehold improvements related to the build out of our new corporate offices and on the relocation of several of our company owned pharmacies 
the remaining million was used to upgrade computer systems and for various other office furniture and equipment 
financing activities provided million in cash in compared to million provided in in  our primary source of financing cash flow was borrowings of million under our credit and security agreement with jp morgan business credit corporation 
these borrowings help fund our acquisitions in in securing this agreement  we used  in cash to pay the loan fees and other related costs 
during  we repaid a net amount of million owed under our previous credit facility 
our underwritten public stock offering in october generated million in cash  and made it possible for us to pay off our existing credit facility debt balance 
in  we made payments of  on capital leases  loans and notes payable  while in the prior year  our net repayment was zero as proceeds from signing new notes offset our payments on existing debts 
in  million in cash was provided from the issuance of common stock  both from the exercise of stock options and from employees purchase of stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
in the prior year  million in cash was provided through these means 
years ended december  and our revenue increased by million  or  to million in this million growth in revenue during was primarily from pharmacies acquired in and  and due to increased sales of both infusion therapy drugs and specialty drugs 
approximately million  or of the overall revenue growth was from infusion and related healthcare services  and million  or of the increase was from sales of specialty pharmaceuticals  offset by a  decline in other revenue 
the increases in both infusion and specialty pharmacy revenues were due to acquisitions  same store sales increases  and a revenue increase of million in our optionmed offices  primarily due to higher sales volume under our contract with blue cross and blue shield of florida 
other revenues  which consist of royalty fees  software sales and support and other miscellaneous revenues declined by  or  in versus a reduction in new sales of mbi software products was the primary reason for this decline 
our gross profit of million represented an increase of million  or  over this increase was primarily attributed to the million increase in revenue 
however  as a percentage of revenue  our gross profit margin declined from in to in this decrease is due to the stronger growth in sales of specialty pharmaceuticals relative to sales of home infusion drugs and services 
specialty pharmaceuticals are higher cost  lower margin products  and therefore generate a lower gross profit percentage than our infusion therapy products 
a reduced pricing schedule under option care s contract with blue cross and blue shield of florida  which became effective at the beginning of the second quarter of  was part of the reason for our overall decline in gross profit margin percentage 
however  due to increased sales volume  the gross profit generated by our regional specialty pharmacy segment increased by  over the prior year 
total operating expenses increased by million  or  in compared to the prior year 
approximately million of this increase resulted from our acquisitions completed in and  consisting of the operating expenses incurred directly by those newly acquired offices and the increases in corporate staffing required to support them 
the remaining million increase was due to a variety of factors  including increases in the cost of providing health insurance to our employees  and increases in staffing and various other operating expenses necessary to manage increased revenues and patient volume 
our provision for doubtful accounts increased by million  or  from to this increase is directly related to the increase in revenue over this period 
as a percentage of revenue  the provision for doubtful accounts increased from in to in this slight increase was due to the greater increase in infusion revenue relative to specialty pharmacy revenue in the increase was expected 
our infusion and related healthcare services service line typically incurs a slightly higher level of bad debts than our specialty pharmacy service line because of having to bill proportionately more claims to more payors to generate the same revenues 
goodwill amortization expense increased by  due to additional goodwill resulting from our acquisitions and additional consideration paid on our   and acquisitions 
our interest expense of million for was  higher than the million incurred in the increase was primarily due to expenditures for the purchase price and initial operating cash needs of business we acquired in  which increased debt until the completion of our underwritten public offering of stock in october the income tax provision increased million  or  for versus this increase was primarily due to the increase in income before income taxes from to income taxes were provided for at a rate in compared to in this increase in our income tax rate was primarily due to our increase in income before income taxes  which increased our federal income tax rate from to 
also  we expanded our operations in some states with relatively higher state income tax rates  which placed upward pressure on our overall tax rate 
we recorded net income of million in  which represents an increase of million  or  over the million in net income equaled of revenue in compared to of revenue in this decline in net income as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to the increase in sales of specialty pharmaceuticals by both our optionmed pharmacies and our option care pharmacies 
specialty pharmaceuticals are higher cost  lower margin drugs than our home infusion products  and therefore produce a lower net income percentage 
another factor contributing to the decline in net income as a percentage of revenue was the price reductions under our managed care contract with blue cross and blue shield of florida 
as a result of the increase in net income  earnings per diluted share increased  from in to in our increase in net income more than offset the increase in diluted shares outstanding 
the increase in diluted shares outstanding was primarily due to the weighted average impact of our issuance of  new shares of common stock in october through an underwritten public offering 
other factors increasing our diluted shares outstanding included stock option exercises and the issuance of shares under option care s employee stock purchase plan 
net cash flow used by operations in was million  compared to million provided by operations in of the million use of cash by operations  million was used to fund the operational cash needs of businesses acquired in and in all but one of these acquisitions  we did not purchase the existing accounts receivable 
therefore  our million use of cash by our acquisitions can be directly attributed to the million buildup of accounts receivable from their operations after purchase 
in addition to the million increase in accounts receivable attributed to our acquisitions  another million of increase in accounts receivable came from the growth in revenues of our ongoing operations 
these ongoing operations provided million in operating cash flows in  primarily due to their overall profitability 
net cash flow used in investing activities for was million  compared to million in we used million in the year for acquisitions  of which million consisted of cash payments for the nine asset purchase agreements signed in  and  was for additional consideration on prior years acquisitions 
option care also used million for the purchase of equipment and fixed assets  which includes million used to pay for new assets  less  provided by the sale and retirement of assets 
of the million used to buy new assets  million was spent on new software development projects  million was spent for infrastructure improvements  such as new computer and office equipment  and  was spent for rental medical equipment 
the remaining  provided by investing activities was generated from the sale of various other assets 
financing activities provided million in cash in by contrast  in  million was provided 
in october  we completed an underwritten public offering of common stock 
this offering generated approximately million in net proceeds  which accounts for the majority of the million of cash provided in by the issuance of common stock 
the remaining million came from employee withholdings for purchase of shares under the employee stock purchase plan  and from the exercise of stock options 
in addition to providing million in cash  the underwritten public offering allowed us to repay the outstanding balance on our credit facility  which was million as of december  finally  we used  in cash to reduce our cash overdraft to zero as of december   as we had a positive cash balance of million on that date

option care s results of operations are partially affected by seasonal factors 
one of the specialty drugs that we distribute  synagis  is a preventive drug used to protect high risk pediatric patients against respiratory synctial virus 
the virus is seasonal  primarily affecting patients during the months from october through april 
our quarterly revenue from sales of synagis in and was as follows in thousands q q q q q q q q synagis revenue     liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations and acquisitions from operating cash flows  common stock offerings and borrowings 
our principal demands for liquidity are working capital  acquisition activities and debt service 
on march   we entered into a million revolving credit and security agreement with jp morgan business credit corporation  which serves as advisor  jp morgan chase bank  which serves as administrator  collateral agent and arranger  and lasalle bank  national association  which serves as co agent 
the credit facility requires us to meet certain financial covenants 
option care paid a facility fee of approximately  upon signing the agreement 
the agreement provides for a commitment fee  calculated and paid quarterly on a sliding scale from to  based on the average daily unused portion of the facility 
for a fee  option care may secure up to million in letters of credit 
depending on our level of borrowing under the agreement  option care may select interest rates ranging from the eurodollar rate plus to  or the bank s reference rate plus to 
the agreement expires on march  availability under the facility is related to various percentages of option care s net outstanding accounts receivable and inventory balances  less certain capped and ineligible amounts  as defined in the agreement 
overall borrowings under the agreement will be limited to the lesser of the remaining availability under the agreement and the total allowable collateral borrowing base 
based on our accounts receivable and inventory balances as of december   we have additional borrowing availability of million over our current outstanding balance of million under the facility 
the facility is secured by substantially all of our assets 
in addition to customary events of default  the facility provides that a change in control of the company would give rise to an event of default 
we are prohibited from declaring and paying cash dividends on our common stock during the life of this agreement 
our total working capital as of december  was million  compared to million as of december  the million increase in working capital year over year was primarily due to the million increase in accounts receivable during the period  less the million reduction in cash and cash equivalents and less the million increase in deferred purchase price liabilities 
the primary driver of all of these changes was our acquisition activity during  which increased the scale of our business and thus our accounts receivable  and reduced our cash reserves 
we intend to fund our future capital needs through operating cash flows and borrowings on our credit facility 
in the event that additional capital is required beyond the limitation of our credit facility  we may not be able to obtain such capital from other sources on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
our business strategy includes the selective acquisition of additional local pharmacy facilities 
accordingly  we may require additional capital in order to complete these acquisitions 
it is impossible to predict the amount of capital that may be required for acquisitions  and there is no assurance that sufficient financing for these activities will be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on our financing and cash management activities 
we utilize a mix of debt maturities along with both fixed rate and variable rate debt to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates 
although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not change significantly  we do not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in as of december   our fixed rate debt was  and our variable rate debt was million 
as of december   our fixed rate debt was  and we had no variable rate debt 
based on our variable rate debt balance at december   a one percent increase in interest rates would increase annual interest expense by
