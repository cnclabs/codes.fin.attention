part i item business general curis  inc is a therapeutic drug development company 
our technology focus is on regulatory signaling pathways that control repair and regeneration of human tissue and organs 
our product development approach involves using proteins or small molecules to modulate these regulatory signaling pathways  for example  to increase the pathway signals when they are insufficient or to decrease them when they are excessive 
we have successfully used this product development approach to produce several promising preclinical product candidates in the fields of kidney disease  neurological disorders  cancer and hair regrowth 
our mission is to discover and develop novel therapeutic drugs to treat diseases and disorders for which there are no adequate therapies or for which a new drug would represent a significant advancement over the current therapy 
we seek to develop new medicines to improve the overall state of human health while at the same time striving to give our shareholders a substantial return on their investment reflective of the risks associated with pharmaceutical drug development 
in the last quarter of  we announced a significant corporate partnership with ortho biotech products  lp a subsidiary of johnson johnson and the monetization of our future revenue stream from stryker corporation 
in addition  we entered into transactions with amylin pharmaceuticals  inc  and es cell international pte  ltd 
in february of  we completed a realignment of our research and development programs and a re focusing of our resources on our proprietary signaling pathways  particularly the bone morphogenic protein bmp and hedgehog hh families of product candidates 
as part of the realignment  we terminated our cell therapy clinical programs  reduced our workforce by people  incurred cash expenses of  and non cash expenses of  and terminated a lease on a  square foot development and manufacturing facility 
in december  we further reduced our workforce by employees for the purpose of reducing our cash burn see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview

signaling pathway technology background through our research  we seek an understanding of the biological signaling pathways that the body uses to promote human tissue and organ repair and regeneration and seek to use that understanding to modulate and control those signaling pathways to promote therapeutic benefit 
each cell in the human body is programmed during the embryonic stage of development to respond to a specific set of signals that regulate its behavior 
signaling pathways deliver messages to cells  which determine how a cell differentiates and also whether it replicates or dies 
the signaling pathways that orchestrate early stages of tissue and organ formation are often the same pathways used by the body in adulthood to maintain physiological balance and to repair and regenerate tissue 
we have used our knowledge of these signaling pathways to build a diverse portfolio of preclinical product candidates in several important therapeutic areas including kidney disease  neurological disorders  cancer and hair regrowth alopecia 
we have developed a significant intellectual property portfolio in several major signaling pathways  including the hedgehog pathway and the bone morphogenetic protein  or bmp  pathway 
both of these pathways are prominent regulators of specific tissue and organ formation during development and are used by the body in adulthood to repair and regulate human tissue 
product development programs we are developing product candidates in several important medical fields where there is substantial therapeutic need that is either unmet or underserved 
these product development initiatives see chart below either are being pursued using our internal resources or have been partnered with pharmaceutical or biotechnology firms that are able to dedicate additional resources and clinical development expertise 
these product development initiatives derive primarily from our substantial intellectual property portfolio in key signaling pathways 
technology primary indication partner status bmp kidney disease ortho biotech j j late preclinical hh agonist neurological disorders elan corporation mid preclinical hh antibody cancer seeking partner mid preclinical hh antagonist basal cell carcinoma seeking partner late preclinical hh agonist alopecia none mid preclinical pyy peptide obesity amylin mid preclinical stem cells diabetes es cell early preclinical bmp kidney disease program over the last several years  we have been developing bmp as a therapeutic compound to halt the progression of chronic kidney failure and to prevent skeletal and blood vessel complications that are associated with chronic kidney disease 
this work  which has been conducted in conjunction with academic and medical research laboratories  has demonstrated therapeutic efficacy in numerous animal models of kidney disease 
in november of  we entered into a partnership with ortho biotech a subsidiary of johnson johnson for the continued development of this kidney disease product candidate 
ortho biotech is a pharmaceutical company with broad expertise in protein based therapeutic drug development and is an established presence in the kidney disease marketplace 
the partnership with ortho biotech also targets the development of bmp based products for the treatment of other medical disorders including stroke and traumatic brain injury 
ortho biotech will assume all future costs and responsibility for bmp based product development and we will receive clinical milestone payments and royalties on product sales  if clinical evaluations of any bmp based products are successful 
hedgehog agonist neurological disorders program we believe that the hedgehog pathway is essential for the formation of normal nerves in the peripheral nervous system as well as in the central nervous system 
our scientists and collaborators have shown that treatment with a hedgehog protein accelerates the restoration of nerve function in animal models of nerve trauma and disease thus suggesting potential therapeutic utility in treating certain human neurological disorders  such as parkinson s disease  diabetic neuropathies  and others 
recently  our scientists have developed a series of small molecule hedgehog agonists that are capable of activating the hedgehog pathway and fostering tissue repair 
many of these small molecule hedgehog agonists are orally available and can cross the blood brain barrier  therefore making them attractive product development candidates 
currently  these small molecule hedgehog agonists are being evaluated in animal models of parkinson s disease  diabetic neuropathy  and other neurological disorders 
the hedgehog agonist neurological disorders program is currently being conducted under our joint venture with elan corporation 
hedgehog antibody cancer program we believe that one of the ways that the hedgehog protein promotes restoration of tissue function  such as the restoration of nerve function in animal models described above  is by inducing the synthesis of multiple growth factors and angiogenic factors 
the growth factors stimulate new tissue formation and the angiogenic factors stimulate new blood vessel growth to nourish the newly formed tissue 
our scientists have recently discovered that certain cancers appear to be inappropriately expressing high concentrations of hedgehog protein thereby creating local environments favorable to the rapid growth of cancerous tissue 
by utilizing an antibody that blocks the action of hedgehog protein  our scientists have been able to significantly slow and  in some cases  halt the growth of certain cancers for example  pancreatic and colon cancers in animal models of solid tumor growth 
we are currently evaluating other cancers to determine if they are also inappropriately expressing hedgehog protein and therefore may be target cancers for hedgehog antibody therapy 
we are in discussions with several potential development partners for cancer applications of hedgehog antibody therapy 
hedgehog small molecule antagonist basal cell carcinoma program basal cell carcinoma bcc  the most common form of human cancer  is a cancer affecting the skin 
several years ago  it was discovered that almost all forms of bcc are caused by mutations in the hedgehog receptor complexes  which in turn results in unregulated activation of the hedgehog pathway 
although it is not typically life threatening  bcc can be significantly disfiguring due to the propensity for tumors to develop in sun accessible sites such as the face and hands 
currently  treatment for bcc usually involves surgical excision 
our scientists have discovered small molecule inhibitors of the hedgehog pathway that in animal models of bcc cause regression of established tumors and prevent development of new tumors 
we believe that a drug based treatment for bcc could have a significant market advantage over current surgical treatment options 
we have developed one of the small molecule hedgehog inhibitors cur to the point of ind acceptance and are now seeking a partner with dermatological clinical expertise to complete the evaluation of human therapeutic safety and efficacy 
we believe that our small molecule hedgehog antagonists may also have therapeutic potential in the treatment of types of cancer other than bcc 
we are currently evaluating this therapeutic possibility for medulloblastoma the most common malignant brain tumor in children and other cancers 
hedgehog small molecule agonist alopecia program several years ago  our scientists showed that hedgehog protein could stimulate rapid hair regrowth when implanted under the skin of an animal 
more recently  other researchers have shown that the hedgehog gene when delivered with a virus  can stimulate rapid hair regrowth in animals that had lost hair due to chemotherapy treatment 
our scientists have recently demonstrated that one of our small molecule hedgehog agonists can induce hair regrowth in an animal model 
we are currently evaluating the therapeutic potential of small molecule hedgehog agonists to promote hair regrowth in other models of age induced alopecia and chemotherapy induced alopecia 
other programs pyy peptide obesity program pyy is a gut peptide that has been shown in animals and humans to suppress appetite and reduce food intake 
several years prior to these results  our scientists working in the field of diabetes filed patent applications on the potential utility of using pyy as a treatment for certain metabolic disorders  including obesity 
in december of  we licensed our pyy patent applications to amylin in exchange for an up front fee  milestone payments upon the achievement of certain development objectives  and royalties on potential future product sales 
amylin has extensive development experience with other similar gut peptides 
amylin has exclusive responsibility for expenses related to further development of the pyy compound and has recently announced that it expects to file an ind on pyy for an obesity indication in stem cells diabetes program for several years  we have been evaluating the potential of using adult derived stem cells as a therapy to treat diabetes 
we successfully demonstrated the rescue of diabetic animals using proprietary methods which convert adult stem cells into insulin producing cells 
recently  we have decided that this program would be best developed by partnering it with a company that specializes in stem cell based therapeutics 
in december  we assigned and licensed our patent rights related to the development of cellular therapeutics for the treatment of diabetes to es cell in exchange for an up front fee and an equity position in es cell 
es cell is a singapore based company that develops stem cells as therapeutic products for various human disorders 
as part of the transaction  es cell will assume all responsibility and expense for future development and clinical testing of our diabetes stem cell technologies 
strategic alliances and license agreements our strategy for development and commercialization of products depends upon successful strategic alliances with third parties 
we look to strategic alliances as a means to provide us with the requisite capital  as well as the necessary preclinical and clinical development and manufacturing and marketing capabilities to commercialize product candidates produced by our discovery and preclinical programs 
in evaluating possible strategic alliances  we consider the following criteria the technical and commercial resources that a potential partner will commit to our programs  up front payments in the form of license fees and equity investments  royalties and milestone payments  technology and patent rights  and scientific and development resources 
we may not be able to establish new strategic alliances necessary to develop and commercialize our product candidates and any future arrangements may not be on terms favorable to us 
we cannot predict whether current or future strategic alliances will be successful 
we are currently seeking partners for our hedgehog antibody cancer program and our hedgehog small molecule antagonist basal cell carcinoma program 
our current strategic alliances are described below 
ortho biotech a subsidiary of johnson johnson we licensed our broad bmp technology portfolio to ortho biotech for all non orthopaedic therapeutic applications in november of in exchange for a  up front fee  a series of cash milestones if certain research objectives are achieved including a  milestone payment upon us regulatory approval of a product for the treatment of kidney disease  and a royalty on potential future product sales 
if the program progresses successfully through clinical development  we would receive additional milestone payments for the kidney disease related product candidate and milestone payments for the first neurology product candidate 
we are unable to disclose additional financial terms of the strategic alliance based on the confidentiality obligation of our agreement with ortho biotech 
initial target indications include prevention of bone and blood vessel complications associated with chronic kidney disease and treatments to promote recovery following stroke and brain injury 
elan corporation  plc we formed a joint venture  curis newco  ltd  with affiliates of elan in july of for the development of protein and small molecule modulators of the hedgehog signaling pathway intended for the treatment of neurological disorders including parkinson s disease and diabetic neuropathy 
the arrangement with elan covers the use of both hedgehog protein and hedgehog small molecule agonists 
upon formation of curis newco  elan international services  ltd 
eis  an affiliate of elan  purchased  of our common stock at per share 
additionally  elan pharma international  ltd 
epil  another affiliate of elan  agreed to loans  subject to epil s continuing consent  to allow payment for our share of curis newco s operating expenses 
each loan is being made under an  line of credit made available to us by epil and is evidenced by a convertible promissory note issued by us 
we have funded our share of curis newco expenses through september  using the line of credit  which has an outstanding balance of  as of february  under the terms of the joint venture arrangement  elan is responsible for a portion of curis newco expenses 
future funding of the curis newco development program  both in terms of loans and direct reimbursement of expenses  is contingent upon various factors  including consent by epil to continued loans and consensus between the parties on future development plans 
amylin pharmaceuticals in december of  we licensed our pyy patent applications to amylin pharmaceuticals in exchange for an up front fee  milestone payments if specified research objectives are achieved  and a royalty on potential future product sales 
amylin has sole responsibility for all further development of the pyy compound and has recently announced that it may file an ind on pyy for an obesity indication in es cell international pte ltd 
in december of  we assigned and licensed our patent rights related to the development of cellular therapeutics for the treatment of diabetes to es cell international pte  ltd 
in exchange for an up front fee and an equity position in es cell 
as part of the overall transaction  es cell will assume all responsibility for future development and clinical testing of our diabetes stem cell technologies  including funding all costs of six of our scientists through december  micromet ag in  we entered into three agreements with micromet ag including i a purchase and sale agreement pursuant to which we assigned our single chain polypeptide technology to micromet in exchange for certain consideration  ii a product development agreement and iii a target research and license agreement 
under these agreements  we are entitled to receive royalties on micromet s revenues  if any  arising out of the assigned technology  rights to jointly develop and commercialize future product discoveries  if any  arising out of the product development agreement  and access to other technologies 
the product development agreement provides us with the right  but not the obligation  to jointly fund research to develop antibodies against up to four potential targets through the proof of principle stage 
we will also have the right  but not the obligation  to jointly fund the development of two such antibody targets from the proof of principle stage through the completion of phase i clinical trials 
academic collaborations we have relationships with a number of academic institutions and investigators that are focused on areas of interest to us  including morphogenic proteins and tissue repair and regeneration in certain disease models 
in these collaborations  we seek to expand our scientific knowledge concerning internal research programs as well as the activities and characteristics of various proteins and small molecules under development by our scientists 
the academic collaborators are not our employees 
as a result  we have limited control over their activities and limited amounts of their time are dedicated to our projects 
from time to time  academic collaborators have relationships with other commercial entities  some of which may be competitors of ours 
although the precise nature of each relationship varies  the collaborators and their primary affiliated institutions generally sign agreements that provide for confidentiality of our proprietary technology and results of studies 
we seek to obtain exclusive rights to license developments that may result from these studies  however  there is no guarantee that such licenses can be obtained or that any associated royalties will permit effective commercialization of such developments 
competition the product candidates that we are developing would compete with existing and new products being developed by others for treatment of the same indications 
competition in the development of human therapeutics is particularly intense and includes many large pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies  as well as specialized biotechnology and medical device firms 
many of these companies have extensive financial  marketing and human resource capacities  which may result in significant competitive advantages 
others have extensive experience in undertaking clinical trials  in obtaining regulatory approval to market products and in manufacturing products on a large scale  which may enhance their competitive position 
in addition to competing with pharmaceutical  biotechnology and medical device companies  the products we are developing would also compete with those being developed by academic and research institutions  government agencies and other public organizations 
any of these organizations may discover new therapies  seek patent protection or establish collaborative arrangements for products and technologies which are competitive with our products and technologies 
the technology underlying the development of human therapeutic products is expected to continue to undergo rapid and significant advancement and change 
in the future  our technological and commercial success will be based on our ability to develop proprietary positions in key scientific areas and efficiently evaluate potential product opportunities 
the timing of a product s introduction may be a major factor in determining eventual commercial success and profitability 
early entry may have important advantages in gaining product acceptance and market share 
accordingly  we believe the relative speed with which we or our collaborative partners can complete preclinical and clinical testing  obtain regulatory approvals  and supply commercial quantities of a product will have an important impact on our competitive position  both in the united states and abroad 
other companies may succeed in developing similar products that are introduced earlier  are more effective  or are produced and marketed more effectively 
if research and development by others renders any of our products obsolete or noncompetitive  then our potential for success and profitability may be adversely affected 
research in the field of signaling pathways is highly competitive 
competitors include  among others  amgen  inc  chiron corporation  exelixis  inc  genentech  inc  geron corporation  and regeneron corporation  as well as other private companies and major pharmaceutical companies 
we also compete with universities and other research institutions  including those receiving federal government funding 
our competitors may discover  characterize and develop important inducing molecules or genes before we do  which could have a material adverse effect on any of our related research programs 
we rely on or will rely on our strategic partners for support in our disease research programs and for preclinical evaluation and clinical development of our potential products and manufacturing and marketing of any products 
some of our strategic partners are conducting multiple product development efforts within each disease area that is the subject of our strategic alliance with them 
our strategic alliance agreements may not restrict the strategic partner from pursuing competing internal development efforts 
any of our product candidates  therefore  may be subject to competition with a product candidate under development by a strategic partner 
patents and proprietary rights our ability to commercialize products and compete effectively with other companies will depend  in part  on our ability to maintain proprietary rights to our products and technology 
we currently own or have rights to approximately issued and pending patent applications in the united states and have foreign counterpart patent filings for most of these patents and patent applications 
these patents and patent applications are directed to compositions of matter  methods of making and using these compositions  methods of repairing  replacing  augmenting and creating tissue for multiple applications  methods for drug screening and discovery  developmental biological processes  and patents relating to our proprietary technologies 
the patent positions of pharmaceutical  biopharmaceutical  and biotechnology companies  including ours  are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions 
our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents and we may not successfully develop additional proprietary technologies or products that are patentable 
furthermore  our patents or those of our collaborative partners may not provide a basis for commercially viable products or provide us with any competitive advantages and may be challenged by third parties 
the patents of others could have an adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business 
our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain marketing exclusivity for our products for a period of time sufficient to establish a market position and achieve an adequate return on our investment in product development 
we believe that protection of our products and technology under united states and international patent laws and other intellectual property laws is an important factor in securing such market exclusivity 
although we pursue patent protection for our technology  significant legal issues remain as to the extent to which patent protection may be afforded in the field of biotechnology  in both the united states and foreign countries 
furthermore  the scope of protection has not yet been broadly tested 
therefore  we also rely upon trade secrets  know how and continuing technological advancement to develop and maintain our competitive position 
disclosure of our know how is generally protected under confidentiality agreements 
we do not know  however  whether all of our confidentiality agreements will be honored 
moreover  third parties could develop equivalent technology independently  and disputes could also arise as to the ownership of technical information or wrongful disclosure of our trade secrets 
our academic and research institution collaborators have certain rights to publish data and information regarding their discoveries to which we have rights 
while we believe that the limitations on publication of data developed by our collaborators pursuant to our collaboration agreements will be sufficient to permit us to apply for patent protection in the areas in which we are interested in pursuing further research  there is considerable pressure on such institutions to publish discoveries in the genetics and genomics fields 
any such publication could affect our ability to obtain patent protection in the areas in which we may have an interest 
we are party to various license agreements that give us rights to commercialize various technologies and to use technologies in our research and development processes 
the consideration payable in exchange for these licenses include up front fees  issuances of shares of common stock  annual royalties  milestone payments and running royalties on net sales by us and our sub licensees 
the licensors may terminate these agreements if we fail to meet certain diligence requirements  fail to make payments or otherwise commit a material breach that is not cured after notice 
others may have filed  and in the future are likely to file  patent applications covering molecules  genes or gene products that are similar or identical to our technologies or products 
these third party patent applications may have priority over patent applications filed by us 
any legal action against us or our strategic partners claiming damages and seeking to enjoin commercial activities relating to the affected products and processes could  in addition to subjecting us to potential liability for damages  require us or our strategic alliance partners to obtain a license in order to continue to manufacture or market the affected products and processes 
we or our strategic alliance partners may not prevail in any such action and any license required under any such patent may not be made available upon commercially acceptable terms  or at all 
litigation  which could result in substantial costs to us  may be necessary to enforce any patents issued or licensed to us or to determine the scope and validity of third party proprietary rights 
some of our competitors have  or are affiliated with companies having  substantially greater resources than we have  and such competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation to a greater degree and for longer periods of time than us 
manufacturing we have no experience or capabilities in large scale commercial manufacturing of protein and small molecule products 
we do not currently have any commercial manufacturing operations in house and do not have a qualified cgmp commercial manufacturing facility for any of our products 
we have no current plans to develop manufacturing capability and instead plan to rely on our corporate partners or subcontractors to manufacture products 
sales and marketing we have no sales  marketing and distribution experience or infrastructure and we have no current plans to develop a sales  marketing and distribution capability 
we plan to rely on our corporate partners for product sales  marketing and distribution 
regulatory matters regulation by governmental agencies in the united states and other countries is a significant factor in the clinical evaluation and licensing of our product candidates as well as in the development and research of new products 
all of our product candidates currently under development will require regulatory approval by the fda under the food  drug  and cosmetic act  as drugs or devices  or under the public health service act  as biologicals  before they can be marketed in the united states and by similar foreign governmental agencies before they can be marketed outside the united states 
regardless of the classifications assigned to our product candidates  all human diagnostic and therapeutic products are subject to rigorous testing to demonstrate their safety and efficacy 
generally  considerable time and expense are required to demonstrate safety and efficacy for use in humans of a new product candidate 
this process includes the time and expense of designing acceptable clinical trials  enrolling patients  and clinically evaluating the safety and efficacy data resulting from the clinical trials 
moreover  even after extensive preclinical testing  unanticipated side effects can arise during clinical trials and in the course of related or unrelated research within or outside our control that can halt or substantially delay the regulatory process 
seeking and obtaining regulatory approval for a new therapeutic or diagnostic product candidate is likely to take several years and require the expenditure of substantial resources 
we cannot predict whether any product candidate that enters preclinical or clinical development will be approved for sale by the fda or any other regulatory authorities 
products like ours developed through genetic engineering are relatively new  and therefore may become the subject of increased regulation  as genetically engineered products become more common 
the federal government oversees certain recombinant dna research activity through the national institutes of health nih guidelines for research involving recombinant dna molecules  known as the nih guidelines 
we believe that our activities comply with the nih guidelines 
discussions have been underway since between the nih and the fda regarding alternative models for regulation of recombinant dna research and the products resulting from such research  and the appropriateness of any continued nih role 
it is not possible to predict the effect of such potential regulatory changes on our business or our potential competitors 
our ability to conduct preclinical research is also subject to new and evolving regulations governing the use of human and embryonic tissues for isolating new growth factors and genes which may be useful in identifying and developing new therapeutic product candidates 
our ability to conduct critical research on which our development activities are based could be restricted or delayed depending on the outcome of pending rulemaking proceedings governing the use of these tissues and the collection of related genetic information 
pharmaceutical and biological products we expect that certain of our product candidates will be regulated by the fda or other regulatory authorities as pharmaceuticals or biologicals 
in the united states  the regulatory approval process for pharmaceutical and biological products intended for therapeutic use in humans involves several phases 
similar requirements are imposed by the regulatory authorities in other major market countries 
clinical testing to demonstrate safety and efficacy of a product candidate usually occurs in three phases phase i clinical trials test the safety and tolerance of the product candidate with a small group of subjects and may also yield preliminary information about the efficacy and dosage levels of the product  phase ii clinical trials test efficacy  determine optimal dosage and identify possible side effects in a larger patient group  and phase iii clinical trials continue to test for efficacy and safety in an expanded patient group 
after product approval  the fda may request or require an additional phase phase iv of clinical studies to provide further information on safety and or efficacy 
employees as of february   we had full time employees  of whom hold phd or other advanced degrees 
of these employees are currently involved in research and development 
none of our employees is a party to a collective bargaining agreement  and we consider our relations with our employees to be good 
item properties we have three facilities which are located at  and moulton street in cambridge  massachusetts and which consist of   and  square feet  respectively 
all of these facilities are leased until april we have sublet approximately  square feet at our moulton street location for a period of months beginning march  in addition  we have sublet  square feet at our moulton street location for an initial term of months beginning on august   with an option  at the subtenant s discretion  to extend the term for an additional two years and eight months 
we currently use all of our available space  other than that which we have subleased  to conduct our research and development initiatives and to manage the administrative aspects of our business 
we believe that our facilities will be adequate through at least the end of item legal proceedings other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business  there are no material legal proceedings pending to which we are a party or of which our property is the subject 
to our knowledge  no material legal proceeding is being contemplated by any third party or governmental authority

overview curis is a therapeutic drug development company 
our technology focus is on regulatory signaling pathways that control repair and regeneration of human tissue and organs 
our product development approach involves using proteins or small molecules to modulate these regulatory signaling pathways  for example  to increase the pathway signals when they are insufficient or to decrease them when they excessive 
we have successfully used this product development approach to produce several promising drug product candidates in the fields of kidney disease  neurological disorders  cancer and hair regrowth 
our mission is to discover and develop novel therapeutic drugs to treat diseases and disorders for which there are no adequate therapies or for which a new drug would represent a significant advancement over the current therapy 
we seek new medicines to improve the overall state of human health while at the same time striving to give our shareholders a return on their investment reflective of the risks associated with pharmaceutical drug development 
in february of  we completed a realignment of our research and development programs and a re focusing of our resources on our proprietary signaling pathways  particularly the bone morphogenic protein bmp and hedgehog hh families of product candidates 
as part of the realignment  we terminated our cell therapy clinical programs  reduced our workforce by people  incurred cash expenses of  and non cash expenses of  and terminated a lease on a  square foot development and manufacturing facility 
in december  we further reduced our workforce by employees for the purpose of reducing our cash burn 
since completing the realignment of our business in  we are now seeking to maximize the potential returns on our remaining assets  particularly in regulatory signaling pathways 
because we are a small company with limited human and financial resources  we believe that the best way to advance many of our scientific programs is through the establishment of corporate collaborations with pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies that possess the financial resources and or specific areas of expertise ie  clinical and regulatory development to push product candidates toward commercialization 
we have recently completed business transactions with ortho biotech  es cell  and amylin relating to our bmp  diabetes cellular therapy and pyy peptide technologies  respectively 
in  we entered into collaborations with elan and micromet relating to the hedgehog signaling pathway for neurological indications and our single chain antibody technologies  respectively 
in the future  we plan to continue to seek corporate partners for certain technologies including our hedgehog antibody cancer program and our hedgehog small molecule antagonist basal cell carcinoma program  however  we may not be successful in our efforts to enter into new partnerships  and our existing partnerships may not successful 
even though we are seeking partners to help develop some of our technologies  we expect to select at least one program in that we will develop further on our own 
our selection of a program will be based on a number of factors including the time  expense and complexity of clinical trials that we estimate will be required for approval 
we are considering whether the hedgehog small molecule agonist alopecia program may be a good program to develop further without a partner 
strategic alliances to date  our research and development contract and license fee revenues have been generated from agreements with collaborative partners 
over the next few years  we anticipate deriving most of our revenues from existing collaboration and additional collaboration agreements which we may enter into in the future 
we may not be able to find suitable partners willing to form collaborations on terms we consider acceptable  or at all 
failure to form such collaborations would adversely affect our future research and development contract revenues 
on october   we completed a transaction with stryker  under the terms of which stryker paid us  in cash in exchange for the termination of stryker s future bmp op royalty obligations 
in addition to this cash payment of the estimated net present value of our potential bmp op royalty stream  this transaction allowed us to reduce future bmp royalties that we would owe to stryker for products sold in therapeutic indications other than orthopedics and dental  if any sales ever occur 
we recorded the  cash payment as revenue during the fourth quarter of we will receive no future royalties or payments of any other kind from stryker as a result of this transaction 
since january of  we have entered into three collaborations  including i a license agreement with ortho biotech involving our broad bmp portfolio for all non orthopaedic therapeutic applications  ii a license agreement with amylin for our pyy patent applications  and iii assignment and license agreements with es cell related to our patent rights for the development of cellular therapeutics for the treatment of diabetes 
in addition  in an effort to increase our focus on signaling pathway technologies and to reduce our cash burn rate  we terminated a sponsored research agreement with aegera therapeutics  inc under which we were obligated to fund aegera scientists at a rate of  per year 
the aegera collaboration was established in january and involved research in skin derived  adult stem cell technologies 
we were awarded  of government grants from the national institute of standards and technology nist 
these grants were to be received over the period ending on december  we discontinued our work on the programs covered by these nist grants as part of our business realignment 
as a result  on april   these awards were terminated 
future operating results will depend largely on the magnitude of payments from our current and potential future corporate partners and the outcome of other product candidates currently in our research and development pipeline 
we cannot be sure of either the timing and amount of these payments or the likelihood of successful outcomes for products currently in our pipeline 
we have never been profitable and we expect to incur additional operating losses in the next several years 
the results of our operations will vary significantly from year to year and quarter to quarter and depend on  among other factors  the timing of our entry into new collaborations and the timing of the receipt of payments from collaborators and the cost and outcome of clinical trials 
we believe that our existing capital resources should enable us to maintain current and planned operations into the first quarter of critical accounting policies in december of  the securities and exchange commission requested that all registrants list their most critical accounting policies in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the sec indicated that a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
while our significant accounting policies are fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this annual report on form k  we believe that the following accounting policies are critical long lived assets 
long lived assets consist of goodwill  a long term note receivable from micromet  equity securities held in certain of our strategic alliance partners  capitalized patent costs  and long term deposits 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles and long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
if it were determined that the carrying value of intangible or long lived assets might not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment  we would measure any impairment based on a projected cash flow method 
as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
 effective january   we ceased amortization of goodwill 
in lieu of amortization  we performed an initial assessment of impairment of our goodwill in the first quarter of this initial assessment involved comparing the fair value of the company to the net assets of the company 
we determined our fair value based on quoted market prices adjusted to provide for a control premium 
the fair value of the company was in excess of the company s net assets and  therefore  we concluded that our goodwill was not impaired 
sfas no 
requires us to perform an impairment assessment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that our goodwill may be impaired 
we concluded that the decline in our market capitalization during the three month period ended june  indicated that the carrying value of goodwill might be impaired 
as a result  we conducted an impairment assessment as required under sfas no 
by comparing our fair value to our net assets  including goodwill  as of june  because the carrying value of our net assets exceeded our fair value at june   we determined that our goodwill had been impaired 
to determine the amount of the impairment charge  we calculated our implied goodwill as the difference between our fair value and the fair value of our assets and liabilities 
the fair value of our intangible assets  principally consisting of completed and in process technology  was estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology 
based on this valuation  we determined that our implied goodwill was  and we recorded a non cash charge of approximately  to write down our existing goodwill 
this charge is included in operating costs and expenses within our statements of operations for the year ended december  the goodwill impairment analysis involves considerable judgment and the use of several estimates including control premium  discount rates  projected cash flows of op  and projected cash flows of our in process research and development programs 
the control premium used in determining our fair value was based on an analysis of control premiums involved in other biotechnology and medical products acquisitions 
most of our research and development programs will not be completed for several years  if ever  and therefore estimating the costs to complete these programs and the revenue to be derived through collaborations and commercialization of the products involves substantial judgment 
the discount rates used to determine the net present value of these cash flows was based on a consideration of the risks associated with achieving these cash flow projections  including the risk of successfully completing our in process technology 
all of these estimates involve a significant amount of judgment by our management 
although the estimates used reflect management s best estimates based upon all available evidence  the use of different estimates could have yielded different results in our transitional impairment assessment conducted as of january  and in our impairment assessment conducted in the second quarter of had we used a significantly lower control premium in determining the fair value of the company  our transitional impairment analysis could have indicated that goodwill was impaired at january  in addition  using different estimated cash flows or discount rates in determining our implied goodwill in the second quarter of could have resulted in a higher or lower goodwill impairment charge 
during the year ended december   we recorded impairment charges of property and equipment assets related to our business realignment of approximately  these charges relate to impairment on assets at our former manufacturing and development facility located at erie street in cambridge  massachusetts 
 of the total impairment charge relates to the write off of tenant improvements made to the erie street facility since such improvements are affixed to the facility and therefore cannot be sold separately from the facility 
the remaining charge of  was to write down equipment to its estimated salvage value 
the amount we received from the sale of these assets was not significantly different from the originally estimated fair value 
during the third quarter of the year ended december   we recorded an impairment charge of approximately  to reduce the carrying value of patents determined not to be beneficial or not expected to be utilized in future operations and which have no alternative future use 
revenue recognition 
our revenue recognition policy is critical because revenue is a key component of our results of operations 
we follow the provisions of the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
sab no 
 revenue recognition 
in accordance with sab no 
 we recognize revenue related to research activities as they are performed  so long as there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of the related receivable is probable 
amounts received for license fees are deferred and recognized as services are performed over the performance period of the contract 
amounts received for milestones will be recognized upon achievement of the milestone as long as the milestone is deemed to be substantive and we have no other performance obligations 
in the event that we have remaining performance obligations  the portion of the milestone payment equal to the lesser of the non refundable cash received or the percentage of the services performed through that date multiplied by the total milestone payment would be recognized as revenue 
the percentage of services performed is based on the ratio of the number of direct labor hours performed to date to total direct labor hours that we are obligated to perform under the related contract  as determined on a full time equivalent basis 
the remainder  if any  will be recognized proportionately as the remaining services are performed 
for the year ended december   we recognized  of revenues relating to research and development services performed under our corporate collaboration agreements 
we have not recognized any revenue under such agreements during the years ended december  and royalty revenue is recognized upon the sale of the related products  provided the royalty amounts are fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
amounts received prior to satisfying the above revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying balance sheets 
amounts not expected to be recognized during the year ended december  are classified as long term deferred revenue 
as of december   we have recorded long term deferred revenue of approximately  related to the micromet see note d to our consolidated financial statements multiple element arrangement and short term revenue of approximately  related to our collaboration with es cell see note e to our consolidated financial statements 
government grant revenues consist of grant awards from the department of health and human services and the nist see note 
revenue is recognized under government grants as the services are provided and payment is assured under the terms of the grant 
we follow detailed guidelines in measuring revenue  however  certain judgments affect the application of our revenue policy 
for example  we entered into purchase and sale  product development and target research agreements with micromet  under which we recorded on our balance sheet short and long term deferred revenue based on our best estimate of when such revenue will be recognized 
a portion of the consideration received from this transaction with micromet was equity securities and a convertible note 
the estimate of deferred revenue includes management s assessment of the value attributable to the equity securities and realization of the convertible note 
the up front payments received from micromet for the sale of technology will be recognized as revenue as services are performed over our estimated performance period under the product development agreement 
to date   has been recognized as revenue 
the above list is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which begin on page f which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting policies 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosure of certain assets and liabilities at our balance sheet date 
such estimates include the collectibility of receivables  the carrying value of property and equipment and intangible assets and the value of certain liabilities 
actual results may differ from such estimates 
examples of some of our significant estimates are as follows valuation of investments in privately held companies 
we have investments in aegera therapeutics  inc  micromet and es cell of   and  respectively 
these investments are included in the deposits and other assets category of our consolidated balance sheets 
at each balance sheet date  we review these investments to determine whether the fair value of these investments is less than the carrying value and  if so  whether we should write down the investment 
these companies are not publicly traded and  therefore  determining the fair value of our investments in these companies involves significant judgment 
we considered available information in estimating the fair value of these investments and  as of december   believe that the fair value of these investments is not less than their carrying value 
however  if the financial condition or results of these companies declines significantly  the fair value of these investments would likely decline and  as a result  we may have to record an impairment charge to the extent such impairment is deemed other than temporary 
collectibility of long term note receivable 
as of december   we have a note receivable from micromet totaling  including accrued interest of  this amount is presented as deposits and other assets in our consolidated balance sheets 
payment of this note is not due until the earlier of the closing of an initial public offering by micromet or june  as of december   we believe this note is fully collectible and  therefore  we have not recorded a reserve against this balance 
if micromet s financial condition declines  some or all of this note could become uncollectible and  as a result  we would have to record a reserve for some or all of the note 
timing of deferred revenue recognition 
the company has recorded short term deferred revenue of  and long term deferred revenue of  as of december  short term deferred revenue consists of amounts not expected to be recognized as revenue during the year ended december  however  this estimate is based on the company s current operating plan as of december  if this operating plan should change during  a different amount of deferred revenue may be recognized by the company for the year ended december  results of operations on july   creative biomolecules  inc  ontogeny  inc 
and reprogenesis  inc merged with and into curis pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger dated as of february  as a result of the merger  the consolidated statement of operations data for the year ended december  include the operating results of creative for the seven months ended july  and our operating results  comprising the combined operations of creative  ontogeny and reprogenesis  for the five months ended december  the consolidated statement of operations data for the years ended december  and include only our operating expenses for such periods 
accordingly  comparisons of operating expenses between the and the periods presented below may not prove to be meaningful 
additionally  in the year ended december   we and creative incurred significant non cash charges associated with the merger and cash expenses for merger related fees and expenses 
years ended december  and revenues total revenues for the year ended december  were  as compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in revenues was primarily attributable to the consummation in of various corporate collaboration transactions 
research and development contract and government grant revenue decreased by  or  to  for the year ended december  compared to a  for the year ended december  the research and development contract and government grant revenue for the year ended december  was derived entirely from revenue recognized under corporate collaborations 
for the year ended december   this revenue was derived solely from government grants 
license fees and royalty revenue increased by  to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to the recognition of revenue upon the completion of various transactions in including i  in revenue recognized under a transaction with stryker  under which we sold our rights to future royalties from stryker on sales of op  ii  in revenue recognized from an up front payment received by us in connection with the licensing of certain of our bmp technology to ortho biotech  a member of the johnson johnson family of companies  and iii  recognized under other transactions completed in in addition  royalty revenue received in from stryker on sales of op increased by  to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  as part of the stryker transaction  we will receive no future royalties on sales by stryker of op operating expenses research and development expenses decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in ongoing operating costs as a result of the february realignment of our research and development programs and a re focusing of our resources on our proprietary signaling pathways and stem cell technologies  including the bone morphogenic protein and the hedgehog family of product candidates 
in addition  our allocation of research and development expenses to curis newco increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  our share of these costs is included in equity in loss from joint venture in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  include the cost of employees involved in research and development of  outside services including medicinal chemistry  consulting and sponsored research collaborations of  occupancy and depreciation charges of  lab supplies of  and legal fees associated with our intellectual property of  research and development expenses for the year ended december  are net of  in expenses that were charged by us to curis newco  however  of these costs are included as part of equity in loss from joint venture in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  include the cost of employees involved in research and development of  outside services including clinical trials  medicinal chemistry  consulting and sponsored research collaborations of  occupancy and depreciation charges of  lab and clinical trial manufacturing supplies of  and legal fees associated with our intellectual property of  research and development expenses for the year ended december  are net of  in expenses that were charged by us to curis newco 
however  of these costs are included as part of equity in loss from joint venture in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss 
general and administrative expenses decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in ongoing operating costs as a result of our business realignment 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  include the costs of employees of  occupancy and depreciation charges of  professional service fees and other outside services including legal costs and consultants of  and a charge to record a reserve for possible non collection of notes receivable outstanding to two former officers of creative of  this charge is based on the total book value of the notes receivable less the underlying value of our common stock that secures the notes receivable 
the book value of these notes receivable was  and  as of december  and  and is included as notes receivable at the stockholders equity section of our consolidated balance sheets 
the reserve on the notes receivable was  and  as of december  and  and is included as part of accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  include the costs of employees of  occupancy and depreciation charges of  professional service fees and other outside services including legal costs and consultants of  and a charge to record a reserve for possible non collection of notes receivable outstanding to two former officers of creative of  this charge is based on the total book value of the outstanding obligation due from the former creative officers less the underlying value of our common stock that secures the notes receivable 
the book value of the notes receivable was  as of december   and is included as notes receivable at the stockholders equity section of our consolidated balance sheet 
the reserve on the notes receivable was  as of december   and is included in accrued liabilities at our consolidated balance sheet 
stock based compensation decreased by  or  to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily attributable to the stock based compensation expense related to deferred compensation resulting from the merger that was amortized over the vesting period of the underlying options through august  stock based compensation related to these options was approximately  for the year ended december  in addition  there was a decrease in the amount of stock based compensation expense related to our issuance on august  of stock options with exercise prices below fair market value 
because these options were issued with exercise prices below fair market value  we recorded deferred compensation and have been amortizing the deferred compensation over the four year vesting period of the options 
when an option holder s employment with us is terminated  we treat any unvested portion of their options and related deferred compensation as charged to the additional paid in capital accounts not the stock based compensation accounts 
accordingly  the departure of four officers and approximately other employees as a result of the realignment of our business and a subsequent staff reduction in december has resulted in a decrease of stock based compensation expense  since the remaining deferred compensation balance associated with each terminated employees august  stock options was immediately charged to additional paid in capital instead of to stock based compensation 
amortization of intangible assets decreased by  or  to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to the adoption of sfas  which required companies to stop amortizing goodwill and certain other intangible assets 
we are currently amortizing only capitalized patent and technology costs 
amortization of goodwill totaling  was recorded for the year ended december  loss on property and equipment for the year ended december  of approximately  related to impairment on assets at our facility at erie street in cambridge  massachusetts 
total carrying value of assets at the erie street facility before the impairment charge was approximately  the property and equipment assets at the erie street facility were used to support clinical programs that were suspended or terminated as part of the realignment and have been deemed to be unlikely to be used in our future operations 
 of the impairment charge related to the write off of tenant improvements made to the erie street facility since such improvements were affixed to the facility and therefore could not be sold separately from the facility 
the remaining  of impairment charge represents our estimate of loss on disposition of the furniture and equipment assets held at the erie street facility 
we do not expect to incur additional impairment on property and equipment related to the realignment in future periods 
impairment of goodwill for the year ended december  was  in accordance with sfas no 
 we concluded that the decline in our market capitalization during the three month period ended june  indicated that the carrying value of our goodwill may be impaired 
accordingly  we conducted an impairment review as required under sfas no 
as of june  and determined that goodwill impairment had occurred as of june  our value  as a single reporting unit  was calculated using quoted market prices adjusted to provide for a control premium 
in calculating the impairment charge  the fair value of our intangible assets  principally consisting of completed and in process technology  was estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology 
realignment expenses of  were recorded for the year ended december  these charges relate to i costs of approximately  associated with workforce reductions of people  including officers  ii costs of approximately  associated with the closing of clinical programs and decommissioning of a manufacturing and development facility and iii other costs of approximately  as of december   we have expended approximately all of the  in realignment expenses 
we do not expect to incur additional expenses in future periods 
equity in loss from joint venture equity in loss from joint venture decreased by  or  to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the equity in loss from joint venture relates to our joint venture with affiliates of elan corporation  plc 
the decrease is primarily caused by our  or  share of a  write off of technology recorded by the joint venture in july this decrease was partially offset by an increase in our share of ongoing operating expenses recorded by the joint venture for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the increase in ongoing operating expenses for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was primarily caused by the joint venture operating for twelve months in versus five months in other income expenses for the year ended december   interest income was  as compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or 
the decrease in interest income resulted from a lower available investment balance and lower average investment yields for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  for the year ended december   other income was  as compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or 
this decrease was principally due to a decrease in the amount of gain recognized on sales of exelixis  inc common stock 
we recognized gains of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  related to sales of exelixis  inc common stock 
the decrease in the gain recognized on sales of exelixis common stock was partially offset by an increase in the gain recognized on currency rate fluctuations on a euro denominated long term note receivable issued to us by micromet in connection with our strategic alliance 
we recognized gains on currency rate fluctuations of  and  respectively  for the years ended december  and for the year ended december   interest expense was  as compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of  or 
the increase in interest expense resulted partially from the increase in the amount that we owe to elan pharma international  ltd  an affiliate of elan  as part of our curis newco joint venture 
interest expense associated with the curis newco joint venture increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  in addition  we incurred  for the year ended december  in non cash interest expense related to a  convertible subordinated note payable issued to becton dickinson in june this represented a  increase over the  incurred for the year ended december  these increases were partially offset by a decrease in interest expense paid on capital leases in compared to accretion on series a convertible exchangeable preferred stock accretion on series a convertible exchangeable preferred stock increased by  or  to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this charge relates to the accretion of a mandatory dividend on shares of convertible exchangeable preferred stock issued to an affiliate of elan

revenues recognized from these sources totaled  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
license fees and royalties increased  to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in royalties was primarily due to an increase in royalty revenues received from stryker arising out of sales of op operating expenses research and development expenses increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to the consummation of the merger of creative  ontogeny and reprogenesis which occurred on july  research and development expenses for the year ended december  include the costs incurred by the combined companies for the entire twelve month period  whereas research and development expenses for the year ended december  include the costs incurred by only creative for the seven month period of january  to july  and the combined companies for the five month period from august  to december  this general increase based on the timing of the merger was offset in part by severance payments made by creative in the year ended december  research and development expenses for the year ended december  include the cost of employees involved in research and development of  outside services including clinical trials  medicinal chemistry  consulting and sponsored research collaborations of  occupancy and depreciation charges of  lab and clinical trial manufacturing supplies of  and legal fees associated with our intellectual property of  research and development expenses for the year ended december  are net of  in expenses that were charged by us to curis newco

general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  include the costs incurred by only creative for the seven month period of january  to july  and the combined companies for the five month period from august  to december  this general increase based on the timing of the merger was offset in part by severance payments made by creative in the year ended december  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  include the costs of employees of  occupancy and depreciation charges of  professional service fees and other outside services including legal costs and consultants of  and a charge to record a reserve for possible non collection of notes receivable outstanding to two former officers of creative of  this charge is based on the total book value of the notes receivable less the underlying value of our common stock that secures the notes receivable 
the book value of the notes receivable was  as of december   and is included as notes receivable at the stockholders equity section of our consolidated balance sheet 
the reserve on the notes receivable was  as of december   and is included in accrued liabilities at our consolidated balance sheet 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  include the costs of employees of  legal and professional fees of  and insurance expense of  in addition  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  include severance paid to former officers of creative of  and severance payments relating to the termination of approximately eight other employees totaling  stock based compensation decreased by  or  to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the decrease was partially due to two stock based compensation charges arising out of the merger that were recorded in the year ended december  including i  that was related to the acceleration of certain stock options and the extension of the exercise period for options held by creative s executive officers  outside directors and employees  and ii compensation expense of  based on the fair value of  shares of restricted common stock granted to a former reprogenesis executive officer that became fully vested upon the merger 
in addition  our amortization expense related to deferred compensation resulting from the merger  which was amortized over the vesting period of the underlying options through august   decreased to  in the year ended december  from  in the year ended december  these decreases in stock based compensation expenses related to the merger were partially offset by an increase in stock based compensation expense related to our issuance on august  of options to purchase  shares of our common stock with an exercise price below fair market value 
the resulting stock based compensation  net of terminations  of  is being amortized over the four year vesting period of the underlying stock options for options granted to employees and as earned for nonemployees in accordance with eitf the total deferred compensation expense related to these options was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
amortization of intangible assets increased by  or  to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the increase was principally due to the amortization of goodwill increasing to  from  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in the amortization of goodwill in was partially offset by an impairment charge in the year ended december  of approximately  to reduce the carrying value of certain capitalized patents determined not to be beneficial or expected to be utilized in future operations and which have no alternative future use 
fixed asset disposition charges totaling  were incurred during the year ended december  for the net book value of equipment disposed of as a result of the merger 
no such charges were incurred for the year ended december  a charge of  was incurred on july  resulting from that portion of the purchase price of ontogeny and reprogenesis that was identified as in process research and development 
the purchase price of ontogeny and reprogenesis was allocated to the assets acquired  including ipr d  based upon an independent appraisal  which used proven valuation tools and techniques 
equity in loss from joint venture during the year ended december   we formed a joint venture with affiliates of elan pharmaceuticals  plc 
in  we incurred an equity in loss from joint venture of  which represented of the total net loss incurred by the joint venture

this transaction reduces future bmp royalties that we would owe to stryker for products sold in therapeutic indications other than orthopaedics and dental  if any sales ever occur 
we recorded the  received as revenue during the fourth quarter of we will receive no future royalties or payments of any other kind from stryker as a result of this transaction 
on june   we entered into a loan agreement with boston private bank trust company pursuant to which we borrowed approximately  we used the proceeds of this loan to pay off our existing credit facility with fleet national bank 
under the terms of the loan agreement  we will i pay interest monthly in arrears at a variable interest rate at december   and ii repay principal in equal quarterly installments over a five year term  beginning on september  this loan is fully collateralized with a money market account maintained by us at boston private bank trust company 
the collateral is included in cash and cash equivalents restricted at our consolidated balance sheet as of december  as of december   there was approximately  including approximately  in accrued interest  outstanding under the loan agreement 
on july   we and elan international services  ltd  or eis  formed curis newco  an entity that is committed to the research and development of molecules that stimulate the hedgehog signaling pathway in the area of neurological disorders 
as part of the joint venture arrangement  we entered into an  convertible promissory note agreement with elan pharma international limited  or epil 
this note agreement bears interest at per annum through july  and per annum thereafter  compounded and payable semi annually 
our borrowings under this note agreement may only be used to meet our funding obligations for curis newco s development program 
as of december   there was approximately  including approximately  in capitalized interest  outstanding under the note agreement 
on june   we entered into a purchase and sale agreement with micromet  a german biotechnology corporation  pursuant to which we assigned our single chain polypeptide technology to micromet in exchange for  in cash received   shares of micromet common stock valued at approximately  and a convertible promissory note of eur  principal value of approximately  at december  
during the first quarter of  we entered into a target research and license agreement and a product development agreement with micromet 
these agreements will provide us with royalties on micromet s product revenues  if any  arising out of the assigned technology  rights to jointly develop and commercialize future product discoveries  if any  arising out of the product development agreement  and exclusive access by us to micromet s proprietary single cell analysis of gene expression technology in the field of stem cell research 
the product development agreement provides us the right but not the obligation to jointly fund research to develop antibiotics against up to four potential targets through the proof of principle stage 
we will also have the right  but not the obligation  to jointly fund the development of two such antibody targets from the proof of principle stage through the completion of phase i clinical trials 
lastly  we will be obligated to pay milestones to micromet upon the attainment of certain development goals 
on june   we received  from becton dickinson under a convertible subordinated note payable in connection with the exercise by becton dickinson of an option to negotiate a collaboration agreement 
the note is repayable at any time up to its maturity date of june  by us  at our discretion  in either cash or upon issuance to becton dickinson of shares of our common stock 
the note bears interest at 
we lease equipment under various capital lease arrangements 
monthly payments on leases outstanding as of december   range from to  and maturities range from january to july the initial terms of the leases range from months to months and bear interest at rates ranging from to 
as of december   approximately  was outstanding under these agreements and we were in compliance with all covenants under these agreements 
on october   we received our second  grant from nist to support the development of a new class of biomaterials designed to enable surgical procedures that augment  repair or regenerate lost structural tissue or physiological function 
the grant period is from january  to december  previously  reprogenesis had been awarded a  grant from nist to support the development of our cardiovascular products  vascugel and vascuject 
the grant period for the nist grant made to reprogenesis is from november  to october  the programs covered by these two nist awards were terminated as part of the realignment 
effective april   these awards were terminated and we will receive no future revenue under these awards 
as of december   we had future payments required under contractual obligations and other commitments approximately as follows amounts in s total debt obligations convertible subordinated long term debt capital lease obligations series a convertible exchangeable preferred stock operating lease obligations outside service obligations licensing obligations total future obligations convertible subordinated debt is convertible into either shares of our common stock or cash at our option 
the series a convertible exchangeable preferred stock preferred stock is  at the option an affiliate of elan  convertible into our common stock at any time from july  through july   at per share 
in addition  the preferred stock is exchangeable  at an affiliate of elan s option  for non voting preference shares of curis newco originally issued to us and representing of the aggregate outstanding shares of curis newco 
to the extent that there is still some portion of the preferred stock outstanding as of july   we must redeem the preferred stock in either i cash  ii by the issuance of common stock or iii any combination of i and ii 
the  disclosed in the above table assumes that all of the preferred stock is outstanding at july  and is redeemed in cash 
we anticipate that existing capital resources should enable us to maintain current and planned operations into the first quarter of we expect to incur substantial additional research and development and other costs  including costs related to preclinical studies and clinical trials for the foreseeable future 
our ability to continue funding planned operations beyond the first quarter of is dependent upon the success of our collaborations with our collaborative partners  our ability to continue to reduce our cash burn rate  and our ability to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings  or from other sources of financing 
our ability to generate sufficient cash flows depends on a number of factors  including the ability to obtain regulatory approval to market and commercialize products to treat indications in major commercial markets 
we are seeking additional collaborative arrangements and also expect to raise funds through one or more financing transactions  if conditions permit 
over the longer term  because of our significant long term capital requirements  we intend to seek to raise funds through the sale of debt or equity securities when conditions are favorable  even if we do not have an immediate need for additional capital at such time 
however  additional financing may not be available or  if available  it may not be available on favorable terms 
in addition  the sale of additional debt or equity securities could result in dilution to our stockholders 
if substantial additional funding is not available  our ability to fund research and development and other operations will be significantly affected and  accordingly  our business will be materially and adversely affected 
we have no off balance sheet arrangements as of december  new accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized at its fair market value when the liability is incurred  rather than at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
the provisions of sfas are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  the adoption of sfas has not had a material effect on our financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued fin guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  an interpretation of fasb statements no 
  and and rescission of fasb interpretation no 
fin requires that a guarantor recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken by issuing the guarantee 
the interpretation also requires additional disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees it has issued 
the accounting requirements for the initial recognition of guarantees are applicable on a prospective basis for guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements are effective for all guarantees outstanding  regardless of when they were issued or modified  during the first quarter of fiscal the adoption of fin did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation as originally provided by sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation 
additionally  sfas amends the disclosure requirements of sfas to require prominent disclosure in both the annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the transitional requirements of sfas will be effective for all financial statements for fiscal years ending after december  the disclosure requirements shall be effective for financial reports containing condensed financial statements for interim periods beginning after december  we expect to adopt the disclosure portion of this statement for the quarter ending march  the application of this standard will have no impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in january  the fasb issued fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
the primary objective of the interpretation is to provide guidance on the identification of  and financial reporting for  entities over which control is achieved through means other than voting rights 
such entities are known as variable interest entities vies 
although the fasb s initial focus was on special purpose entities spes  the final guidance applies to a wide range of entities 
fin applies to new entities that are created after the effective date  as well as applies to existing entities 
the fin is effective to preexisting entities as of the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june   and to any new entities beginning february  once it goes into effect  fin will be the guidance that determines whether consolidation is required under the controlling financial interest model of accounting research bulletin no 
arb  consolidated financial statements  or other existing authoritative guidance  or  alternatively  whether the variable interest model under fin should be used to account for existing and new entities 
we are evaluating the impact of fin on our financial statements 
risk factors investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk 
before making an investment decision  you should carefully consider the following information about these risks as well as other information we include or incorporate by reference in this annual report filed on form k 
the risks and uncertainties we have described are not the only ones facing us 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer  and you could lose all or part of your investment 
risks related to our business  industry  strategy and operations we sold our rights to future op royalties from stryker in october we have not commercialized any other products to date 
if we are not able to commercialize any other products  we will not be profitable 
on october   we sold our right to receive bmp op royalty revenues back to stryker corporation in exchange for  in cash 
while this transaction provided us with capital to pursue our other product opportunities  it eliminated our only ongoing product royalty revenue stream 
all but one of our other product opportunities  described more fully in item business section of this annual report filed on form k  are in various stages of preclinical development 
only our program for bcc has had an ind accepted 
an ind allows for human clinical trials to begin 
because our product opportunities have several years of development prior to reaching commercialization  there is a substantial risk that none of our current product opportunities will ever be commercialized 
if none our product opportunities are commercialized  we would not recognize any revenue and we would not be profitable 
we are dependent on collaborative partners for the development and commercialization of many of our products 
any failure or delay by these partners in developing or commercializing our products could eliminate significant portions of our anticipated product pipeline 
the success of our strategy for development and commercialization of product candidates depends upon our ability to form productive collaborations and strategic alliances 
because we are a small company with limited human and financial resources  we believe that the best way to advance many of our scientific programs is through the establishment of corporate collaborations with pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies that possess the financial resources and or specific areas of expertise ie  clinical and regulatory development which we currently do not possess 
we currently have strategic alliances with ortho biotech  products  lp a member of the johnson johnson family of companies  es cell international pte ltd  amylin pharmaceuticals  inc  micromet ag  elan corporation plc  and others 
if these strategic alliances are terminated or if none of the strategic alliances develop viable products  or if the products developed as a result of these alliances are not approved for commercial sale in the united states and or other markets around the world  our expected royalty revenues would be diminished and our business would be materially and adversely affected 
as an integral part of our ongoing research and development efforts  we periodically review opportunities to establish new collaborations  joint ventures and strategic alliances for the development and commercialization of products in our development pipeline 
in the coming year  we intend to enter into additional strategic alliances 
even if we determine that it would be advantageous to establish a new collaboration  joint venture  or strategic alliance to exploit a product candidate in our development pipeline  we may not be able to establish such an arrangement on terms that we find acceptable  or at all 
if we are unable to enter into new relationships to further our development efforts  we may be compelled to divert financing away from programs we consider promising 
by entering into strategic alliances to further our research program goals  we have relinquished a degree of control over the resources that our alliance partners dedicate to our research programs or the development schedule that they set in pursuit of our research goals and thereby may not be able to control the efforts that our alliance partners may devote to their respective programs with us 
the timing and amount of any future royalty and clinical development milestone revenues with respect to product sales and product development under such collaborative arrangements will therefore depend on the level of commitment  timing and success of such collaborative partners efforts 
accordingly  we cannot predict the success of current or future strategic alliances 
we rely on our collaborative partners for support in our disease research programs and intend to rely on our strategic partners for certain preclinical evaluation and clinical development of our potential products and manufacturing and marketing of any products 
some of our strategic partners are conducting multiple product development efforts within each disease area that is the subject of our strategic alliance with them 
our strategic alliance agreements may not restrict a strategic partner from pursuing competing internal development efforts 
any of our product candidates  therefore  may be subject to competition with a potential product under development by a strategic partner 
also  our partners may fail to perform their obligations under the strategic alliances or may be slow in performing their obligations 
our partners may terminate our strategic alliances under certain conditions 
if any collaborative partner were to terminate or breach an agreement  or otherwise fail to complete its obligations in a timely manner  our anticipated revenue  if any  from the agreement and from the development and commercialization of our products under development which are the subject of the agreement could be severely limited 
furthermore  if any of our existing strategic alliances are terminated and we are not able to enter into alternative strategic alliances on acceptable terms  we may be required to undertake product development  manufacturing and commercialization and we may not have the funds or capability to do this  which could result in a discontinuation of such program 
we face substantial competition  which may result in our competitors discovering  developing or commercializing products before or more successfully than we do 
the product candidates currently in our development pipeline may face competition with existing and new products being developed by biotechnology  medical device and pharmaceutical companies  as well as universities and other research institutions 
many of our competitors have substantially greater capital resources  research and development staffs and facilities than we have 
efforts by other biotechnology  medical device and pharmaceutical companies could render our programs or products uneconomical or result in therapies superior to those that we develop 
furthermore  many of our competitors are more experienced in product development and commercialization  obtaining regulatory approvals and product manufacturing 
as a result  they may develop competing products more rapidly and at a lower cost 
these competitors may discover  develop and commercialize products which render the products that we or our collaborative partners are seeking to develop and commercialize non competitive or obsolete 
research in the fields of regulatory signaling pathways and functional genomics  which includes our work in oncology and renal disease  is highly competitive 
our primary competitors in the field of regulatory signaling pathways include amgen  inc  chiron corporation  exelixis  inc  genentech  inc and geron corporation 
our primary competitors in the field of functional genomics include axys pharmaceuticals  inc  genome therapeutics corporation  human genome sciences  inc  incyte pharmaceuticals  inc  millennium pharmaceuticals  inc and myriad genetics  inc 
we also compete with universities and other research institutions  including those receiving financial support from the federally funded human genome project 
a number of entities are seeking to identify and patent randomly sequenced genes and gene fragments  typically without specific knowledge of the function that such genes or gene fragments perform 
our competitors may discover  characterize and develop important inducing molecules or genes in advance of us 
we also face competition from these and other entities in gaining access to dna samples used in our research and development projects 
we expect competition to intensify in genomics research and regulatory signaling pathways as technical advances in the field are made and become more widely known 
since our technologies have many potential applications and we have limited resources  our election to focus on a particular application may result in our failure to capitalize on other potentially profitable applications of our technologies 
we have limited financial and managerial resources 
these limitations require us to focus on a select group of product candidates in specific therapeutic areas and to forego the exploration of other product opportunities 
for example  a decision to concentrate on a particular indication within our neurology program may mean that we will not be able to allocate sufficient resources to fully exploit several different indications within our neurology program 
while our technologies may permit us to work in both areas  resource commitments may require trade offs resulting in delays in the development of certain programs or research areas  which may place us at a competitive disadvantage 
our decisions as to resource allocation may not lead to the development of viable commercial products and may divert resources away from other market opportunities which ultimately proved to be more profitable 
if any of our products ever receive regulatory approval for commercialization  the market may not be receptive to products we develop due to their use of new technologies or cost 
such a lack of reception would adversely affect expected revenues 
if any of our product opportunities ever receive regulatory approval  the commercial success of these products will depend upon their acceptance by patients  the medical community and third party payors 
our future products  if any are successfully developed  may not gain commercial acceptance among physicians  patients and third party payors  even if necessary marketing approvals have been obtained 
we believe that recommendations and endorsements by physicians will be essential for market acceptance of our products 
if we are not able to obtain a positive reception for our products  our expected revenues from sales of these products would be adversely affected 
our growth could be limited if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel and consultants 
our success depends on the ability to attract  train and retain qualified scientific and technical personnel to further our research and development efforts 
the loss of services of one or more of our key employees or consultants could have a negative impact on our business and operating results 
competition for hiring personnel in the biotechnology industry is intense and locating candidates with the appropriate qualifications can be difficult 
although we expect to be able to attract and retain sufficient numbers of highly skilled employees for the foreseeable future  we may not be able to do so 
any growth and expansion into areas and activities that may require additional human resources or expertise  such as regulatory affairs  compliance  manufacturing and marketing  would require us to hire new key personnel 
the pool of personnel with the skills that we require is limited 
competition to hire from this limited pool is intense  and we may not be able to hire  train  retain or motivate such additional personnel 
if we fail to obtain an adequate level of reimbursement for our future products from third party payors such as medicare or insurance companies  there may be no commercially viable markets for our products 
the availability of reimbursement by governmental and other third party payors for future products affects the market viability of any pharmaceutical product 
these governmental and third party payors persistently try to limit the costs of healthcare by exerting downward pressure on the prices for pharmaceutical products 
the net effect of this downward pressure can be reduced availability of reimbursement by governmental and other third party payors 
in some foreign countries  particularly the countries of the european union  the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control 
we or our partners may not be able to sell our products profitably if reimbursement is unavailable or limited in scope or amount 
in both the united states and some foreign jurisdictions  there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system 
further proposals are likely 
the potential for adoption of some or all of these proposals affects or will affect our ability to raise capital  obtain additional collaborative partners and to market our products 
if we or our collaborative partners obtain marketing approval for our products  we expect to experience pricing pressure due to the trend toward managed health care  the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations and additional legislative proposals 
we could be exposed to significant risk from liability claims if we are unable to obtain insurance at acceptable costs or otherwise protect ourselves against potential product liability claims 
we may be subjected to product liability claims arising from the testing  manufacturing  marketing and sale of human health care products 
product liability claims  inherent in the process of researching and developing human health care products  could expose us to significant liabilities and prevent or interfere with the development or commercialization of our product candidates 
product liability claims would require us to spend significant time  money and other resources to defend such claims and could ultimately lead to our having to pay a significant damage award 
product liability insurance is expensive to procure for biopharmaceutical companies such as ours 
although we maintain product liability insurance coverage for the clinical trials of our products  it is possible that we will not be able to obtain additional product liability insurance on acceptable terms  if at all  and that our product liability insurance coverage will not prove to be adequate to protect us from all potential claims 
risks relating to financing we have incurred substantial losses  we expect to continue to incur substantial losses and we may never achieve profitability 
we expect to incur substantial operating losses for the foreseeable future and we have no current sources of material ongoing revenue 
it is uncertain when  if ever  we will develop significant sources of ongoing revenue or achieve profitability  even if we are able to develop and commercialize products 
we expect to spend significant capital to fund our research and development programs for the foreseeable future 
as a result  we will need to generate significant revenues in order to achieve profitability 
we cannot be certain whether or when this will occur because of the significant uncertainties that affect our business 
we may require additional financing  which may be difficult to obtain and may dilute your ownership interest in us 
we will require substantial funds to continue our research and development programs 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the following continued progress in our research and development programs  as well as the magnitude of these programs  the cost of additional facilities requirements  if any  the timing  receipt and amount of milestone and other payments from collaborative partners  the timing  payment and amount of milestone license  royalty payments  research funding and royalties due to licensors of patent rights and technology used to make  use and sell our product candidates  the timing  receipt and amount of sales revenues and royalties  if any  from our product candidates in the market  the cost of manufacturing and commercialization activities  and the costs of preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims and other patent related costs  including litigation costs and technology license fees 
in  we expect to seek additional funding through collaborative arrangements with strategic partners and may seek additional funding through public or private financings 
the biotechnology market  however  is highly volatile and  depending on market conditions and the status of our development pipeline  additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we fail to obtain such additional financing on a timely basis  our ability to continue all of our research  development  commercialization  manufacturing and marketing activities will be adversely affected 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  dilution to our stockholders will result 
in addition  the terms of such a financing may adversely affect other rights of our stockholders 
we also could elect to seek funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain technologies  product candidates or products 
risks relating to clinical and regulatory matters we expect to rely heavily on third parties for the conduct of clinical trials of our product candidates 
if these clinical trials are not successful  or if we are not able to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals  we will not be able to complete development and commercialization of our products 
in order to obtain regulatory approval for the commercial sale of our product candidates  we will be required to complete extensive preclinical studies as well as clinical trials in humans to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our products 
we have limited experience in conducting clinical trials and expect to rely primarily on contract research organizations and collaborative partners for their performance and management of clinical trials of our product candidates 
clinical trials  if any  of our product candidates under development may not be successful 
furthermore  the timing and completion of clinical trials  if any  of our products  depend on  among other factors  the numbers of patients required for approval and the rate at which those patients are enrolled 
any increase in the required number of patients or decrease in recruitment rates may result in increased costs  program delays or both 
also  these products may not be effective in treating any of our targeted disorders or may prove to have undesirable or unintended side effects  toxicities or other characteristics that may prevent or limit their commercial use 
we could also experience delays in our preclinical trials of any of our product candidates  obtain unfavorable results in a development program  or fail to obtain regulatory approval for the commercialization of a product 
any of these events would adversely affect our ability to market a product candidate 
the development process necessary to obtain regulatory approval is lengthy  complex and expensive and we may not obtain necessary regulatory approvals 
in furtherance of our research programs  we and our collaborative partners are required periodically to obtain regulatory approval for our ongoing development activities and  in the future  our marketing and selling efforts 
if we are unable to navigate the complexities of dealing with the several interested regulatory agencies  we may not receive the necessary approvals to conduct clinical trials of our product candidates or to market and sell our product candidates 
in addition  regulatory agencies may not grant approvals on a timely basis or may revoke or significantly modify previously granted approvals 
delays in obtaining  or failure to obtain  necessary approvals could adversely affect our ability to market and sell our products and our ability to generate product revenue 
the process of obtaining fda and other required regulatory approvals is lengthy and expensive 
the time required for fda and other approvals is uncertain and typically takes a number of years  depending on the complexity and novelty of the product 
the process of obtaining fda and other required regulatory approvals for many of our products is further complicated because some of these products use non traditional or novel materials in non traditional or novel ways  and the regulatory officials have little precedent to follow 
we have only limited experience in filing and prosecuting applications for the conduct of clinical studies and for obtaining marketing approval 
any delay in obtaining or failure to obtain required clearance or approvals would reduce our ability to generate revenues from the affected product 
we also plan to rely significantly on contract research organizations and collaborative partners as we build internal capabilities 
our analysis of data obtained from preclinical activities is subject to confirmation and interpretation by regulatory authorities  which could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
any regulatory approval to market a product may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which we may market the product 
these limitations may restrict the size of the market for the product and affect reimbursement by third party payors 
we also are subject to numerous foreign regulatory requirements governing the design and conduct of the clinical trials and the manufacturing and marketing of our potential future products outside of the united states 
the approval procedure varies among countries and the time required to obtain foreign approvals often differs from that required to obtain fda approvals 
moreover  approval by the fda does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries  and vice versa 
even if we obtain marketing approval  our products will be subject to ongoing regulatory oversight which may affect our ability to successfully commercialize any products we may develop 
even if we receive regulatory approval of a product candidate  the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product is marketed or require costly post marketing follow up studies 
after we obtain marketing approval for any product  the manufacturer and the manufacturing facilities for that product will be subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the fda and other regulatory agencies 
the subsequent discovery of previously unknown problems with the product  or with the manufacturer or facility  may result in restrictions on the product or manufacturer  including withdrawal of the product from the market 
if we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements  we may be subject to fines  suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals  product recalls  seizure of products  operating restrictions  and criminal prosecution 
we are subject to governmental regulations other than those imposed by the fda 
we may not be able to comply with these regulations  which could subject us to penalties and otherwise result in the limitation of our operations 
in addition to regulations imposed by the fda  we are subject to regulation under the occupational safety and health act  the environmental protection act  the toxic substances control act  the research conservation and recovery act  as well as regulations administered by the nuclear regulatory commission  national restrictions on technology transfer  import  export and customs regulations and certain other local  state or federal regulation 
from time to time  other federal agencies and congressional committees have indicated an interest in implementing further regulation of biotechnology applications 
we are not able to predict whether any such regulations will be adopted or whether  if adopted  such regulations will apply to our business  or whether we would be able to comply with any applicable regulations 
our research and development activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials and chemicals 
although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with all applicable laws and regulations  we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury caused by these materials 
risks relating to product manufacturing and sales we will depend on third party manufacturers to produce most  if not all  of our products under development  and if these third parties do not successfully manufacture our products our business will be harmed 
if we receive the necessary regulatory approvals for our products under development  we expect to rely upon third parties  including our collaborative partners  to produce materials required for commercial production 
we may not be able to enter into commercial scale manufacturing contracts on a timely or commercially reasonable basis  if at all 
to the extent that we enter into manufacturing arrangements with third parties  we will be dependent upon these third parties to perform their obligations in a timely and effective manner 
if third party manufacturers with whom we contract fail to perform their obligations our competitive position and ability to generate revenue may be adversely affected in a number of ways  including  we may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials of product that are under development we may be delayed in submitting applications for regulatory approvals for our products  and we may not be able to meet commercial demands for any approved products 
we have no sales and marketing experience and  as such  will depend significantly on third parties who may not successfully sell our products 
we have no sales  marketing and products distribution experience 
we plan to rely solely on sales  marketing and distribution arrangements with third parties  including our collaborative partners 
for example  as part of our agreement with ortho biotech  we have granted ortho biotech an exclusive right to distribute bmp kidney and neurological disorders products  if any are ever successfully developed 
we may have to enter into additional marketing arrangements in the future and we may not be able to enter into these additional arrangements on terms which are favorable to us  if at all 
in addition  we may have limited or no control over the sales  marketing and distribution activities of these third parties and sales through these third parties could be less profitable to us than direct sales 
these third parties could sell competing products and may devote insufficient sales efforts to our products 
our future revenues will be materially dependent upon the success of the efforts of these third parties 
we may seek to independently market products that are not already subject to marketing agreements with other parties 
if we determine to perform sales  marketing and distribution functions ourselves  we could face a number of additional risks  including we may not be able to attract and build a significant and skilled marketing staff or sales force  the cost of establishing a marketing staff or sales force may not be justifiable in light of the revenues generated by any particular product  and our direct sales and marketing efforts may not be successful 
risks relating to intellectual property we may not be able to obtain patent protection for our discoveries and our technologies may be found to infringe patent rights of third parties 
the patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  including ours  are generally uncertain and involve complex legal  scientific and factual questions 
the long term success of our enterprise depends in significant part on our ability to obtain patents to protect our discoveries  protect trade secrets from disclosure to third party competitors  operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others  and prevent others from infringing on our proprietary rights 
patents may not issue from any of the patent applications that we own or license 
if patents do issue  the allowed claims may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology from exploitation by our competitors 
in addition  issued patents that we own or license may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
our patents also may not afford us protection against competitors with similar technology 
because patent applications in the united states are maintained in secrecy until patents issue  it is possible that third parties have filed or maintained patent applications for technology used by us or covered by our pending patent applications without our knowledge 
we may not have rights under patents which may cover one or more of our product candidates 
in some cases  these patents may be owned or controlled by third party competitors and may impair our ability to exploit our technology 
as a result  we or our collaborative partners may be required to obtain licenses under third party patents to develop and commercialize some of our product candidates 
if we are unable to secure licenses to such patented technology on acceptable terms  we or our collaborative partners will not be able to develop and commercialize the affected product candidate or candidates 
if we are unable to keep our trade secrets confidential  our technology and information may be used by others to compete against us 
we also rely significantly upon unpatented proprietary technology  information  processes and know how 
we seek to protect this information through confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants and other third party contractors as well as through other security measures 
these confidentiality agreements may be breached  and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach 
in addition  our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors 
we may become involved in expensive patent litigation or other intellectual property proceedings which could result in liability for damages or stop our development and commercialization efforts 
there have been substantial litigation and other proceedings regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries 
we may become a party to patent litigation or other proceedings regarding intellectual property rights 
situations which may give rise to patent litigation or other disputes over the use of our intellectual property include initiation of litigation or other proceedings against third parties to enforce our patent rights  initiation of litigation or other proceedings against third parties to seek to invalidate the patents held by these third parties or to obtain a judgment that our products or services do not infringe the third parties patents  participation in interference or opposition proceedings to determine the priority of invention if our competitors file patent applications that claim technology also claimed by us  initiation of litigation by third parties claiming that our processes or products or the intended use of our products infringe their patent or other intellectual property rights  and initiation of litigation by us or third parties seeking to enforce contract rights relating to intellectual property which may be important to our business 
the costs associated with any patent litigation or other proceeding  even if resolved favorably  likely would be substantial 
some of our competitors may be able to sustain the cost of such litigation or other proceedings more effectively than we can because of their substantially greater financial resources 
if a patent litigation or other intellectual property proceeding is resolved unfavorably  we or our collaborative partners may be enjoined from manufacturing or selling our products and services without a license from the other party and be held liable for significant damages 
moreover  we may not be able to obtain required licenses on commercially acceptable terms or any terms at all 
in addition  we could be held liable for lost profits if we are found to have infringed a valid patent  or liable for treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed a valid patent 
litigation results are highly unpredictable and we or our collaborative partners may not prevail in any patent litigation or other proceeding in which we may become involved 
uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could damage our ability to compete in the marketplace 
patent litigation and other proceedings may also absorb significant management time and expense 
if we breach any of the agreements under which we license or have acquired intellectual property from others  we could lose intellectual property rights that are important to our business 
we are a party to intellectual property licenses and agreements that are important to our business and expect to enter into similar licenses and agreements in the future 
these licenses and agreements impose various research  development  commercialization  sublicensing  royalty  indemnification  insurance and other obligations on us 
if we fail to perform under these agreements or otherwise breach obligations thereunder  we could lose intellectual property rights that are important to our business 
if licensees or assignees of our intellectual property rights breach any of the agreements under which we have licensed or assigned our intellectual property to them  we could be deprived of important intellectual property rights and future revenue 
we are a party to intellectual property out licenses  collaborations and agreements that are important to our business and expect to enter into similar agreements with third parties in the future 
under these agreements  we license or transfer intellectual property to third parties and impose various research  development  commercialization  sublicensing  royalty  indemnification  insurance  and other obligations on them 
if a third party fails to comply with these requirements  we generally retain the right to terminate the agreement  and to bring a legal action in court or in arbitration 
in the event of breach  we may need to enforce our rights under these agreements by resorting to arbitration or litigation 
during the period of arbitration or litigation  we may be unable to effectively use  assign or license the relevant intellectual property rights and may be deprived of current or future revenues that are associated with such intellectual property 
risks related to our common stock our common stock may be delisted from the nasdaq national market  which could reduce the liquidity of our common stock and adversely affect our ability to raise additional necessary capital 
on february   we received written notification from the nasdaq national market that for the last consecutive trading days the minimum bid price of our common stock had closed below the minimum of per share requirement to remain listed on the nasdaq national market 
in order to continue trading on the nasdaq national market  we must comply with the nasdaq national market s continued listing requirements  which require that we either maintain a minimum stockholders equity of million and a minimum closing bid price of per share or  if we fall below the minimum stockholder s equity requirement  maintain a minimum closing bid price of per share 
at february   we were in compliance with the minimum stockholder s equity requirement 
according to nasdaq national market rules  we have calendar days  or until may   to regain compliance with the minimum closing bid price requirement 
if  at any time before may   the bid price of our common stock closes at per share or more for a minimum of consecutive trading days  we will be deemed to be back in compliance with respect to the minimum bid price requirements 
if we do not satisfy the nasdaq national market s continued listing requirements by may   our common stock may be delisted from the nasdaq national market 
the delisting of our common stock may result in the trading of the stock on the nasdaq smallcap market or the otc bulletin board 
consequently  a delisting of our common stock from the nasdaq national market may reduce the liquidity of our common stock and adversely affect our ability to raise additional necessary capital 
nasdaq has proposed rule changes that would extend the calendar day grace period  between notification of noncompliance and delisting  to calendar days 
nasdaq has indicated that it has requested that the rules be effective upon filing for all issuers and applicable retroactively to issuers who have received deficiency letters but who have not been delisted 
the proposed rule changes are currently being considered by the sec and may not be approved 
we expect that our stock price will fluctuate significantly 
our common stock is listed on the nasdaq national market under the ticker symbol cris 
the stock market  particularly in recent years  has experienced significant volatility particularly with respect to biopharmaceutical and biotechnology based company stocks 
the volatility of biopharmaceutical and biotechnology based company stocks often does not relate to the operating performance of the companies represented by the stock 
factors that could cause such volatility in the market price of our common stock include announcements regarding new technologies by us or our competitors  market conditions in the biotechnology sectors  rumors relating to us or our competitors  litigation or public concern about the safety of our potential products  actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results  deviations in our operating results from the estimates of securities analysts  adverse results or delays in clinical trials  fda or international regulatory actions  and general market conditions 
if stockholders do not receive dividends  they must rely on stock appreciation for any return on their investment in us 
we have not declared or paid cash dividends on any of our capital stock 
we currently intend to retain earnings  if any  for future growth and  therefore  do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the future 
as a result  only appreciation of the price of the common stock will provide a return to investors 
we have anti takeover defenses that could delay or prevent an acquisition and could adversely affect our stock price 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation  our bylaws and delaware law may have the effect of deterring unsolicited takeovers or delaying or preventing changes in control of our management  including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices 
in addition  these provisions may limit the ability of stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interest 
our certificate of incorporation permits the board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval 
in addition to delaying or preventing an acquisition  the issuance of a substantial number of preferred shares could adversely affect the price of the common stock 
our certificate of incorporation provides for staggered terms to be served by the board of directors which makes it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of the board of directors in any one year 
in addition  our bylaws restrict the ability of stockholders to call a special meeting of the stockholders 
these provisions may have the effect of preventing or delaying changes in control of our management 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest cash balances in excess of operating requirements in cash equivalents and short term marketable securities  generally money market funds  insurance annuity contracts  corporate debt and government securities with an average maturity of less than one year 
all marketable securities are considered available for sale 
at december   the fair market value of these securities amounted to approximately  with net unrealized gains of approximately  included as a component of stockholders equity 
because of the quality of the investment portfolio and the short term nature of the marketable securities  we do not believe that interest rate fluctuations would impair the principal amount of the securities 
our investments are investment grade securities and deposits are with investment grade financial institutions 
we believe that the realization of losses due to changes in credit spreads is unlikely as we expect to hold our debt to maturity 
at december   we had approximately  outstanding under fixed rate debt and capital lease agreements which are not subject to fluctuations in interest rates and approximately  outstanding under a cash secured term loan agreement with an adjustable rate equal to as of december  in addition  we had approximately  including accrued interest of  outstanding under a convertible subordinated note payable to becton dickinson 
lastly   including accrued interest of  was outstanding under a convertible promissory note payable to epil in connection with curis newco
