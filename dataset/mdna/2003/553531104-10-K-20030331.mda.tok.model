recent acquisitions we acquired mechanical dynamics  inc mdi in and advanced enterprise solutions  inc aes in mechanical dynamics  inc on april   we completed the acquisition of the outstanding common stock of mdi through a tender offer 
mdi developed  marketed and supported functional virtual prototyping solutions 
this acquisition was completed because we believe the acquisition of mdi expands our core software offerings  complements our existing product and service offerings and increases our presence in the product lifecycle management market to better serve customers 
to accomplish the acquisition of mdi  we entered into the agreement and plan of merger dated march  with mdi 
following the consummation of a tender offer at per share in cash and the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions  all of the remaining outstanding shares of common stock of mdi were converted into the right to receive per share in cash 
as a result of the tender offer and merger  we acquired approximately  shares of common stock of mdi  representing percent of the outstanding shares of mdi at an aggregate price of approximately  we also agreed to redeem all outstanding mdi stock options  options for total consideration of  the difference between and the exercise price of the options 
the acquisition of mdi has been accounted for as a purchase  and accordingly  the results of operations of mdi since april  are included in our consolidated statement of operations 
an external valuation of the intangible assets acquired was performed as of the date of the acquisition 
the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair market value of the net tangible assets acquired was  pursuant to sfas  goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles will not be amortized  but will be evaluated for any indicators of impairment 
advanced enterprise solutions  inc on july   we completed the acquisition of aes 
aes is a systems and software integrator and the largest ibm product lifecycle management business partner in the americas  selling dassault systemes product lifecycle management software portfolio comprised of catia  enovia  delmia and smart solutions 
to accomplish the acquisition of aes  we entered into a stock purchase agreement with dassault systemes of america corp 
dsa  pursuant to which we purchased from dsa all of the shares of aes held by dsa 
we issued to dsa  shares of our common stock for dsa s minority interest in aes 
we also entered into an agreement and plan of merger with aes pursuant to which aes was merged with our wholly owned subsidiary  which resulted in aes becoming our wholly owned subsidiary 
in this transaction  the stockholders of aes  other than dsa  received  in cash  promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of  and  shares of our common stock 
we also assumed outstanding options to acquire aes common stock  which were converted into fully vested options  with time based exercise restrictions  to acquire  shares of our common stock 
the  shares of common stock issued as part of the transaction were valued at  based upon the fair value of our common stock immediately prior and subsequent to may   the date of the signing and announcement of the definitive acquisition agreement 
the options were valued at approximately  based on a calculation using the black scholes pricing model with the following assumptions no dividend yield  expected volatility of  a risk free rate of  and an expected life of years 
the promissory notes were recorded at their estimated fair value at time of issuance  net of a discount of  the promissory notes bear interest at with interest payments due semi annually in january and july 
the entire principal amount of the notes of  is due in july the acquisition of aes has been accounted for as a purchase  and accordingly  the results of operations of aes since july  the designated effective date when control of aes was passed to us are included in our consolidated statement of income 
an independent valuation of the intangible assets acquired was performed in the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair market value of the net assets acquired was  pursuant to sfas  goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles will not be amortized  but will be evaluated for any indicators of impairment 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in june  the fasb issued statements of financial accounting standards no

sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under these standards  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are subject to impairment tests at least annually 
under sfas no 
 goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
our reporting units are generally consistent with our operating segments 
this methodology differs from our previous policy  as permitted under accounting standards existing at that time  of using undiscounted cash flows on an enterprisewide basis to determine if goodwill is recoverable 
during the second quarter of  we completed the transitional impairment test required under the new rules and recorded a non cash charge of  to reduce the carrying value of goodwill effective in the first quarter of the impairment relates entirely to our systems reporting unit  which was almost entirely generated from the aes acquisition 
such charge is nonoperational in nature and is reflected as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in in calculating the impairment charge  the fair value of the impaired reporting unit underlying the system segment was estimated using either a discounted cash flow methodology or recent comparable transactions 
we engaged an external valuation firm to assist us in determining the impairment charge 
the impairment primarily resulted from an increase in our stock price immediately prior to the date that the aes acquisition was announced and valued for accounting purposes  as well as a decline in market multiples in the information systems reseller industry 
asset impairment and restructuring we have consistently followed the policy of capitalizing software development costs related to product development in accordance with the guidelines established under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed 
significant management judgment is required in determining whether technological feasibility has been achieved for a particular software project 
these capitalized software development costs are subject to an ongoing quarterly assessment of recoverability based on anticipated future revenue and changes in hardware and software technologies 
amortization of software development costs begins when the product is available for general release 
amortization is provided on a product by product basis on the greater of the straight line method over periods not exceeding three years or the sales ratio method that is based on expected unit sales and the estimated life of the product 
unamortized software development costs determined to be in excess of net realizable value of the product are expensed immediately 
accordingly  during  we recognized non cash pre tax charges of  related to the write down of the carrying value of capitalized software development costs 
the impairment was primarily due to the abandonment of certain products as a result of the acquisition of mdi as well as our restructuring during the second and third quarters 
due to the weakened economic conditions in all three world areas in which we operate  management determined in that our current and future revenue could not support our existing cost structure 
a review of our structure indicated several areas in which we could reduce costs 
it was determined that workforce reductions and facility consolidations would be necessary to return us to profitability 
in addition  the acquisition of mdi created certain redundant expenses that needed to be eliminated 
we accrued  of restructuring costs related to the integration of mdi  including severance and related charges associated with a worldwide reduction in force of mdi employees  transaction costs  costs related to closing redundant facilities and terminating contracts and other exit costs associated with the acquisition 
in accordance with emerging issuance task force issue no 
 recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination eitf  the costs related to the integration of mdi were included as assumed liabilities in the net tangible assets acquired 
in addition  we recorded a restructuring charge of  in related to the company s existing business operations 
these additional restructuring charges related to workforce reductions  impairment of assets caused by the terms of the mdi acquisition  to the consolidation of existing office facilities and other costs 
the acquisition of aes in created certain redundant expenses that needed to be eliminated 
in the third quarter of  we recorded a restructuring charge of  in addition  we recorded  of additional acquisition costs related to the integration of aes 
in accordance with eitf  the costs relating to the consolidation of aes office facilities were included in the purchase price allocation  resulting in additional goodwill 
the restructuring charge that related to our business of  was recorded as a charge to income in these restructuring charges related to the impairment of an asset caused by the terms of the aes acquisition and the consolidation of existing office facilities

revenue in europe generated from the recently acquired mdi was  of software revenue and  of services revenue 
while aes was essentially a domestic operation prior to our acquisition  the increase in systems revenue was primarily the result of our extension of this business into the european market 
asia pacific reported increases of  in software revenue   in services revenue and  in systems revenue 
the increase in revenue for asia pacific was primarily due to the acquisitions of mdi and aes  increases in paid up software licenses and increases in consulting services 
revenue in asia pacific generated from the recently acquired mdi was  of software revenue and  of services revenue 
while aes was essentially a domestic operation prior to our acquisition  the increase in systems revenue was primarily the result of our extension of this business into the asian pacific market 
revenue growth in was also impacted by favorable foreign currency translation rates for the euro and the japanese yen as compared to the prior year 
revenue for would have been approximately  if translated using the prior year s foreign currency translation rates 
revenue in local currencies increased and in europe and asia pacific  respectively 
our international operations in europe and asia pacific are sales organizations with high gross profit margins  which is due to these operations having minimal software development expenses 
as a result  we are exposed to the effects of foreign currency fluctuations of the united states dollar versus the japanese yen and the euro 
risks inherent in international revenue include the impact of longer payment cycles  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  seasonality due to the slowdown in european business activity during the third quarter  tariffs and other trade barriers  and difficulties staffing and managing foreign operations 
these factors may have a material adverse effect on our future international revenue 
our future profitability and rate of growth  if any  will be directly affected by increased price competition and an increasingly higher revenue base from which to grow 
our growth rate and net revenue depend significantly on renewals of existing orders as well as our ability to respond successfully to the pace of technological change and expand our customer base 
if our renewal rate or our pace of new customer acquisition slows  our net revenues and operating results would be adversely affected

cost of revenue services cost of revenue services was  or of services revenue  for compared to  or of services revenue  for the prior year 
the increase in cost of revenue services was primarily due to an increase in headcount during  including headcount additions as a result of the acquisition of mdi 
cost of revenue services  as a percentage of services revenue  will vary from period to period based upon actual projects being performed 
we expect such percentage to continue to approximate to in the future 
cost of revenue systems cost of revenue systems was  or of systems revenue  for compared to  or of systems revenue  for the increase in costs or revenue systems is primarily the result of the increase in systems revenue as described above 
the increase in cost of revenue systems  as a percentage of systems revenue  was the result of some larger individual transactions in  which typically have lower margins than small transactions 
gross profit gross profit  which is total revenue less cost of revenue  was  or of total revenue  for  compared to  or of total revenue  for  an increase of  or 
the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to the increase in systems revenue  which generates lower margins than software and services  and the decreased gross margin on services revenue as described above

capitalized software development costs were  for compared to  for the prior year  an increase of  or 
the amount of product development capitalized in any given period is a function of many factors  including the number of products under development at any point in time as well as their stage of development 
our product development process is continually under review to improve efficiency and product quality  and to reduce time to market 
due to the continual change in the product development process  there can be no assurance that the level of development capitalized in future periods will be comparable to current capitalized levels 
during   of capitalized software development costs were deemed to be impaired and were written off in accordance with sfas no 
this charge has been included in restructuring and other impairment charges in the accompanying consolidated financial statements

restructuring and other impairment charges restructuring charges were  or of total revenue  for  compared to  or of total revenue  for the restructuring charges in consist of  of charges related to workforce reductions   to the impairment of assets caused by the terms of the mdi acquisition and  to the consolidation of office facilities and other costs 
in addition  we recorded a write off of  of capitalized software development costs  described above 
in  the restructuring charges consist of  of charges related to the consolidation of office facilities and  to asset write downs 
write off of acquired in process r d fasb interpretation no 
 applicability of fasb statement no 
to business combinations accounted for by the purchase method  requires that any portion of the purchase price allocated to assets to be used in research and development projects that have no alternative future use be charged to expense at the date of the acquisition 
accordingly  during  we wrote off  of in process research and development acquired in connection with the acquisition of mdi and  of in process research and development acquired in connection with the acquisition of easy in process research and development ipr d projects were identified and valued through analysis of data provided by mdi and easy concerning developmental products  their stage of development  the time and resources needed to complete them  if applicable  their expected income generating ability  target markets and associated risks 
we retained an external valuation firm to assist us in determining the fair value of the acquired assets 
the primary technique utilized in valuing the acquired ipr d was the income approach  which includes an analysis of the markets  cash flows and risks associated with achieving such cash flows 
developmental projects that had reached technological feasibility were classified as developed technology  and the value was assigned to technology acquired and capitalized as intangible assets 
where the developmental projects had not reached technological feasibility and had no future alternative uses  they were classified as ipr d and charged to expense upon closing of the acquisition 
as of the acquisition date  all projects classified as ipr d projects were in the development stage and we expected to incur approximately  in additional costs before these projects would be complete 
in valuing the ipr d  we considered the importance of each project to the overall development plan  estimating costs to develop the purchased ipr d into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from the projects when completed and discounting the net cash flows to their present value 
the sales estimates used to value the purchased ipr d were based on estimates of relevant market sizes and growth factors  expected trends in technology and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by mdi and its competitors 
the rates utilized to discount the net cash flows to their present value are based on mdi s weighted average cost of capital 
given the nature of the risks associated with the difficulties and uncertainties in completing each project and thereby achieving technological feasibility  anticipated market acceptance and penetration  market growth rates and risks related to the impact of potential changes in future target markets  the weighted average cost of capital was adjusted 
based on these factors  discount rates of percent and percent were deemed appropriate for the acquired and in process technology  respectively 
the estimates used in valuing ipr d were based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
operating income loss operating loss was  for compared to operating income of  for total other expense total other expense was  for compared to  for  an increase of  or 
interest expense interest expense was  for compared to  for  an increase of  or

critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the untied states of america 
these accounting principles require us to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues  expenses  assets  liabilities and contingencies 
all significant estimates  judgments and assumptions are developed based on the best information available to us at the time made and are regularly reviewed and updated when necessary 
actual results will generally differ from these estimates 
changes in estimates are reflected in our financial statements in the period of change based upon on going actual experience trends or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies 
interim changes in estimates are generally applied prospectively within annual periods 
we have identified the following as critical accounting policies to our company revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts and litigation  capitalized software costs and valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
these accounting policies are considered to be critical in evaluating and understanding our financial results because they involve inherently uncertain matters and their application requires the most difficult and complex judgments and estimates 
revenue recognition on software and related service we provide a variety of licensing alternatives for the use of our software products 
our software products have been primarily offered on an annual non cancelable  pre paid license basis 
an annual non cancelable  pre paid license is set at a fixed rate for the period and provides for payment in advance of use 
in recent years  demand has also increased for paid up licenses for software products 
a paid up license provides significant revenue at the original time of sale of the product  with smaller payments for maintenance following the time of sale 
we apply statement of position  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions  to all transactions involving the sale of software products 
revenue on non cancelable  pre paid annual lease agreements is recognized monthly over the term of the agreement 
revenue from the sale of paid up licenses is recognized when we receive persuasive evidence of an arrangement generally a contract or purchase order  the software has been delivered to the customer  the price charged the customer is fixed or determinable  and collection is probable 
for multiple element arrangements when specific objective evidence of fair value does exist for all of the undelivered elements of the arrangement  but does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements in the arrangement  we recognized revenue under the residual method 
under the residual method  at the outset of the arrangement with a customer  we defer revenue for the fair value of the undelivered elements such as maintenance  and recognize the revenue for the remainder of the arrangement fee attributable to the elements initially delivered  such as software licenses  when the criteria in sop have been met 
maintenance and support revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the service period 
due to our settlement with the ftc  for our arrangements with customers that convert to a paid up license after november   we defer revenue for the fair value of the nastran paid up license because the arrangement is cancelable under certain circumstances pursuant to the ftc settlement and  as a result  the fee is not considered to be fixed or determinable 
we will recognize the related fee as revenue as the pro rata portion of the fee subject to cancellation lapses over time  in accordance with the ftc settlement 
revenue to be recognized from software arrangements is driven to a large extent by the nature of our contractual commitments to customers 
if those commitments change in the future such that we are required to provide services that are essential to the functionality of the software purchased by us or we commit to future deliverables for which specific objective evidence of fair value does not exist  the timing of when we will be able to recognize revenue will be delayed 
in addition  significant management judgments must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if our management made different judgments 
allowance for doubtful accounts and litigation the preparation of financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
specifically  our management must make estimates of the uncollectibility of our accounts receivable 
management analyzes specific customer accounts  historical bad debt  trends  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the allowance for doubtful accounts in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our losses for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was  at december  we do not currently maintain a reserve for any potential liability related to litigation 
management estimates the likelihood of loss and the range of liability related to pending litigation based on claims for which our management can estimate the amount and range of loss 
we record the minimum estimated liability related to those claims  where there is a range of probable loss 
because of the uncertainties related to both the amount and range of loss on litigation  management may be unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome 
as additional information becomes available  we will assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates 
such revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operations and financial position 
capitalized software costs the company capitalizes software developed for sale or lease in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed 
software costs incurred subsequent to the determination of the technological feasibility of the software product are capitalized 
significant management judgment is required in determining whether technological feasibility has been achieved for a particular software project 
capitalization ceases and amortization of capitalized costs begins when the software product is available for general release to customers 
capitalized software development costs  net of related amortization  are compared to management s estimate of projected revenues quarterly to determine if any impairment in value has occurred that would require an adjustment in the carrying value or change in expected useful lives under the guidelines established under sfas no 
the company has  of capitalized software as of december   net of accumulated amortization of  capitalized software amortization expense is included in cost of license revenue 
the amortization period for the software costs capitalized is the economic life of the related products  typically two to three years 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we determined that  of capitalized software development costs were impaired and were written off in accordance with sfas no 
the impairment was primarily due to the abandonment of certain products as a result of the acquisition of mdi as well as our restructuring during significant management judgment is required in evaluating capitalized software development costs for impairment because of the estimates involved in projecting future related product revenues 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  except for goodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles  we recognize impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amounts 
factors considered important which could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to  significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the assets or the strategy for our overall business and significant negative industry or economic trends 
if such assets are identified to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
when we determine that the carrying value of long lived assets  excluding goodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles  may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment and the carrying value of the asset cannot be recovered from projected undiscounted cash flows  we measure any impairment based on the present value of estimated expected future cash flows using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
long lived assets  excluding goodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles  amounted to  as of december  significant management judgment is required in determining whether an indicator of impairment exists and projecting cash flows 
any changes in the assumptions used in projecting cash flows or determining an appropriate discount rate could impact the assessed value of an asset and result in an impairment charged equal to the amount by which its carrying value exceeds its actual or estimated fair value 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles are tested annually or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of the asset has decreased below its carrying value 
the impairment review consists of a two step process step compare the fair value of our reporting units to the carrying value  including goodwill  of each of those units 
if a unit s fair value exceeds the carrying value  no further work is performed and no impairment charge is necessary 
for each reporting unit where the carrying value  including goodwill  exceeds the unit s fair value  step is required 
step allocate the fair value of the reporting unit to its identifiable tangible and non goodwill intangible assets and liabilities 
this will derive an implied fair value for the reporting unit s goodwill 
compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of its goodwill  an impairment loss must be recognized for the excess 
in calculating the impairment charge  the fair value of the impaired reporting unit would be estimated using either a discounted cash flow methodology or recent comparable transactions 
significant management judgment is required in determining the allocations required under this process and projecting cash flows 
any changes in the assumptions used in projecting cash flows or determining an appropriate discount rate could impact the assessed value of an asset and result in an impairment charged equal to the amount by which its carrying value exceeds its actual or estimated fair value 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles amounted to  as of december  in  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets became effective and as a result  we ceased to amortize approximately  of goodwill acquired prior to july  additionally  certain other intangible assets were classified as indefinite lived intangibles and are no longer amortized beginning on january  we recorded  of amortization on goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles during in lieu of amortization  we will be required to perform an annual impairment review of the goodwill and indefinite lived intangible balance 
effective january   we completed the transitional impairment test required upon the initial adoption of sfas no 
and recorded a  non cash charge to reduce the carrying value of existing goodwill 
accounting for income taxes we estimate our income tax provision to recognize our tax expense for the current year and our deferred tax liabilities and assets for future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements using current enacted tax laws 
deferred tax assets must be assessed based upon the likelihood of recoverability from future taxable income and to the extent that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance is established 
the allowance is regularly reviewed and updated for changes in circumstances that would cause a change in judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax assets 
these calculations and assessments involve complex estimates and judgments because the ultimate tax outcome can be uncertain or future events unpredictable 
liquidity and capital resources in the past  working capital needed to finance our operations has been provided by cash on hand and from cash flow from operations 
we believe that cash generated from operations will continue to provide sufficient capital for normal working capital needs in the foreseeable future 
we may engage in additional financing methods that we believe are advantageous  particularly to finance acquisitions 
net cash provided by operating activities was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our working capital current assets minus current liabilities at december  was  compared to  at december   a decrease of  the decrease in working capital was primarily caused by the acquisition of mdi  which was acquired through the use of existing cash and additional debt  as discussed below 
in connection with the acquisition of mdi in april  we entered into a revolving credit and term loan agreement  as amended loan agreement  with a bank 
the loan agreement included a  revolving line of credit and a  term loan 
in november  we replaced the loan agreement with a new loan and security agreement  including subsequent amendments new loan agreement  with a new lender lender 
the new loan agreement includes a  revolving line of credit and a  term loan 
borrowings under the revolving line of credit are limited to a borrowing base of up to of eligible domestic accounts receivable  as defined 
all amounts outstanding under the previous loan agreement were repaid 
the term loan is secured by substantially all of our assets and bears interest at the greater of or the lender s prime rate as of december  plus 
advances on the revolving line of credit bear interest at the greater of or the lender s prime rate plus 
the new loan agreement expires in november as of december    of the term loan was outstanding and no amount was outstanding on the line of credit 
we had  of availability on the line of credit as of december  the new loan agreement requires maintenance of certain financial and non financial covenants 
we are in compliance with all such covenants  as amended 
the new loan agreement required an origination fee of approximately  which is being amortized to expense over the months of the term loan 
in addition  an annual facility fee of of the total outstanding commitment will be paid and expensed quarterly 
in connection with the new loan agreement   of capitalized loan fees related to the loan agreement were written off in november and included as interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
in connection with the loan agreement   related to prior bank debt was repaid 
on august   we completed the sale of  shares of our common stock in a public offering 
the net proceeds to us  after the underwriter discount and estimated expenses  were approximately  we also received cash in the aggregate amount of  and  from the exercise of common stock options and warrants during and  respectively 
in  we issued  of convertible subordinated debentures in connection with an acquisition 
an additional  principal amount of convertible subordinated debentures was issued  at a discount  in in connection with the marc acquisition 
the debentures bore interest at with interest payments due semi annually on march and september the conversion feature permitted the holder to convert the debentures into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share 
the debentures were to mature august   but were redeemable at our option at any time after august  upon payment of a premium 
on july   we gave notice to the holders of our convertible subordinated debentures of our intent to redeem all such debentures 
the holders continued to have the right to convert the debentures into shares of our common stock at per share until august  holders converted  principal of the debentures into  shares of common stock and the remaining debentures were redeemed for  or of the principal balance plus accrued interest 
holders who elected to convert forfeited their rights to receive accrued interest that would otherwise be paid on the redemption date 
the forfeited interest of approximately  was recorded as expense and such accrued and unpaid interest  net of the tax effect of  was credited to common stock as part of the conversions 
in  we also issued subordinated notes payable in connection with the marc acquisition in the aggregate principal amount of  the subordinated notes payable bear interest at with interest payments due semi annually in january and july 
the estimated interest payment to be paid in january is  in february  the holder of these subordinated debentures used  of such debt as payment for the exercise of warrants 
the entire remaining principal balance as of december  of  is due by june in connection with the acquisition of aes  we issued notes payable to the former shareholders of aes in the aggregate principal amount of  the notes bear interest at with interest only payments due semi annually in january and july 
the estimated interest payment to be paid in january is  the entire principal balance as of december  of  is due in july we also assumed a note payable to dassault systemes of america corporation dsa as part of the acquisition of aes 
the note bears interest at 
we will repay the principal balance of the loan from commissions earned by selling dsa products 
any remaining unpaid principal balance will be due in june the outstanding principal of the dsa note payable at december  was  we expect to continue to invest a substantial portion of our revenues in the development of new computer software technologies and products and the enhancement of certain existing products 
during and  we expended a total of  and  respectively  on development efforts  of which  and  respectively  were capitalized 
product development costs and the capitalization rate may vary depending  in part  on the number of products and the stage of development of the products in process 
during and  we acquired  and  respectively  of new property and equipment 
the decrease in was primarily due to additional costs in associated with the relocation of our corporate headquarters to a new facility in santa ana  california 
capital expenditures also included upgrades in computer equipment in order to keep current with technological advances and upgrades of facilities worldwide 
our capital expenditures vary from year to year  as required by business needs 
we intend to continue to expand the capabilities of our computer equipment used in the development and support of our proprietary software products 
we do not plan to pay dividends in the foreseeable future 
in addition  our new loan agreement contains restrictions on the payment of dividends 
the following summarizes our contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods as of december  total less than year years years more than years contractual obligations note payable     subordinated notes payable   notes payable to shareholders    operating lease obligations    total contractual cash obligations   euro conversion on january   eleven of the fifteen member countries of the european union the participating countries established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies the legacy currencies and the euro currency  adopting the euro as their common legal currency on that date 
the legacy currencies remained legal tender in the participating countries as denominations of the euro between january  and january  during this transition period  public and private parties paid for goods and services using either the euro or the participating country s legacy currency on a no compulsion  no prohibition basis whereby recipients accepted euros or the legacy currency as offered by the payer 
beginning january   the participating countries issued new euro denominated bills and coins and replaced the legacy currencies as legal tender in cash transactions by july  we have implemented an upgrade to our management information system  which includes the ability to simultaneously record transactions in euros  perform the prescribed currency conversion computations and convert legacy currency amounts to euro 
as a result  the impact of the conversion on currency risk and taxable income has not been significant 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in april  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
 rescission of the fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections sfas 
sfas eliminates the requirements to classify gains and losses from the extinguishment of indebtedness as extraordinary  requires certain lease modifications to be treated the same as a sale leaseback transaction  and makes other non substantive technical corrections to existing pronouncements 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after may   with earlier adoption encouraged 
management does not believe that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our financial position 
in july  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
sfas requires the recognition of costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
examples of costs covered by sfas include lease termination costs and certain employee severance costs that are associated with a restructuring  discontinued operations  plant closing or other exit or disposal activities 
sfas is effective prospectively for exit or disposal activities initiated after december   with earlier adoption encouraged 
management does not believe that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our financial position 
in december  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  transition and disclosure  an amendment to fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas provides alternative methods of transition for an entity that voluntarily changes to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
it also amends the disclosure provisions of sfas to require prominent disclosure about the effects on reported net income of an entity s accounting policy decisions with respect to stock based employee compensation 
finally  sfas amends apb opinion no 
 interim financial reporting  to require disclosures about those effects in interim financial information 
the amendments to sfas no 
that provide alternative methods of transition for an entity that voluntarily changes to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation are effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after december  the amendment to sfas no 
relating to the disclosures and the amendment to opinion is effective for financial reports containing condensed financial statements for interim periods beginning after december  the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin elaborates on the existing disclosure requirements for most guarantees  including loan guarantees such as standby letters of credit  and provides new disclosure requirements regarding indemnification provisions typically included in a software license arrangement 
fin also clarifies that at the time a company issues a guarantee  it must recognize an initial liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee  including its ongoing obligation to stand ready to perform over the term of the guarantee in the event that specified triggering events or conditions occur 
the provisions related to recognizing a liability at inception of the guarantee do not apply to product warranties  indemnification provisions in software license arrangements  or guarantees accounted for as derivatives 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions apply on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements for fin are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in january the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements 
fin explains how to identify variable interest entities and how an enterprise assesses its interests in a variable interest entity to decide whether to consolidate that entity 
this interpretation requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the primary beneficiary is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns  or both 
fin is effective immediately for variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
the interpretation applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june   to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  we do not expect the adoption of fin to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
the emerging issues task force eitf recently reached a consensus on its tentative conclusions for eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf provides accounting guidance for the allocation of revenue where delivery or performance of products  services and or performance may occur at different points in time or over different periods of time 
companies are required to adopt this consensus for fiscal periods beginning after june  we believe the adoption of eitf will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and interest rate changes 
foreign currency risk international revenues were  and of our total revenues for  and respectively 
international sales are made mostly from our two foreign sales subsidiaries in germany and japan and are typically denominated in the local currency of each country 
these subsidiaries also incur most of their expenses in the local currency 
accordingly  all foreign subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency 
our international business is subject to risks typical of an international business  including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations arises in part from intercompany accounts in which cash from sales of our foreign subsidiaries are transferred back to the united states 
these intercompany accounts are typically denominated in the functional currency of the foreign subsidiary in order to centralize foreign exchange risk with the parent company in the united states 
we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into united states dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall expected profitability 
interest rate risk our exposure to market rate risks for changes in interest rates relates to any variable interest rate borrowings under our line of credit and term loan 
refer to note financial instruments in notes to consolidated financial statements 
the table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates
