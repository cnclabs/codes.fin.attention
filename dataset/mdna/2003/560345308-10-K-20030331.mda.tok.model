item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations background we commenced our restaurant operations in may with the acquisition of four tgi friday s restaurants in arizona and nevada 
during the past twelve years  we have grown through acquisitions and development of new restaurants 
we currently own restaurants and manage an additional four restaurants 
in  we had a change in management and implemented a long term business strategy to enhance our financial position  to place more emphasis on our casual dining business in certain designated markets  and to dispose of underperforming assets 
the first step was to strengthen our financial position by i the sale of  shares of common stock for  through a private placement transaction in january  ii the sale of five restaurants in northern california in january for  of which  in proceeds were used to repay debt  iii new borrowings of  with a repayment period of years  and iv recording writeoffs related to the disposition of various non core assets and the write down of certain core assets to realizable values 
proceeds from the new borrowings were used primarily to pay off debt with shorter repayment periods 
we also renegotiated our development agreements with carlson restaurants worldwide  inc to reduce the number of tgi friday s restaurants we were required to build  with the intent to focus on those development territories that were most economically favorable 
we strengthened our operations and commenced expansion plans  principally through developing tgi friday s restaurants 
this expansion was financed by borrowings from various lenders 
in  we acquired our redfish restaurants and in we acquired the bamboo club restaurants and concept 
the bamboo club acquisition was financed in part with cash raised by a rights offering to stockholders in in  we entered into a new loan with bank of america for  which was sufficient to fund all of the tgi friday s restaurants completed by june we executed an interest rate swap and locked in our interest rate on  of the loan total 
we believe that this is a favorable rate  as our existing financing is at a higher rate  and that this portion of the loan will be sufficient to fund our current construction and expansion of tgi friday s restaurants 
the interest rate is performance based and indexed to the libor rate plus a predetermined spread based upon our adjusted senior funded debt as defined in the loan documents to ebitda 
as of december   the interest rate was 
the interest rate swap qualifies as a cash flow hedge in accordance with sfas no 
on a quarterly basis  we adjust the fair market value of the swap on the balance sheet and offset the amount of the change to other comprehensive income 
in  operations were impacted by soft economic conditions  especially in the fourth quarter and subsequent to the september th attacks on america 
these conditions halted our positive same store sales increase record at consecutive quarters and predicated the fourth quarter impairment write down of five owned restaurants and the management agreement receivable impairment write down for six stores we managed in northern california and el paso  texas 
the total impairment charges were  of which  related to owned assets and  related to the management agreement receivable impairment 
we also faced two distinctive challenges in our tg i 
friday s california market  which affected operational profitability i a per hour minimum wage increase effective january   and ii controlling escalating utility prices 
to effectively combat these challenges  we implemented a new labor program for our top store managers to manage multiple locations  where it was geographically efficient  and we implemented utility programs to measure optimum usage and to ensure cost efficiency 
we opened seven new restaurants in  including three tgifriday s  one redfish  and three bamboo club locations 
the tgi friday s restaurants are located in west albuquerque  new mexico  roseville  california sacramento area  and porter ranch  california los angeles area 
the redfish restaurant is located in north scottsdale  arizona  and the bamboo club restaurants are located in tampa  florida  wellington  florida west palm beach area  and tempe  arizona phoenix area 
we opened six new restaurants in  including one tgi friday s and one redfish in chandler  arizona  three bamboo clubs in tucson  arizona  newport  kentucky  and king of prussia  pennsylvania  and one alice cooper stown in cleveland  ohio in the location formally occupied by an underperforming redfish restaurant we closed 
in addition  we closed an underperforming redfish in san diego  california and subleased the premises to a local san diego nightclub operator 
we also closed underperforming tgi friday s restaurants in kansas city  missouri and in el paso  texas 
during the third quarter of  we recorded charges for i the write down of land held for sale of  and ii impairment charges and other of  including asset impairment for an under performing restaurant location that was closed  an allocation of  of goodwill and  in lease cancellation charges related to this closure 
in the fourth quarter of  in response to a difficult and soft national economy  we decided i we would terminate several existing leases for bamboo club locations  where we have not yet built a restaurant  ii we would not renew leases for restaurants whose lease terms expired in  and iii we would record impairment charges for under performing restaurants 
the asset impairment and estimated lease termination fees recorded in the fourth quarter of were  including an allocation of  of goodwill 
critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
such estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances 
we believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable in the circumstances  however  actual results may differ from these estimates under different future conditions 
we believe that the estimates and assumptions that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  in that they require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  form the basis for the accounting policies deemed to be most critical to our operations 
these critical accounting policies relate to the valuation and amortizable lives of long lived assets  goodwill  and to other identifiable intangible assets  valuation of deferred tax assets  reserves related to self insurance for workers compensation and general liability  and recognition of stock based employee compensation 
these policies are as follows we periodically perform asset impairment analysis of long lived assets related to our restaurant locations  goodwill  and other identifiable intangible assets 
we perform these tests whenever we experience a triggering event  such as a decision to close a location or major change in the locations operating environment  or other event that might impact our ability to recover our asset investment 
also  we have a policy of reviewing the financial operations of our restaurant locations on at least a quarterly basis 
locations that are not meeting expectations are identified and continue to be watched closely throughout the year 
primarily in the fourth quarter  actual results are reviewed and budgets for the ensuing year are analyzed 
if we deem that a locations results will continue to be below expectations  alternatives for its continued operation are considered 
at this time  we perform an asset impairment test  if it is determined that the asset s fair value is less than book value and we will be unable to recover our investment through operations  an impairment charge is recorded 
upon an event such as a formal decision for abandonment restaurant closure  we may record additional impairment of assets and an allocation of goodwill if the location was one that was acquired 
any carryover basis of assets is depreciated over the respective remaining useful lives 
periodically we record or reduce the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized  based upon recent past financial performance  tax reporting positions and expectations of future taxable income 
we use an actuarial based methodology utilizing our historical experience factors to periodically adjust self insurance reserves for workers compensation and general liability claims and settlements 
these estimates are adjusted based upon annual information received in july of each year in connection with policy renewals 
estimated costs for the following year are accrued on a monthly basis and progress against this estimate is reevaluated based upon actual claim data received each quarter 
we use the method of accounting for employee stock options allowed under apb opinion and have adopted the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
 which require pro forma disclosure of the impact of using the fair value at date of grant method of recording stock based employee compensation 
we believe estimates and assumptions related to these critical accounting policies are appropriate under the circumstances  however  should future events or occurrences result in unanticipated consequences  there could be a material impact on our future financial condition or results of operations

payroll and benefit costs increased as a percentage of revenue to in from for the comparable period in this increase was primarily due to a per hour minimum wage increase in our california market effective january   and increases in management labor and benefits resulting from lower turnover 
as discussed below  new manager labor expense is charged to the new manager training expense account 
therefore  when turnover is lower  less labor is charged to the new manager training expense account and more labor remains in the payroll and benefits account 
payroll and benefits increases were also the result of higher health insurance costs 
depreciation and amortization before income from restaurant operations includes depreciation of restaurant property and equipment and amortization of franchise fees and liquor licenses 
depreciation and amortization decreased as a percentage of revenue to in from for the comparable period in  primarily due to a reduction in depreciation expense due to the impairment of assets for several under performing locations recorded in december  and additional asset impairments recorded in the third quarter of other operating expenses include rent  real estate taxes  common area maintenance charges  advertising  insurance  maintenance  and utilities

each year we contribute to a tgi friday s national marketing pool 
in  the pool contribution was of net sales for the first three fiscal quarters and of net sales for the fourth quarter 
the pool contribution percentage decreased because carlson restaurants worldwide cancelled its tgi friday s national advertising campaign for the entire fourth quarter of in  the contribution to the fund was of sales  resulting in an increase over the prior year 
this contribution offsets a portion of our general marketing requirement 
depreciation and amortization after income from restaurant operations includes depreciation of corporate property and equipment  amortization of identifiable intangibles  and amortization of goodwill as applicable 
depreciation and amortization decreased as a percentage of revenue to in from for the comparable period in  as a result of the elimination of goodwill amortization under sfas no

pre opening expenses were  or of revenue  at december  as compared to  or of revenue  for the year ended december  although we opened six stores in compared to seven stores in  our expenses were higher in due primarily to incurring costs in for new store openings in  combined with increases in employee recruiting and training  new store opening team travel  and promotional events 
the majority of pre opening expenses occur during the two months prior to opening a store 
new manager training expenses are those costs incurred in training newly hired or promoted managers  as well as those costs incurred to relocate those managers to permanent management positions 
new manager training expenses were  or of revenue  for the year ended december  as compared with  or of revenue  for the period in although new manager training expenses were consistent as a percentage of revenue  the increases in were primarily the result of new store openings in compared to and expenses incurred in related to new stores to be opened in early in  the impairment charges and other account included the impairment of certain leasehold improvements and other operating assets 
the account included i  to primarily reduce the carrying value of these assets on under performing locations to their estimated fair value  ii  of goodwill allocated to one closed location kansas city  missouri  and two impaired california locations where we have decided not to renew the lease when the initial terms expire in  iii  in lease cancellation charges and  in asset write downs for three bamboo club locations that we have elected not to open  and iv lease cancellation costs of  for one location where we decided to cancel a lease early leawood  ks 
during the third quarter of  we also reduced the value of the land and building we are holding for sale in el paso  texas by  during the fourth quarter of  we recorded an impairment expense of  against a management agreement with cnl 
under management agreements  we manage four tgi friday s stores in northern california and managed one tg i 
friday s store in el paso  texas 
during the fourth quarter  the el paso  texas location was closed 
under these agreements  we are entitled to a management fee if certain cash flow levels are achieved 
based on the cash flow provisions of the management agreements  we were unable to record management fee income during compared to  or of revenue  in interest expense and other  net was approximately  or of revenue in compared with  or of revenue in although we incurred additional debt and a corresponding increase in interest expense in  the increased expenses compared with were offset by more favorable interest rate conditions on our variable interest rate debt 
as of december   approximately of our total debt was tied to variable interest rates 
during the years ended december  and december  we had average outstanding borrowings of  and  respectively  with effective interest rates of and  respectively 
as a result of a substantial net loss during  we provided an additional valuation allowance to fully reserve all of its net deferred tax asset 
an income tax benefit of  was recorded in because we offset net operating loss carryforwards against taxable income 
we were in a taxable income situation in due to the recognition of various timing differences from at december   we had approximately  of net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards available to offset future income for federal income tax purposes 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenue for the fiscal year ended december  increased to million compared with million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily a result of opening seven new restaurants in and seven new restaurants in same store sales increased for fiscal as compared with an increase in same store sales of for the comparable period in same stores sales percentages represent sales for stores that have been open for at least months 
revenue from alcoholic beverages accounted for of revenue in and in cost of sales as a percentage of revenue decreased to in from in this decrease from the comparable period in resulted from multiple factors 
food costs were higher in because we were required to find alternative food suppliers to replace ameriserve  our primary food supplier who declared bankruptcy in the first quarter of additionally  we experienced increased food costs in due to sales mix changes and increases in meat and cheese costs 
we offset these increases through improved operations  better margins on alcohol sales  and maturing relationships with our suppliers that led to more favorable contract terms 
payroll and benefit costs increased as a percentage of revenue to in from for the comparable period in this increase was primarily due to a per hour minimum wage increase in our california market effective january  and higher management labor and benefits resulting from lower turnover

other operating expenses increased as a percentage of revenue to in from for the comparable period in the increase was due primarily to additional unit level advertising efforts  store rent increases  and additional energy and workers compensation costs  especially in california 
reduction of disputed liabilities in represents the one time settlement proceeds paid to us for the ameriserve bankruptcy claim 
ameriserve was our primary food supplier until they declared bankruptcy in the first quarter of amortization of intangible expenses include amortization on capitalized liquor licenses  loan financing fees  franchise fees  and goodwill 
these amortization expenses decreased as a percentage of revenue to in from for the comparable period in the decrease in was primarily due to spreading a small increase in fixed expenses over a larger revenue base 
general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of revenue to  or in from  or for the comparable period in the decrease was primarily due to reduced legal fees and recruiting expenses as we hired both an in house attorney and recruiter during in addition  reduction in travel expenses related to postponing all non mandatory travel during the fourth quarter of after the events of september contributed to the overall decrease 
pre opening expenses of  or of revenue  were charged to operations during the year ended december  as compared to  or of revenue  being charged to operations during the year ended december  the increase was due to the opening of two bamboo clubs outside of our phoenix  arizona market central florida that resulted in additional travel expenses for our new store opening teams 
new manager training expenses are those costs incurred in training newly hired or promoted managers  as well as those costs incurred to relocate those managers to permanent management positions 
these expenses decreased to  or of revenue  for the year ended december  as compared to  or of revenue  for the year ended december  primarily as a result of lower turnover 
in and  impairment charges and other included the impairment of certain leasehold improvements and other operating assets in accordance with sfas no 
the charges amounted to  in and  in  to reduce the carrying value of these assets to their estimated fair value

other charges in included the final settlement proceeds of  net  received from the city and county of san francisco  california in connection with condemnation proceedings against a restaurant we owned 
management fee income represents of store gross revenue charged to five tgi friday s locations we managed in northern california and one location in el paso  texas for cnl 
based on the impairment of the management agreement in the fourth quarter of  we did not record any management fee income for the fourth quarter of interest expense and other  net was approximately  in compared with  in the net expense decreased as a percentage of revenue to in from for the comparable period in although we incurred additional debt and a subsequent increase in interest expense in  the increased expenses compared with were offset by more favorable interest rate conditions on our variable interest rate debt 
as of december   approximately of our total debt was tied to variable interest rates 
during the years ended december  and december  we had average outstanding borrowings of  and  respectively  with effective interest rates of and  respectively

liquidity and capital resources our primary use of funds over the past five years has been for the acquisition of existing tgi friday s restaurants  the development of new tgi friday s restaurants  and the acquisition and development of the redfish and bamboo club restaurants and concepts 
these acquisitions were financed principally through a new stock rights offering issuance  the issuance of long term debt  and internally generated cash 
in october  we renewed a million revolving line of credit with comerica bank 
the agreement contained financial covenants which limit the amount of total debt we can incur 
we did not borrow any amounts under this line and had no amounts outstanding at december  because of the restrictions placed by the financial covenants of this agreement  we cancelled this agreement in march in july  we amended our bank of america development facility to provide for an additional  in financing 
during  we borrowed an additional  to fund construction on two locations tgi friday s san tan  chandler  arizona and porter ranch  california and to refinance two existing locations tg i 
friday s cerritos  california and oxnard  california for which we paid off higher rate debt 
by september   we had fully utilized our development facility with bank of america 
we are currently in negotiations with bank of america to finance the t 
g 
i 
friday s location being built at desert ridge mall  arizona 
in october  we secured a million financing commitment through ge franchise finance 
the terms include million for financing of equipment and leasehold improvements for the seven bamboo clubs already open and approximately million for new bamboo club development 
at december   there were no amounts borrowed under this commitment 
all of our loan agreements contain various financial covenants that are generally measured at the end of each quarter 
at december   we met all of the financial covenants for all debt agreements  with the exception of one covenant with comerica bank with whom we had a million line of credit 
due to the restrictive covenants contained in this agreement  at december  we were unable to utilize the line of credit 
since we were required to pay a non use fee under this financing agreement  we made the decision to cancel this line in march our recent operations have been negatively impacted by an economic slow down  and resulting same store sales declines 
we have reduced new store development  and cancelled certain leases on locations where construction has not yet begun to reduce the need for capital 
if the economic trend worsens  coupled with the new restaurant development planned in  and resulting borrowings to finance the cost of building these new restaurants  we may violate one or more of these covenants with any one of our lenders at the end of the second quarter of based on our debt covenants  at december   we have no significant borrowing capabilities under any of our debt agreements 
some of our financial covenants are dependant upon profitable operations and limit the total amount of debt we can have outstanding 
if economic conditions remain depressed  this could have a material adverse effect on our business and prevent us from having the cash availability to fund new restaurant development 
we believe we will remain in compliance with our current debt agreements or will receive the necessary modifications  if needed  to our debt covenants  and if there is an improvement in the general economic conditions in our key markets  we believe that our current cash resources  additional debt financing commitments  sale of assets  and expected cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund our planned development through as discussed previously discussed  other than the one tg i 
friday s we currently have under construction desert ridge mall  arizona  we do not anticipate building additional tg i 
friday s during with regard to our development agreement which requires the development of five tg i 
friday s locations in  we have every expectation  based on amendments and waivers received in prior years  that we will receive the appropriate waivers for we believe we may need to obtain capital to fund additional growth beyond potential sources of any such capital include bank financing  strategic alliances  and additional offerings of our equity or debt securities 
we cannot provide assurance that such capital will be available from these or other potential sources  and the lack of capital could have a material adverse effect on our business 
net cash flows from operating activities were  in  and  in  and  in these were supplemented by net cash flows from financing of  in   in   in  which we used to fund our acquisitions and development of new restaurants 
net cash used in investing activities was  in   in  and  in  which we used primarily to fund property and equipment purchases for our new restaurants and to acquire franchise rights and goodwill related to both the purchase and opening of new restaurants 
these amounts were offset by cash received from the sale of assets related to our sale leaseback transactions 
our current liabilities exceed our current assets due in part to cash expended on our development requirements and because the restaurant business receives substantially immediate payment for sales  while payables related to inventories and other current liabilities normally carry longer payment terms  usually to days 
at december   we had a working capital deficit of approximately  at december   we had a cash balance of  long term debt of  and current portion of long term debt of  monthly cash receipts have been sufficient to pay all obligations as they become due 
approximately  of this debt is a term loan comprised of five notes payable to one lender 
three of the notes bear interest at per annum and two of the notes bear interest at the one month libor rate plus basis points 
the notes mature on may  during november  we entered into two working capital revolving loan agreements with another lender 
one agreement provides for a maximum of  to finance up to of the costs to develop seven tgi friday s restaurants 
borrowings under this agreement will mature in years 
these borrowings are secured by the assets financed with the borrowings and are guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries 
the other agreement provides for a maximum of  to finance of the costs to furnish and equip seven tgi friday s restaurants 
borrowings under this agreement are secured by the assets financed with the borrowings and will mature in seven years 
borrowings under both agreements bear interest at over the day dealer commercial paper rate  as defined in the agreements  or a combined rate of at december  at december   we had outstanding borrowings of  under these agreements 
these agreements include covenants related to our fixed charge coverage ratio and debt to adjusted cash flow ratio 
we were in compliance with these covenants at december  the remainder of our long term debt consists of notes payable to various lending institutions 
these notes bear interest at rates ranging from to and mature at various times over the next years 
we lease all of our restaurants with terms ranging from to years 
our future debt  lease  and purchase obligations are summarized by year as follows in thousands contractual obligations and commitments greater less than one to three three to five than five total one year years years years debt maturities      minimum lease commitments      purchase commitments   total      minimum lease commitments represent operating leases  which are off balance sheet financings 
we have no other off balance sheet financings 
a default under a lease agreement could result in damages or the acceleration of amounts due under the lease 
total purchase commitments include remaining construction costs for the three restaurants currently under construction one t 
g 
i 
friday s at desert ridge mall  arizona  and the two bamboo club restaurants one in novi  michigan and one at desert ridge mall  arizona 
as a result of our substantial loss in  we submitted a quick refund application to the internal revenue service for refund of an overpayment of federal taxes of approximately  we believe that our current resources and expected cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund our capital needs and debt maturities during the next months 
prolonged future adverse geopolitical and economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our financial capabilities
