table of contents part i item business overview plx technology  inc plx or the company  a delaware corporation established in may  develops and supplies semiconductor devices that accelerate and manage the transfer of data in networking and telecommunications  enterprise storage  servers  personal computers  imaging and industrial equipment 
we offer a complete solution consisting of three related types of products semiconductor devices  software development kits and hardware design kits 
our semiconductor devices simplify the development of data transfer circuits in high performance embedded systems and computers and are compatible with microprocessors such as motorola s powerpc  intel s i and strongarm  broadcom s mips  pmc sierra s mips  and dsps from companies such as texas instruments 
our software development kits and hardware design kits promote sales of our semiconductor devices by lowering customers development costs and by accelerating their ability to bring new products to market 
in the last decade  demand for networking  telecommunications and other equipment that transmits  stores and processes information rapidly has increased due to growth of the internet  deployment of high speed networking  and proliferation of multimedia 
suppliers of this equipment seek to reduce product development time and to use their scarce engineering resources more efficiently 
until recently  these suppliers typically developed their own system components and the connections between the components 
now  however  they are increasingly building their equipment based on industry standard connection methods and purchasing components supplied by other companies that comply with these standards 
by doing so  they reduce the time and resources required for product development 
consequently  there is a growing demand for standards based components that connect systems together  such as our semiconductor devices 
the majority of products we ship today are based on peripheral component interconnect  or pci  an interconnect standard that is widely used in our markets 
plx is an active member of many of the trade associations that define current and future interconnect standards including pci  compact pci  pci express  rapidio  hypertransport and infiniband 
our objective is to expand our advantages in data transfer technology by focusing on high growth markets  delivering comprehensive solutions  including semiconductor devices  software development kits and hardware design kits  extending our technology advantages by incorporating new functions and technologies  driving industry standards  and strengthening and expanding our industry relationships

industry background embedded systems are found in many common products and offer varying levels of performance depending on each product s requirements 
these products range from low performance devices such as electronic toys and kitchen appliances to complex  high performance electronic equipment such as network routers and switches 
high performance embedded systems offer increased data processing capabilities and typically utilize one or more bit or bit microprocessors  fast memories and peripherals  and sophisticated operating systems or control code 
the growth of the communications infrastructure has increased the demand for high performance embedded systems and communication related server and personal computer pc adapter cards 
this demand has been fueled by the growth of the internet  the deployment of high speed networking systems to transmit  store  and process data  and the proliferation of data types in the network  including voice traffic and multimedia 
markets for electronic equipment that rely on high performance embedded systems include the following networking and telecommunications 
networking and telecommunications applications include digital telephony  multimedia gateways  wireless base stations  remote access servers  routers  switches and cable modem equipment 
this market segment has grown rapidly due to the rise of the internet and the proliferation of high bandwidth communication technologies such as fast ethernet  gigabit and gigabit ethernet  asynchronous transfer mode  or atm  cable modems  digital subscriber line  or xdsl  and voice over ip  or voip 
enterprise storage 
enterprise storage applications include disk storage subsystems  automated tape libraries and file servers 
the growing use of multimedia applications and storage networks is driving corporate demand for increased data storage capacity 
imaging 
imaging applications include printers  copiers  medical instrumentation and video and graphics equipment 
the demand for better image quality and higher performance  as well as connection of these applications to high speed networks  have increased their data processing requirements 
industrial 
industrial applications include a wide range of process control computers and factory automation equipment 
these products have high data transfer rate requirements  are used to monitor and control complex processes in real time and are being increasingly attached to networks 
manufacturers of products that rely on high performance embedded systems seek to maximize the performance and minimize the cost of their increasingly complex products 
in addition  these manufacturers must develop and bring new products to market quickly to keep pace with technological advancements 
the i o subsystem a typical computer system can be described in terms of four primary functions the host microprocessor  the memory  the peripherals and the input output  or i o  subsystem 
the host microprocessor is the primary control center for the system 
the memory acts as a storage area for instructions to be executed and data to be processed 
the peripherals enable connections between the system and other external devices such as network components  printers and storage systems 
the i o subsystem is the interconnect circuitry and software that connects these three other functions and allows for the transfer of instructions and data among these functions 
the i o subsystem includes the system bus or switch fabric  which is a physical connection between these different functions 
to enable increased performance and functionality from computer systems  semiconductor suppliers have historically focused on improving the operation of peripherals  microprocessors and memories 
the interconnect 
table of contents silicon in the i o subsystem must also improve to keep pace with these improvements by transferring more information at faster speeds 
in parallel with the increased performance demands of customers and their data traffic  the reliability of these systems is under constant pressure to improve 
this is especially true as the networking and telecommunications disciplines merge through use of the internet to carry all types of traffic 
highly available systems are required to meet the expectations of customers 
as data transfer requirements for the i o subsystem have increased  so has the complexity of its interface components such as processors  logic and related software 
until a few years ago  most embedded systems used simple i o subsystems that contained limited logic and rudimentary software  if any 
complex i o subsystem components such as processors  elaborate control logic and advanced software were costly  and therefore their use was confined to very high end equipment such as mainframe computers 
furthermore  the lack of widely accepted i o standards impeded the use of complex i o subsystems in other than high end applications 
however  advances in semiconductor technology combined with the widespread adoption of standards in embedded systems have enabled the development of highly integrated semiconductor devices that can better manage i o subsystem performance at lower cost 
penetration of i o standards in embedded systems until a few years ago  embedded systems manufacturers relied on a wide variety of proprietary solutions and a fragmented set of industry standard i o architectures 
for example  many networking  imaging  storage and industrial applications employed proprietary architectures to meet their specific performance and cost requirements 
a mix of standard buses such as vmebus  multibus and isa was used in some industrial  telecommunications and military applications 
embedded system software was even more fragmented with many proprietary and application specific software architectures in use 
while embedded developers could take advantage of many standard microprocessor  memory and peripheral components supplied by external vendors  the lack of acceptable i o standards forced many to develop custom i o subsystems internally  placing a heavy demand on development resources 
the deployment of the pci standard was one of the catalysts for the widespread adoption of i o standards in embedded systems 
in the early s  pc and server manufacturers developed pci  a new standard hardware architecture to connect the major components of their systems at high speed 
it offered up to a one hundred times improvement in i o data transfer rates over the previous architectures 
by the mid s  pci became the most widely used bus architecture in the pc market 
consequently  many suppliers of peripheral semiconductor components used in pcs adopted pci as the standard system interface 
in addition to penetrating the pc and server market  pci is now established as a standard i o architecture for many high performance embedded systems because it allows the use of low cost and state of the art peripheral semiconductor components developed for the pc market and provides a foundation for embedded system interoperability 
pci also offers equivalent or superior performance to the in house developed standards of many embedded equipment suppliers 
furthermore  the use of pci enables faster time to market  lower development cost and the ability to quickly integrate new i o components 
new standards are emerging to meet increasing system performance needs 
pci x  a standard now widely used in servers  is an evolutionary improvement to pci 
hypertransport is an interconnect standard used in some communications and server applications and supported in processors from amd  broadcom and pmc sierra 
rapid i o is an interconnect standard for some high performance ibm powerpc and motorola powerpc processors 
pci express is a next generation pci standard now in a development phase 
other standards  such as infiniband and ethernet  are also used in varying degrees to interconnect system components 
although the pci and newer interconnect standards have resolved many development issues relating to i o hardware architectures  software remains a challenge 
the lack of standards for i o control software and the wide use of proprietary operating systems place a significant demand on development resources 
consequently  embedded developers are increasingly adopting standard operating systems with well defined i o structures as opposed to developing their own software internally 
examples include vxworks  linux  psos  windows ce  and windows nt 

table of contents need for standard i o interconnect products and comprehensive i o solutions even with standard i o specifications  design teams must still create the circuitry and related software that implements these specifications 
designers must also update their i o subsystems to include frequent improvements in these specifications 
instead of developing all the hardware and software technology internally  systems developers seek to focus their scarce engineering resources on the proprietary features of their products 
by using standard semiconductor devices in the i o subsystem instead of custom designed devices they are able to implement the basic framework of the system more easily and thereby reduce the i o subsystem design effort thereby providing faster time to market and lower development cost 
standard products allow the design teams to concentrate their efforts on differentiating hardware and software features 
in addition to standard interconnect semiconductor devices  system designers can benefit from several other design elements  such as data control software  hardware design kits and third party development tools to complete their development work in a timely manner 
these additional elements simplify development and improve time to market 
they provide design teams with proven hardware and software design examples and the tools to adapt these examples to their needs 
due to the availability and adoption of i o standards by embedded system  server and pc developers  there is now a large demand for i o subsystem components based on these standards 
the plx solution plx develops and supplies interconnect semiconductor devices and supporting hardware and software platforms that accelerate and manage the transfer of data in high performance embedded systems and servers and pc adapter cards 
our solution consists of three related products interconnect semiconductor devices  software development kits which assist in developing systems that incorporate our semiconductor devices  and hardware design kits that allow development of a system using our semiconductor devices and software development kits 
development tools provided by third parties support these three related products 
our products are designed for use in a variety of applications including networking and telecommunications  enterprise storage  imaging and industrial 
our chips are highly integrated  cost effective semiconductor devices that optimize the flow of data and simplify the development of high performance i o subsystems 
our software development kits and hardware design kits promote sales of our semiconductor devices by lowering customers development costs and allowing them to bring new products to market more quickly 
plx products shipping today provide i o connectivity solutions for mainly the pci standard 
as new i o standards evolve  we expect to support them where appropriate 
in  we announced and started sampling a hypertransport to pci x interconnect chip 
we are in the process of developing chips that implement the pci express standard 
more than  electronic equipment manufacturers use plx semiconductor devices in a wide variety of embedded systems applications 
strategy our objective is to continue to expand our market position as a developer and supplier of i o connectivity solutions for high performance systems 
key elements of our strategy include the following 
table of contents focus on high growth markets 
we focus on the high growth communications infrastructure equipment market 
within this market  there are many highly differentiated applications with different design criteria such as product function  performance  cost  power consumption  software  size limitations and design support 
the requirements of many of these differentiated applications are addressed by our products  and we target those applications where we believe we can attain a leadership position 
deliver comprehensive solutions 
our products provide embedded systems developers with a comprehensive  proven development environment to simplify i o subsystem design  enhance performance  reduce development costs and accelerate time to market 
this solution consists of semiconductor devices  software development kits and hardware design kits 
these design elements are supported by development tools provided by third parties 
extend i o subsystem technology 
we offer our customers highly integrated semiconductor devices and related software that incorporate many of the latest advances in i o interconnect technology 
our semiconductor devices and software are designed to enable quick adoption of new i o technologies and enhancements to existing i o standards 
we seek to integrate additional i o related functions into our semiconductor devices to provide our customers with increasing functionality at the same or lower costs 
we employ a team of engineers with expertise in system architectures  product definition  semiconductor and software design and engineering to maintain our i o subsystem technology advantages 
drive i o subsystem standards for embedded applications 
we believe that our understanding of i o technology trends and market requirements allows us to bring to market more quickly new products that support the latest i o technologies 
through our participation in key industry groups responsible for standards such as the pci special interest group  the pci industrial computer manufacturer s group picmg  pci x manufacturers group  hypertransport consortium  and the arapahoe working group pci express  we have taken an active role in defining new i o standards 
strengthen and expand industry relationships 
we work with industry leaders in developing hardware and software development tools and marketing programs that promote the use of each company s products and promoting industry standards 
partners include amd  broadcom  bustronics  intel  jungo  kaparel  microsoft  motorola  pigeon point  pmc sierra  rambus  texas instruments and wind river 
as a result of these relationships  we enable embedded systems designers to choose the best products for their particular applications while still employing our product as the core of their i o subsystem design 
customers we supply our products to customers for a wide variety of high performance communications infrastructure applications including networking  telecommunications  and enterprise storage 
we also have sales in other markets such as the imaging  industrial  personal computer  and server and consumer markets 
the typical product life cycle of a high performance embedded system is one to two years or more of product development and initial marketing activity followed by two to five years or more of volume production  assuming the product is successful in the market 
the embedded system design team typically selects the sole source hardware and software components early in the design cycle 
generally  the embedded system will incorporate these same components throughout its product life because changes require an expensive re engineering effort 
therefore  when our products are designed into an embedded system  they are likely to be used in that system throughout its two to five year or more production life 
our products are standard semiconductor devices that may be incorporated into equipment used in several of our target markets 
more than electronic equipment manufacturers incorporate our semiconductor devices in their products

development tools provided by third parties support these three design elements 
the sales of these semiconductor devices account for a majority of our revenues 
we generate less than two percent of our revenues from sales of our software and hardware design kits 
the other layers of our solution promote sales of our semiconductor devices by lowering customers development costs allowing them to bring new products to market more quickly 
i o accelerators 
our i o accelerators are semiconductor devices that accelerate movement of data across a pci bus and between one or more devices or subsystems that need to communicate across the pci bus 
these products incorporate the data pipe architecture technology  a set of circuits and features that enable an efficient flow of data within systems with minimal supervision from the system processor 
our i o accelerators address a range of applications and provide flexible interfaces that allow them to connect to a wide variety of semiconductor devices  including processors such as ibm s and motorola s powerpc  intel s i and strong arm  hitachi s sh  and motorola s k series 
customers also use these semiconductor devices in connection with digital signal processors  or dsps  from texas instruments and others 
the i o accelerators can be connected with a wide range of peripheral devices  including lan  wan  disk control and graphics 
hypertransport interconnect bridges 
the hypertransport bridge allows a processor  typically a mips processor  to generate and control two pci x buses 
the bridge chip converts the or bit mhz hypertransport processor interface to two bit mhz pci x buses 
the bridge provides a means for the processor to communicate efficiently with multiple i o devices such as ethernet controllers 
this product  now in the sampling stage  is a result of an agreement we entered into in may with advanced micro devices amd 
software development kits 
our software development kits  or sdks  are designed to simplify and accelerate the development of systems that incorporate our semiconductor devices 
support is provided for several 
table of contents industry leading operating systems  including vxworks from wind river  linux  and microsoft windows as well as generic applications and other operating systems 
the sdks include an application programming interface  or api  that enables developers to execute complex transactions with simple commands 
this programming interface allows customers to migrate their designs  with the same software interface  from our existing bit i o accelerators to our bit i o accelerators 
this common interface allows customers to preserve their software investment even as their designs evolve in complexity and as new i o architectures are deployed 
hardware design kits 
we offer hardware design kits that support the development of systems incorporating plx semiconductor devices 
we call our hardware design kits rapid development kits  or rdks 
designers use the rdks to evaluate our semiconductor devices and to simplify and accelerate product development 
each hardware design kit includes a development circuit board that designers can use to evaluate the plx products and also design their own system 
these hardware design kits also include technical drawings  documentation and other design assistance tools 
to offer additional design support  we work with third party companies that provide development tools for our customers 
although we receive no revenue directly from these development tools  they promote sales of our semiconductor devices because these tools often make it easier to develop systems incorporating our products 
examples include software development tools from jungo  microsoft  pigeon point  and wind river and software modeling tools from synopsys 
our principal product offerings and functions include the following category product description semiconductor devices bit mhz target i o accelerators pci pci pci enables connection of  and bit peripherals and personal computer adapters to pci bit mhz master i o accelerators pci pci pci sd pci es pci provides the flexibility to connect with a wide range of processors  peripherals and memory bridges ht connects microprocessor hypertransport interface to two pci x buses and bit mhz i o accelerators pci pci provides the flexibility to connect with a wide range of microprocessors  peripherals and memory 
table of contents software development kits pci software sdk provides tools for accelerating design of data transport software includes development and debugging utilities  sample firmware and drivers hardware design kits rapid development kits kits supporting a range of products include development circuit boards  sdk software  documentation and schematics to assist system development technology we believe that supplying high performance connectivity solutions for i o subsystems requires expertise in four areas semiconductor design  software technology  system design  and industry standards 
semiconductor design 
our engineers have substantial expertise in semiconductor design and have developed a comprehensive library of complex functional blocks for use in semiconductor devices for i o connectivity 
as a result of this expertise  we offer both innovative architectures and high levels of functionality 
for example  our proprietary data pipe architecture technology allows the system developer a high degree of control over the pci bus in order to address specific design needs 
in high performance systems  the data pipe architecture technology enables data throughput that is faster than typical approaches 
we continue to integrate more functionality in our semiconductor devices to reduce cost  improve performance  reduce size and simplify the customer s design effort 
software technology 
we devote engineering resources to the development of software technology used to assist the system developer in debugging hardware and creating data control software 
the quality and availability of these tools are key differentiating factors between plx and competing alternatives 
we continue to enhance and expand our software development kits  which contain a set of programming interfaces that simplify the development of software 
our software expertise provides us with valuable insights into our customers software development issues  which aids the definition and development of future semiconductor devices 
system design 
we employ a team of system level design engineers that develop hardware design kits 
these kits are high performance adapters and embedded systems that customers can use to assist development of their products 
each of these hardware design kits is a system or adapter similar in complexity to those built by our customers 
the system design experience provides us valuable insights which we can use to improve future semiconductor device and software products 
industry standards 
through our participation in the key industry groups responsible for interconnect standards  we take an active role in defining new i o standards such as pci x  hypertransport  and pci express 

table of contents competition competition in the semiconductor industry is intense 
if our target markets continue to grow  the number of competitors may increase significantly 
in addition  new semiconductor technologies may lead to new products that can perform similar functions as our products 
competition in the various markets we serve comes from companies of various sizes  many of which are significantly larger and have greater financial and other resources 
thus they can better withstand adverse economic or market conditions 
our principal products compete with standard products from companies such as alliance semiconductor  applied micro circuits  cypress semiconductor  exar  marvel technology group  oxford semiconductor and tundra semiconductor 
in addition  two alternative devices can perform some or all of the functions of our semiconductor devices 
the first is the application specific integrated circuit  or asic 
with the asic approach  a customer creates a custom semiconductor device for a particular application 
because the customer buys the asic directly from the semiconductor foundry  this approach may lead to lower unit production costs 
however  this approach entails a large initial time and resource investment in developing the custom device 
the second alternative device is the field programmable gate array  or fpga 
the fpga is a semiconductor device whose logic function can be programmed by the system manufacturer 
this requires less design effort and time than the asic approach 
however  because of the additional circuitry required to enable the device to be programmed  this approach typically entails higher unit production costs which can be prohibitive compared to asics or standard semiconductor devices 
nevertheless  fpga prices have decreased steadily and in many cases are competitive with prices for standard semiconductor devices 
accordingly  we also experience competition from leading asic suppliers  including ibm  lsi logic  nec  and toshiba as well as from fpga suppliers  including altera  atmel  lattice  quicklogic  and xilinx 
many of these competitors are large companies that have significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than plx 
we believe that the principal factors of competition in our business include functionality  product performance  price  product innovation  availability of development tools  customer service and reliability 
we believe that we compete favorably with respect to each of these factors 
we differentiate our products from those of our competitors by incorporating innovative features that allow our customers to build systems based on industry standards that are more efficient and higher in performance 
furthermore  in general  our software and hardware development tools are more comprehensive than competing solutions 
however  we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors  and increased competition may adversely affect our business 
sales  marketing and technical support our sales and marketing strategy is to achieve design wins at leading embedded systems companies in high growth market segments 
we market and sell our products in the united states through a combination of direct regional sales managers and a network of independent manufacturers representatives 
we maintain united states direct sales offices in california  connecticut  north carolina  texas and wisconsin 
outside the united states  we have engaged a team of manufacturers representatives  stocking representatives and distributors to sell and market our products 
our international network includes representatives in australia  belgium  canada  denmark  france  germany  hong kong  ireland  israel  japan  korea  norway  people s republic of china  singapore  south africa  sweden  taiwan  the netherlands  and the united kingdom 
we maintain a direct sales office in the united kingdom to service customers in europe and the middle east and in japan and hong kong to service japan  southeast asia  and people s republic of china

cisco and ibm have historically and continue to be significant customers 
the majority of our sales to cisco and ibm are sold through am and metatech  both distributors  and celestica  a contract manufacturer 
technical support to customers is provided through field and factory applications engineers  technical marketing personnel and  if necessary  product design engineers 
local field support is provided in person or by telephone 
we also use our world wide web site to provide product documentation and technical support information 
we believe that providing customers with comprehensive product support is critical to remaining competitive in the markets we serve 
in addition  our close contact with customer design engineers provides valuable input into existing product enhancements and next generation product specifications 
research and development our future success will depend to a large extent on our ability to rapidly develop and introduce new products and enhancements to our existing products that meet emerging industry standards and satisfy changing customer requirements 
we have made and expect to continue to make substantial investments in research and development and to participate in the development of new and existing industry standards 
our research and development has focused on three main areas semiconductor devices  hardware design kits and software development kits 
the majority of our engineers are involved in semiconductor device development  with the remaining engineers working on software and reference design hardware 
before development of a new product commences  our marketing managers work closely with research and development engineers and customers to develop a comprehensive requirements specification 
in addition  our marketing managers and engineers review the applicable industry standards and incorporate desired changes into the new product specification 
after the product is designed and commercially available  our engineers continue to work with various customers on specific design issues to understand emerging requirements that may be incorporated into future product generations or product upgrades 
our research and development expenditures totaled million in  million in  and million in research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs of employees engaged in research  design  and development activities 
in addition  expenses for outside engineering consultants  non recurring engineering at our independent foundries  and deferred compensation are included in research and development expenses 
as of december   there were employees engaged in research and development 
we perform our research and development activities at our headquarters in sunnyvale  california and in salt lake city  utah 
we periodically seek to hire additional skilled development engineers  who are currently in short supply 
our business could be adversely affected if we encounter delays in hiring additional engineers 
see certain factors that may affect future operating results failure to hire additional personnel and to improve our operations will limit our growth 
our future performance depends on a number of factors  including our ability to identify emerging technology trends in our target markets  define and develop competitive new products in a timely manner  enhance existing products to differentiate them from those of competitors and bring products to market at competitive prices 
the technical innovations and product development required for us to remain competitive are inherently complex and require long development cycles 
we typically must incur substantial research and development costs before the technical feasibility and commercial viability of a product can be ascertained 
we must also continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to continually enhance the performance and functionality of our products to keep pace with competitive products and customer demands for improved 
table of contents performance 
revenues from future products or product enhancements may not be sufficient to recover the development costs associated with these products or enhancements 
the failure to successfully develop new products on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business 
see certain factors that may affect future operating results rapid technological change could make our products obsolete 
manufacturing we have adopted a fabless semiconductor manufacturing model and outsource all of our semiconductor manufacturing  assembly and testing 
this approach allows us to focus our resources on the design  development and marketing of products and significantly reduces our capital requirements 
we subcontract substantially all of our semiconductor manufacturing to amd  ibm in the united states  samsung in korea  seiko epson semiconductor in japan  and taiwan semiconductor manufacturing corporation in taiwan 
none of our products are currently manufactured by more than one supplier  and all of our products are expected to be single source manufactured for the foreseeable future 
we must place orders two to four months in advance of expected delivery of finished goods 
we maintain inventory levels based on current lead times from foundries plus safety stock to account for unanticipated fluctuations in demand 
our inventory comprises a large portion of our working capital 
as a result  we have limited ability to react to fluctuations in demand for our products  which could cause us to have an excess or a shortage of inventory of a particular product and reduced product revenues 
in the event of a loss of  or a decision by us to change a key supplier or foundry  qualifying a new supplier or foundry and commencing volume production would likely involve delay and expenses  resulting in lost revenues  reduced operating margins and possible detriment to customer relationships 
since we place our orders on a purchase order basis and do not have a long term volume purchase agreement with any of our existing suppliers  any of these suppliers may allocate capacity to the production of other products while reducing deliveries to us on short notice 
while we believe we currently have good relationships with our foundries and adequate capacity to support our current sales levels  there can be no assurance that adequate foundry capacity will be available in the future on acceptable terms  if at all 
see certain factors that may affect future operating results our independent manufacturers may not be able to meet our manufacturing requirements 
our semiconductor devices are currently fabricated using a range of semiconductor manufacturing processes 
we must continuously develop our devices using more advanced processes to remain competitive on a cost and performance basis 
migrating to new technologies is a challenging task requiring new design skills  methods and tools 
we believe that the transition of our products to smaller geometries will be important for us to remain competitive 
our business could be materially adversely affected if any transition to new processes is delayed or inefficiently implemented 
see certain factors that may affect future operating results defects in our products could increase our costs and delay our product shipments 
intellectual property our future success and competitive position depend upon our ability to obtain and maintain the proprietary technology used in our principal products 
most of our current products include implementations of the pci industry standard  which is available to other companies 
we currently have no patents on any of our i o accelerator products and rely instead on trade secret protection 
we hold two patents on switch technology that expire in december in addition  we have two patents on i o buffer and clock technology that expire in september and september in the future  we plan to seek patent protection when we believe it is necessary 
our existing or future patents may be invalidated  circumvented  challenged or licensed to others 
the rights granted may not provide competitive advantages to us 
in addition  our future patent applications may not be issued with the scope of the claims sought by us  if at all 
furthermore  others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology  duplicate our technology or design around the patents owned or licensed by us 
in addition  effective patent  trademark  copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in foreign countries where we may need this protection 
we cannot be sure that steps taken by us to protect our technology will prevent misappropriation of our technology 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights or positions 
this often results in significant and often protracted and expensive litigation 
there is no 
table of contents intellectual property litigation currently pending against us 
however  we may from time to time receive notifications of claims that we may be infringing patents or other intellectual property rights owned by other third parties 
if it is necessary or desirable  we may seek licenses under these third party patents or intellectual property rights 
however  we cannot be sure that licenses will be offered or that the terms of any offered licenses will be acceptable to us 
the failure to obtain a license from a third party for technology used by us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend the manufacture or shipment of products or our use of processes requiring the technology 
litigation could result in significant expenses to us  adversely affect sales of the challenged product or technology and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel  whether or not the litigation is determined in our favor 
in the event of an adverse result in any litigation  we could be required to pay substantial damages  cease the manufacture  use  sale or importation of infringing products  expend significant resources to develop or acquire non infringing technology  and discontinue the use of processes requiring the infringing technology or obtain licenses to the infringing technology 
in addition  we may not be successful in developing or acquiring the necessary licenses under reasonable terms 
this could require expenditures by us of substantial time and other resources 
any of these developments would have a material adverse effect on our business 
see certain factors that may affect future operating results our limited ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights could adversely affect our competitive position

see factors that may affect future operating results below  as well as such other risks and uncertainties as are detailed in our securities and exchange commission reports and filings for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
overview plx was founded in  and since we have focused on development of i o interface semiconductors and related software and development tools that are used in systems incorporating the pci standard 
in and  a significant portion of our revenues was from the sale of semiconductor devices that perform similar functions as our current products  except they were based on a variety of industry standards 
our revenues since have been derived predominantly from the sale of semiconductor devices based on the pci standard to a large number of customers in a variety of applications including networking and telecommunications  enterprise storage  imaging  industrial and other embedded applications as well as in related adapter cards 
we generate less than of our revenues from sales of our software and development tools 
we utilize a fabless semiconductor business model whereby we purchase packaged and tested semiconductor devices from independent manufacturing foundries 
this approach allows us to focus on defining  developing  and marketing our products and eliminates the need for us to invest large amounts of capital in manufacturing facilities and work in process inventory 
we rely on a combination of direct sales personnel and distributors and manufacturers representatives throughout the world to sell a significant portion of our products 
we pay manufacturers representatives a commission on sales while we sell products to distributors at a discount from the selling price 
we generally recognize revenue at the time of title passage 
recognition of sales to distributors  including international distributors  is deferred until the product is resold by the distributors to end users 
see certain factors that may affect future operating results a large portion of our revenues is derived from sales to third party distributors who may terminate their relationships with us at any time 

table of contents our gross margins have fluctuated in the past and are expected to fluctuate in the future due to changes in product mix  write downs and recoveries of excess or obsolete inventory  the position of our products in their respective life cycles  and specific product manufacturing costs 
the time period between initial customer evaluation and design completion can range from six to twelve months or more 
furthermore  there is typically an additional six to twelve month or greater period after design completion before a customer commences volume production of equipment incorporating our products 
due to these lengthy sales cycles  we may experience significant fluctuations in new orders from month to month 
in addition  we typically make inventory purchases prior to receiving customer orders 
consequently  if anticipated sales and shipments in any quarter do not occur when expected  expenses and inventory levels could be disproportionately high  and our results for that quarter and potentially future quarters would be materially and adversely affected 
the supply of semiconductors can quickly and unexpectedly match or exceed demand because customer end demand can change very quickly and semiconductor suppliers can rapidly increase production output 
this can lead to a sudden oversupply situation and a subsequent reduction in order rates and revenues as customers adjust their inventories to true demand rates 
customers continuously adjust their inventories resulting in frequent changes in demand for our products 
the semiconductor industry experienced such a change in the supply and demand situation during and in late and during  customers in the high speed communications end market  and the contract manufacturing firms that serve this market  adjusted their demand on component suppliers as they coped with high levels of inventory and sharply reduced demand for their end products 
in addition  the slowing of global economic growth during led to lower order rates from customers serving the telecommunications  industrial and computer end markets as they adjusted to lower demand for their products 
the decline in order rates resulted in a sequential decline in our revenues for and the rapid build up of semiconductor inventories in global sales channels resulted in reduced lead times for components during and relative to previous years 
the perceived overabundance of semiconductors combined with uncertain demand for their end products led our customers to move to a just in time order pattern as they worked to reduce inventories 
due to the combination of excess supply  reduced demand and lower lead times  orders rates declined during and customers appear to be placing orders on an as needed basis due to short supplier lead times combined with the uncertain macroeconomic outlook 
the low backlog and uncertainty of customer demand significantly limits our ability to predict future levels of sales and profitability 
in may  we purchased sebring systems  a development stage company that was developing a switched pci product 
in connection with this acquisition  we issued an aggregate of  shares of our common stock in return for the capital stock of sebring systems 
in addition  outstanding options of sebring systems were converted into options to purchase our common stock 
the transaction was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
our long term success will depend on our ability to introduce new products 
while new products typically generate little or no revenues during the first twelve months following their introduction  our revenues in subsequent periods depend upon these new products 
due to the lengthy sales cycle and additional time for customers to commence volume production  significant revenues from our new products typically occur only twelve to twenty four months after product introduction 
as a result  revenues from newly introduced products have  in the past  produced a small percentage of our total revenues in the year the product was introduced 
see certain factors that may affect future operating results our lengthy sales cycle can result in uncertainty and delays with regard to our expected revenues 
results of operations the following table summarizes historical results of operations as a percentage of net revenues for the periods shown 

table of contents fiscal year ended december  net revenues cost of revenues gross margin expenses research and development selling  general and administrative amortization of goodwill and purchased intangible assets in process research and development total operating expenses operating loss interest income and other  net loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net loss comparison of years ended december    and net revenues 
net revenues consist of product revenues generated principally by sales of our semiconductor devices 
net revenues decreased by million or to million for from million for the decrease was primarily due to reduced demand from a significant customer  prediwave  as well as lower overall unit shipments in prediwave used our product in their set top boxes targeted for sale in china 
we completed our last shipment to prediwave in the first quarter of in and  prediwave accounted for million and million  respectively  of our net revenues 
excluding sales to prediwave  revenues decreased to million for from million for net revenues decreased by million or to million in from million for in  the decrease was primarily due to lower unit shipments resulting from the economic slowdown in the technology sector 
gross margin

research and development expenses 
research and development r d expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs of employees engaged in research  design  and development activities 
in addition  expenses for outside engineering consultants  non recurring engineering at our independent foundries  and deferred compensation are included in r d expenses 

table of contents r d expenses decreased million or to million for from million for r d expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to for from for the decrease in r d expenses in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to lower headcount and deferred compensation expense 
r d expenses increased million or to million for from million for r d expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to for from for the increase in r d expenses in absolute dollars was primarily due to the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products 
the increase in r d expenses as a percentage of revenues was due to increased r d spending coupled with the decrease in revenues from to selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses consist primarily of employee related expenses  professional fees  trade show and other promotional expenses  as well as sales commissions to manufacturers representatives 
sg a expenses decreased million or to million for from million for sg a expenses decreased million or to million for from million for in and  the decreases in absolute dollars were primarily due to decreases in sales commissions to manufacturers representatives as a result of lower revenues  decreases in discretionary spending and lower headcount

amortization of goodwill and purchased intangible assets decreased by million or to million for from million for in  the decrease was due to the impact of sfas no 
 whereby we discontinued the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles beginning january  amortization of goodwill and purchased intangible assets increased by million or to million for from million for in  the increase was due to the fact that sebring systems was purchased in may and therefore  a full year of amortization was recorded in compared to seven months in amortization of goodwill and purchased intangible assets includes the amortization of goodwill and other purchased intangible assets relating to the may acquisition of sebring systems 
we will continue to amortize the related patents acquired in connection with the sebring acquisition through may for a more detailed description of sfas no 
and its effect on us  see recent accounting pronouncements 
in process research and development 
during  we incurred a one time charge of million for in process research and development relating to our acquisition of sebring systems  inc completed in see note to the consolidated financial statements 
deferred compensation 
we recorded deferred compensation of million related to stock options granted below fair market value to employees in relation to the acquisition of sebring systems in may additionally  we recorded deferred compensation of million in connection with the grant of stock options below fair market value to our employees in september the amount of deferred compensation is presented as a reduction of stockholders equity and amortized ratably over the vesting period of the applicable stock grants 
amortization of deferred compensation recorded in   and  was million  million  and million  respectively 
the million decrease in deferred compensation from to is due to lower headcount 
substantially all of these amounts are included in research and development expenses 
we expect to record compensation expenses related to deferred compensation of approximately million per quarter through september  interest income 
interest income reflects interest earned on average cash  cash equivalents and short term and long term investment balances 
interest income decreased to million for from million for interest income decreased to million in from million for the decrease from to was primarily due to lower interest rates 
the decrease from to was primarily due to interest earned on lower cash and investments balances and lower interest rates 

table of contents interest expense 
interest expense reflects interest charges relating to our november loan of million from wells capital management in connection with our purchase of the sunnyvale  california facility 
there was no interest expense in as this loan was repaid in full in august in and  interest expense totaled million and million  respectively 
other income expense 
other income expense remained relatively flat at million for and compared to an expense of  for the increase from to was primarily due to rental income of million from a tenant in our facilities 
the lease for this tenant expired in january and the tenant has chosen not to renew the lease 
should we fail to find a new tenant  we expect other income to decrease by approximately million in provision for income taxes 
income tax expense for the period ended december  was  on a pretax loss of million  compared to an income tax benefit of million on pretax loss of million and income tax expense of million on pretax loss of million for the periods ended december  and  respectively 
our income tax expense differs from the expected benefit derived by applying the applicable us federal statutory rate to the loss from operations primarily due to non deductible charges for the amortization of deferred compensation and the recording of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset partially offset by the benefit of research and development tax credits 
our income tax benefit differs from the expected benefit derived by applying the applicable us federal statutory rate to the loss from operations primarily due to non deductible charges for the amortization of goodwill and deferred compensation partially offset by tax benefits related to prior years of  our income tax expense differs from the expected benefit derived by applying the applicable us federal statutory rate to the loss from operations primarily due to non deductible charges for the amortization of goodwill and purchased intangible assets partially offset by the benefit of research and development tax credits 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents and short and long term investments were million at december   an increase of million from million at december  the increase was primarily due to the following a net loss of million adjusted for non cash expenses of million  a decrease in accounts receivable and inventories of million and million  respectively  and million in cash received from the exercise of stock options 
such increases were partially offset by an increase in other assets of million and the use of cash totaling million in repurchasing approximately million shares of our common stock in accordance with our stock repurchase program 
in january  our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program whereby up to  shares of our common stock could be purchased in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
as of september   all  shares had been repurchased 
in september  our board of directors approved a second stock repurchase program whereby an additional  shares of our common stock may be purchased in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
as of december   approximately  shares had been repurchased pursuant to this second program 
we believe that our existing resources  together with cash generated from our operations will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the inventory levels we maintain  the level of investment we make in new technologies and improvements to existing technologies and the levels of monthly expenses required to launch new products 
from time to time  we may also evaluate potential acquisitions and equity investments complementary to our technologies and market strategies 
to the extent that existing resources and future earnings are insufficient to fund our future activities  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private financings 
additional funds may not be available or  if available  we may not be able to obtain them on terms favorable to us and our stockholders 
as of december   we had no off balance sheet financing arrangements

table of contents payments due in total operating leases facilities software licenses inventory purchase commitments total cash obligations see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
the sec has defined a company s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on this definition  we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below 
we also have other key accounting policies which involve the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results 
for additional information see note organization and summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
although we believe that our estimates  assumptions and judgments are reasonable  they are based upon information presently available 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions  judgments or conditions 
inventory write downs 
we evaluate the write downs for inventory based on a combination of factors 
based on the life of the product  sales history  obsolescence  and sales forecast  we record write downs ranging from to 
any adverse changes to our future product demand may result in increased write downs  resulting in decreased gross margin 
in addition  future sales on any of our previously written down inventory may result in increased gross margin 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on length of time the receivables are past due 
we record reserves for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
we have certain customers with individually large amounts due at any given balance sheet date 
any unanticipated change in one of those customer s credit worthiness or other matters affecting the collectibility of amounts due from such customers could have a material affect on our results of operations in the period in which such changes or events occur 
goodwill 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we adopted statement of financial accounting standard no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets on january  this standard requires that goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized  but rather are reviewed for impairment annually  or more frequently if certain indicators arise 
although at december   no impairment of goodwill has been recognized  it is reasonably possible that assumptions upon which the recoverability of goodwill were based could differ in the future 
in that event  impairment charges could be required 
taxes 
we account for income taxes using the liability method 
deferred taxes are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities  using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
as of december   we recorded a valuation allowance for the entire deferred tax asset as a result of uncertainties regarding the realization of the asset balance see note to the consolidated financial statements 
future taxable income and or tax 
table of contents planning strategies may eliminate all or a portion of the need for the valuation allowance 
in the event we determine we are able to realize our deferred tax asset  an adjustment to the valuation allowance may increase income in the period such determination is made

all forward looking statements included in this document are based on information available to the company on the date hereof  and the company assumes no obligation to update any such forward looking statements 
it is important to note that the company s actual results could differ materially from those included in such forward looking statements 
these cautionary statements should be considered in the context of the factors listed below  as well as those disclosed from time to time in the company s reports on forms q and k 
risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described herein include the following our operating results may fluctuate significantly due to factors which are not within our control our quarterly operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and are expected to fluctuate significantly in the future based on a number of factors  many of which are not under our control 
our operating expenses  which include product development costs and selling  general and administrative expenses  are relatively fixed in the short term 
if our revenues are lower than we expect because we sell fewer semiconductor devices  
table of contents delay the release of new products or the announcement of new features  or for other reasons  we may not be able to quickly reduce our spending in response 
other circumstances that can affect our operating results include the timing of significant orders  order cancellations and reschedulings  the loss of a significant customer s  our significant customers could lose market share that may affect our business  general economic conditions  our ability to develop  introduce and market new products and technologies on a timely basis  changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors or suppliers  including decreases in unit average selling prices of our products  introduction of products and technologies by our competitors  shifts in our product mix toward lower margin products  the availability of production capacity at the fabrication facilities that manufacture our products  the availability and cost of materials to our suppliers  and political climate 
these factors are difficult to forecast  and these or other factors could adversely affect our business 
any shortfall in our revenues would have a direct impact on our business 
in addition  fluctuations in our quarterly results could adversely affect the market price of our common stock in a manner unrelated to our long term operating performance 
our results of operations have been adversely affected by the ongoing slowdown in the global economy over the past year  the global economy has been experiencing a slowdown due to many factors  including decreased consumer confidence  unemployment  the ongoing threat and cost of terrorism and reduced corporate profits and capital spending 
as a result of these unfavorable economic conditions  we continue to experience reduced customer order rates 
if these economic conditions in the united states continue or worsen or if a wider or global economic slowdown occurs  our business  financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 
because a substantial portion of our net sales is generated by a small number of large customers  if any of these customers delays or reduces its orders  our net revenues and earnings will be harmed historically  a relatively small number of customers have accounted for a significant portion of our net revenues in any particular period 
in  sales to am  a distributor  accounted for of our net revenues 
in  sales to prediwave  a direct customer  and am and unique  both distributors  accounted for  and  respectively 
in  sales to unique and am accounted for and  respectively 
no other customer accounted for more than of net revenues in any period presented 
cisco and ibm have historically and continue to be significant customers 
the majority of our sales to cisco and ibm are sold through am and metatech  our distributors  and celestica  a contract manufacturer 

table of contents we have no long term volume purchase commitments from any of our significant customers 
we cannot be certain that our current customers will continue to place orders with us  that orders by existing customers will continue at the levels of previous periods or that we will be able to obtain orders from new customers 
for example  a major customer  prediwave  significantly reduced their demand in prediwave used our product in their set top boxes targeted for sale in china 
we completed our last shipment to prediwave in the first quarter of in and  prediwave accounted for million and million  respectively  of our net revenues 
in addition  some of our customers supply products to end market purchasers and any of these end market purchasers could choose to reduce or eliminate orders for our customers products 
this would in turn lower our customers orders for our products 
we anticipate that sales of our products to a relatively small number of customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our net sales 
due to these factors  the following have in the past and may in the future reduce our net sales or earnings the reduction  delay or cancellation of orders from one or more of our significant customers  the selection of competing products or in house design by one or more of our current customers  the loss of one or more of our current customers  or a failure of one or more of our current customers to pay our invoices 
our lengthy sales cycle can result in uncertainty and delays with regard to our expected revenues our customers typically perform numerous tests and extensively evaluate our products before incorporating them into their systems 
the time required for test  evaluation and design of our products into a customer s equipment can range from six to twelve months or more 
it can take an additional six to twelve months or more before a customer commences volume shipments of equipment that incorporates our products 
because of this lengthy sales cycle  we may experience a delay between the time when we increase expenses for research and development and sales and marketing efforts and the time when we generate higher revenues  if any  from these expenditures 
in addition  the delays inherent in our lengthy sales cycle raise additional risks of customer decisions to cancel or change product plans 
when we achieve a design win  there can be no assurance that the customer will ultimately ship products incorporating our products 
our business could be materially adversely affected if a significant customer curtails  reduces or delays orders during our sales cycle or chooses not to release products incorporating our products 
rapid technological change could make our products obsolete we operate in an industry that is subject to evolving industry standards  rapid technological changes  rapid changes in customer demands and the rapid introduction of new  higher performance products with shorter product life cycles 
as a result  we expect to continue to make significant investments in research and development 
however  we may not have adequate funds from operations or otherwise to devote to research and development  forcing us to reduce our research and development efforts 
also  we must manage product transitions successfully  since announcements or introductions of new products by us or our competitors could adversely affect sales of our existing products because these existing products can become obsolete or unmarketable for specific purposes 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new products or enhancements to our existing products on a timely basis or in a manner which satisfies customer needs or achieves widespread market acceptance 
any significant delay in releasing new products could adversely affect our reputation  give a competitor a first to market advantage or allow a competitor to achieve greater market share 
the failure to adjust to rapid technological change could harm our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents failure of our products to gain market acceptance would adversely affect our financial condition we believe that our growth prospects depend upon our ability to gain customer acceptance of our products and technology 
market acceptance of products depends upon numerous factors  including compatibility with existing manufacturing processes and products  perceived advantages over competing products and the level of customer service available to support such products 
moreover  manufacturers often rely on a limited number of equipment vendors to meet their manufacturing equipment needs 
as a result  market acceptance of our products may be adversely affected to the extent potential customers utilize a competitor s manufacturing equipment 
there can be no assurance that growth in sales of new products will continue or that we will be successful in obtaining broad market acceptance of our products and technology 
we expect to spend a significant amount of time and resources to develop new products and refine existing products 
in light of the long product development cycles inherent in our industry  these expenditures will be made well in advance of the prospect of deriving revenues from the sale of any new products 
our ability to commercially introduce and successfully market any new products is subject to a wide variety of challenges during this development cycle  including start up bugs  design defects and other matters that could delay introduction of these products to the marketplace 
in addition  since our customers are not obligated by long term contracts to purchase our products  our anticipated product orders may not materialize  or orders that do materialize may be cancelled 
as a result  if we do not achieve market acceptance of new products  we may not be able to realize sufficient sales of our products in order to recoup research and development expenditures 
the failure of any of our new products to achieve market acceptance would harm our business  financial condition  results of operation and cash flows 
we must make significant research and development expenditures prior to generating revenues from products to establish market acceptance of a new semiconductor device  we must dedicate significant resources to research and development  production and sales and marketing 
we incur substantial costs in developing  manufacturing and selling a new product  which often significantly precede meaningful revenues from the sale of this product 
consequently  new products can require significant time and investment to achieve profitability 
investors should note that our efforts to introduce new semiconductor devices or other products or services may not be successful or profitable 
in addition  products or technologies developed by others may render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive 
we record as expenses the costs related to the development of new semiconductor devices and other products as these expenses are incurred 
as a result  our profitability from quarter to quarter and from year to year may be adversely affected by the number and timing of our new product launches in any period and the level of acceptance gained by these products 
our independent manufacturers may not be able to meet our manufacturing requirements we do not manufacture any of our semiconductor devices 
therefore  we are referred to in the semiconductor industry as a fabless producer of semiconductors 
consequently  we depend upon third party manufacturers to produce semiconductors that meet our specifications 
we currently have third party manufacturers that can produce semiconductors which meet our needs 
however  as the semiconductor industry continues to progress towards smaller manufacturing and design geometries  the complexities of producing semiconductors will increase 
decreasing geometries may introduce new problems and delays that may affect product development and deliveries 
due to the nature of the semiconductor industry and our status as a fabless semiconductor company  we could encounter fabrication related problems that may affect the availability of our semiconductor devices  delay our shipments or may increase our costs 
our reliance on single source manufacturers of our semiconductor devices could delay shipments and increase our costs none of our semiconductor devices are currently manufactured by more than one supplier 
we place our orders on a purchase order basis and do not have a long term purchase agreement with any of our existing suppliers 

table of contents in the event that the supplier of a semiconductor device was unable or unwilling to continue to manufacture this product in the required volume  we would have to identify and qualify a substitute supplier 
introducing new products or transferring existing products to a new third party manufacturer or process may result in unforeseen device specification and operating problems 
these problems may affect product shipments and may be costly to correct 
silicon fabrication capacity may also change  or the costs per silicon wafer may increase 
manufacturing related problems may have a material adverse effect on our business 
intense competition in the markets in which we operate may reduce the demand for or prices of our products competition in the semiconductor industry is intense 
if our main target market  the embedded systems market  continues to grow  the number of competitors may increase significantly 
in addition  new semiconductor technology may lead to new products that can perform similar functions as our products 
some of our competitors and other semiconductor companies may develop and introduce products that integrate into a single semiconductor device the functions performed by our semiconductor devices 
this would eliminate the need for our products in some applications 
in addition  competition in our markets comes from companies of various sizes  many of which are significantly larger and have greater financial and other resources than we do and thus can better withstand adverse economic or market conditions 
also  as we start to sell our processor products  we will compete with established embedded microprocessor companies and others 
many of these indirect competitors and microprocessor companies have significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than plx 
therefore  we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors  and increased competition may adversely affect our business 
see business competition  and products in part i of item i of this form k 
failure to have our products designed into the products of electronic equipment manufacturers will result in reduced sales our future success depends on electronic equipment manufacturers that design our semiconductor devices into their systems 
we must anticipate market trends and the price  performance and functionality requirements of current and potential future electronic equipment manufacturers and must successfully develop and manufacture products that meet these requirements 
in addition  we must meet the timing requirements of these electronic equipment manufacturers and must make products available to them in sufficient quantities 
these electronic equipment manufacturers could develop products that provide the same or similar functionality as one or more of our products and render these products obsolete in their applications 
we do not have purchase agreements with our customers that contain minimum purchase requirements 
instead  electronic equipment manufacturers purchase our products pursuant to short term purchase orders that may be canceled without charge 
we believe that in order to obtain broad penetration in the markets for our products  we must maintain and cultivate relationships  directly or through our distributors  with electronic equipment manufacturers that are leaders in the embedded systems markets 
accordingly  we will incur significant expenditures in order to build relationships with electronic equipment manufacturers prior to volume sales of new products 
if we fail to develop relationships with additional electronic equipment manufacturers to have our products designed into new embedded systems or to develop sufficient new products to replace products that have become obsolete  our business would be materially adversely affected 
lower demand for our customers products will result in lower demand for our products demand for our products depends in large part on the development and expansion of the high performance embedded systems markets including networking and telecommunications  enterprise storage  imaging and industrial applications 
the size and rate of growth of these embedded systems markets may in the future fluctuate significantly based on numerous factors 
these factors include the adoption of alternative technologies  capital spending levels and general economic conditions 
demand for products that incorporate high performance embedded systems may not grow 

table of contents defects in our products could increase our costs and delay our product shipments our products are complex 
while we test our products  these products may still have errors  defects or bugs that we find only after commercial production has begun 
we have experienced errors  defects and bugs in the past in connection with new products 
our customers may not purchase our products if the products have reliability  quality or compatibility problems 
this delay in acceptance could make it more difficult to retain our existing customers and to attract new customers 
moreover  product errors  defects or bugs could result in additional development costs  diversion of technical and other resources from our other development efforts  claims by our customers or others against us  or the loss of credibility with our current and prospective customers 
in the past  the additional time required to correct defects has caused delays in product shipments and resulted in lower revenues 
we may have to spend significant amounts of capital and resources to address and fix problems in new products 
we must continuously develop our products using new process technology with smaller geometries to remain competitive on a cost and performance basis 
migrating to new technologies is a challenging task requiring new design skills  methods and tools and is difficult to achieve 
we could lose key personnel due to competitive market conditions and attrition our success depends to a significant extent upon our senior management and key technical and sales personnel 
the loss of one or more of these employees could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we do not have employment contracts with any of our executive officers 
our success also depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified technical  sales and marketing  customer support  financial and accounting  and managerial personnel 
competition for such personnel in the semiconductor industry is intense  and we may not be able to retain our key personnel or to attract  assimilate or retain other highly qualified personnel in the future 
in addition  we may lose key personnel due to attrition  including health  family and other reasons 
we have experienced  and may continue to experience  difficulty in hiring and retaining candidates with appropriate qualifications 
if we do not succeed in hiring and retaining candidates with appropriate qualifications  our business could be materially adversely affected 
a large portion of our revenues is derived from sales to third party distributors who may terminate their relationships with us at any time we depend on distributors to sell a significant portion of our products 
in  net revenues through distributors accounted for approximately of our net revenues 
some of our distributors also market and sell competing products 
distributors may terminate their relationships with us at any time 
our future performance will depend in part on our ability to attract additional distributors that will be able to market and support our products effectively  especially in markets in which we have not previously distributed our products 
we may lose one or more of our current distributors or may not be able to recruit additional or replacement distributors 
the loss of one or more of our major distributors could have a material adverse effect on our business as we may not be successful in servicing our customers directly or through manufacturers representatives 
the demand for our products depends upon our ability to support evolving industry standards substantially all of our revenues are derived from sales of products  which rely on the pci standard 
if the embedded systems markets move away from this standard and begin using new standards  we may not be able to successfully design and manufacture new products that use these new standards 
there is also the risk that new products we develop in response to new standards may not be accepted in the market 
in addition  the pci standard is continuously evolving  and we may not be able to modify our products to address new pci specifications 
any of these events would have a material adverse effect on our business 

table of contents the successful marketing and sales of our products depend upon our third party relationships  which are not supported by written agreements when marketing and selling our semiconductor devices  we believe we enjoy a competitive advantage based on the availability of development tools offered by third parties 
these development tools are used principally for the design of other parts of the embedded system but also work with our products 
we will lose this advantage if these third party tool vendors cease to provide these tools for existing products or do not offer them for our future products 
this event could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we have no written agreements with these third parties  and these parties could choose to stop providing these tools at any time 
our limited ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights could adversely affect our competitive position our future success and competitive position depend upon our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary technology used in our principal products 
currently  we have limited protection of our intellectual property in the form of patents and rely instead on trade secret protection 
our existing or future patents may be invalidated  circumvented  challenged or licensed to others 
the rights granted thereunder may not provide competitive advantages to us 
in addition  our future patent applications may not be issued with the scope of the claims sought by us  if at all 
furthermore  others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology  duplicate our technology or design around the patents owned or licensed by us 
in addition  effective patent  trademark  copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in foreign countries where we may need protection 
we cannot be sure that steps taken by us to protect our technology will prevent misappropriation of the technology 
we may from time to time receive notifications of claims that we may be infringing patents or other intellectual property rights owned by third parties 
while there is currently no intellectual property litigation pending against us  litigation could result in significant expenses to us and adversely affect sales of the challenged product or technology 
this litigation could also divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel  whether or not the litigation is determined in our favor 
in addition  we may not be able to develop or acquire non infringing technology or procure licenses to the infringing technology under reasonable terms 
this could require expenditures by us of substantial time and other resources 
any of these developments would have a material adverse effect on our business 
the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry may lead to significant variances in the demand for our products in the last few years  the semiconductor industry has been characterized by significant downturns and wide fluctuations in supply and demand 
also  during this time  the industry has experienced significant fluctuations in anticipation of changes in general economic conditions 
this cyclicality has led to significant variances in product demand and production capacity 
it has also accelerated erosion of average selling prices per unit 
we may experience periodic fluctuations in our future financial results because of industry wide conditions 
because we sell our products to customers outside of north america and because our products are incorporated with products of others that are sold outside of north america we face foreign business  political and economic risks sales outside of north america accounted for   and  of our revenues in   and  respectively 
we anticipate that sales outside of north america will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues in future periods 
in addition  equipment manufacturers who incorporate our products into their products sell their products outside of north america  thereby exposing us indirectly to foreign risks 
further  most of our semiconductor products are manufactured outside of north america 
accordingly  we are subject to international risks  including difficulties in managing distributors  
table of contents difficulties in staffing and managing foreign subsidiary and branch operations  political and economic instability  foreign currency exchange fluctuations  difficulties in accounts receivable collections  potentially adverse tax consequences  timing and availability of export licenses  changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other barriers  difficulties in obtaining governmental approvals for telecommunications and other products  and the burden of complying with complex foreign laws and treaties 
because sales of our products have been denominated to date exclusively in united states dollars  increases in the value of the united states dollar will increase the price of our products so that they become relatively more expensive to customers in the local currency of a particular country  which could lead to a reduction in sales and profitability in that country 
our potential future acquisitions may not be successful because of our limited experience with acquisitions in the past there have been a significant number of mergers and acquisitions in the semiconductor industry in the past 
as part of our business strategy  we expect to review acquisition prospects that would complement our existing product offerings  improve market coverage or enhance our technological capabilities 
future acquisitions could result in any or all of the following potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  large one time write offs  the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  difficulties in the assimilation of operations  personnel  technologies  products and the information systems of the acquired companies  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  risks of entering geographic and business markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  and potential loss of key employees of acquired organizations 
we have had limited experience with acquisitions in the past and may not be able to successfully integrate any businesses  products  technologies or personnel that may be acquired in the future 
our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business 

table of contents our principal stockholders have significant voting power and may take actions that may not be in the best interests of our other stockholders our executive officers  directors and other principal stockholders  in the aggregate  beneficially own a substantial amount of our outstanding common stock 
although these stockholders do not have majority control  they currently have  and likely will continue to have  significant influence with respect to the election of our directors and approval or disapproval of our significant corporate actions 
this influence over our affairs might be adverse to the interests of other stockholders 
in addition  the voting power of these stockholders could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of plx 
the anti takeover provisions in our certificate of incorporation could adversely affect the rights of the holders of our common stock anti takeover provisions of delaware law and our certificate of incorporation may make a change in control of plx more difficult  even if a change in control would be beneficial to the stockholders 
these provisions may allow the board of directors to prevent changes in the management and control of plx 
as part of our anti takeover devices  our board of directors has the ability to determine the terms of preferred stock and issue preferred stock without the approval of the holders of the common stock 
our certificate of incorporation allows the issuance of up to  shares of preferred stock 
there are no shares of preferred stock outstanding 
however  because the rights and preferences of any series of preferred stock may be set by the board of directors in its sole discretion without approval of the holders of the common stock  the rights and preferences of this preferred stock may be superior to those of the common stock 
accordingly  the rights of the holders of common stock may be adversely affected 
consistent with delaware law  our board of directors may adopt additional anti takeover measures in the future 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have an investment portfolio of fixed income securities  including those classified as cash equivalents  short and long term investments of approximately million at december  these securities are subject to interest rate fluctuations and will decrease in market value if interest rates increase 
the primary objective of the company s investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
the company invests primarily in high quality  short term and long term debt instruments 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in less than million decrease less than in the fair value of the company s available for sale securities
