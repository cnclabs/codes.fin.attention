item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations certain forward looking information this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act and section e of the exchange act 
in addition  we may from time to time make oral forward looking statements 
these statements may generally be identified by the use of such words as expect  anticipate  believe  intend  plan  will  or shall  and include  but are not necessarily limited to  all of the statements marked below with an asterisk 
such forward looking statements are based on current expectations and entail various risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in such forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  including but not limited to the following the office  contact center  mobile  computer  residential  and other specialty product markets not developing as we expect  and a failure to respond adequately to either changes in technology or customer preference s 
for a discussion of such factors  this annual report on form k should be read in conjunction with our annual report to stockholders and the risk factors affecting future operating results  included herein 
the following discussions titled annual results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with those risk factors  the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere herein 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon plantronics consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management bases estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue net of estimated product returns and expected payments to resellers for customer programs including cooperative advertising  marketing development funds  volume rebates  and special pricing programs 
product returns are provided against revenues upon shipment  based on historical return rates  the product stage relative to its expected life cycle  and assumptions regarding the rate of sell through to end users from our various channels based on historical sell through rates 
should product lives vary significantly from our estimates  or should a particular selling channel experience a higher than estimated return rate  or a slower sell through rate causing inventory build up  then our estimated returns  which net against revenue  may need to be revised 
reductions to revenue for expected and actual payments to resellers for volume rebates and pricing protection are based on actual expenses incurred during the period  on estimates for what is due to resellers for estimated credits earned during the period and any adjustments for credits based on actual activity 
if market conditions warrant  plantronics may take action to stimulate demand  which could include increasing promotional programs  decreasing prices  or increasing discounts 
such actions could result in incremental reductions to revenue and margin at the time incentives are offered 
to the extent that we reduce pricing  we may incur reductions to revenue for price protection based on our estimate of inventory in the channel that is subject to such pricing actions 
accounts receivable 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and generally require no collateral from our customers 
plantronics maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed monthly and adjusted if deemed necessary 
if the financial condition of our customers should deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory 
we maintain reserves for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based on projected future shipments using historical selling rates  and taking into account market conditions  inventory on hand  purchase commitments  product development plans and life expectancy  and competitive factors 
if markets for plantronics products and corresponding demand decline  then additional reserves may be necessary 
warranty 
we provide for the estimated cost of warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and our costs to repair or replace the products 
should actual failure rates and costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the warranty obligation may be required 
goodwill and intangibles 
as a result of acquisitions we have made  we have goodwill and intangible assets on our balance sheet 
these assets affect the amount of future amortization expense and possible impairment charges that we may incur 
the determination of the value of goodwill and intangible assets  as well as the useful life of amortizable intangible assets  requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our financial statements 
we perform an annual impairment review of goodwill 
if actual or expected revenue significantly declines  we may be required to record an impairment charge 
deferred taxes 
we record deferred tax assets at the amounts estimated to be realizable 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the value of the corresponding assets  if we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  then an adjustment would be required 
annual results of operations net sales 
net sales in fiscal increased to million compared to million in fiscal  which in turn decreased compared to fiscal net sales of million 
each of these fiscal years contained weeks 
in fiscal  our growth primarily came from revenues on new products developed within the last months including office  mobile and computer products  as well as sales from the acquired ameriphone product line 
compared to the prior year  on a worldwide basis  revenues grew in all major geographies and channels with the exception of original equipment manufacturer oem sales 
the decrease in oem sales was more than offset by sales through walker ameriphone distribution channels  and through our traditional distribution and retail channels 
fiscal was a challenging year for plantronics 
compared to fiscal  on a worldwide basis  fiscal revenues declined in all major geographies and channels 
while revenues from mobile products grew  revenues declined in all other product markets 
the growth in our mobile products reflected modest overall market growth and  in our opinion  an improved market position 
domestic sales increased to million in fiscal  compared to a decrease of to million in fiscal from million in fiscal domestic sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal increased in all major us channels  with the exception of oem  with the most significant increases in sales of our walker ameriphone products for the hearing impaired  as well as sales of our headsets 
ameriphone  inc was acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal domestic sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal decreased in all major us channels  including us distribution  oem and retail 
we believe the decline was due to the recession in the us and the severe cutbacks in it and telecom equipment spending 
international sales accounted for approximately of total net sales in fiscal  up from of total net sales in fiscal and in fiscal international sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal increased to million compared to million in fiscal  which in turn decreased compared to million in fiscal the sales increase in fiscal reflected growth in each of the european  asia pacific latin american and canadian regions and was favorably affected by the strengthening of the euro and the great british pound during the year 
international sales in fiscal decreased as compared to fiscal  in each of the european  asia pacific latin american and canadian regions reflecting lagging economies 
we recognize that although certain economic indicators have improved  the overall economic environment remains uncertain  and we thus remain cautiously optimistic concerning the overall demand for our products in the current economic environment and the upcoming fiscal year 
gross profit 
gross profit in fiscal increased to million of net sales  compared to million of net sales in fiscal gross profit in fiscal decreased compared to gross profit of million of net sales in fiscal in fiscal  the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was favorably affected by foreign exchange rates and the achievement of cost reduction goals during the year 
in addition  we were successful at better inventory management  which led to lower requirements for provisions relating to excess and obsolete material 
we also experienced lower requirements for warranty and improved factory utilization due to higher volumes on relatively fixed manufacturing overhead 
in fiscal  the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales compared to fiscal mainly reflected the decline in revenues of our higher margin office and contact center products and a resulting mix shift to lower margin products  particularly our mobile products 
lower sales volume resulted in fixed overhead costs being spread over a smaller number of units  causing gross margin to decline 
we also increased our warranty provision and our provision for excess and obsolete inventory during fiscal  reflecting our emphasis on more consumer oriented products with higher return rates and more volatile demand 
research  development and engineering 
research  development and engineering expenses in fiscal increased to million of net sales  compared to million of net sales in fiscal research  development and engineering expenses in fiscal increased compared to million of net sales in fiscal the increases in these expenses in fiscal and fiscal reflected a marked increase in the number of products in the pipeline at a particularly active stage of development  our continued investment in new product development including bluetooth and other wireless technologies  and a general broadening of our product line in each of our markets 
as a result of the number of products in the development pipeline and key process improvements in development  we expect a modest decline in our product development expenses in fiscal selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal increased to million of net sales  compared to million of net sales in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal decreased compared to million of net sales in fiscal the overall increase in the level of spending in fiscal was to support increased revenues and also reflected the strengthening of the euro and the great british pound against the dollar during the year  which increased the cost of marketing programs in europe 
in fiscal  the overall decrease in the level of spending compared with fiscal was consistent with the decline in revenues 
the reduction in expenses in fiscal was attributable to plantronics focusing on certain limited sales and marketing programs that we believed gave us a positive return on investment 
general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of net sales in fiscal compared to fiscal  mainly driven by higher legal expenses  a larger provision for doubtful accounts  and the inclusion of a full year of expenses relating to ameriphone 
general and administrative expenses in fiscal increased as a percentage of net sales from fiscal  mainly driven by higher legal expenses  the addition of ameriphone s general and administrative expenses from the date of acquisition during the fourth quarter of fiscal  and the decline in revenues 
operating income 
operating income in fiscal increased to million of net sales  compared to million of net sales in fiscal operating income in fiscal decreased compared to million of net sales in fiscal in fiscal  the increase in operating income over fiscal was primarily driven by improved gross margin on higher net sales 
in fiscal  the decrease in operating income over fiscal was primarily driven by lower net sales and the corresponding decrease in gross profit 
interest and other income  net 
interest and other income in fiscal increased million to million compared to million in fiscal  which in turn increased million compared to million in fiscal the increase in interest and other income in fiscal was primarily attributable to foreign exchange gains due to more favorable european exchange rates 
the increase in interest and other income in fiscal was also due to foreign exchange gains as the euro and great british pound values strengthened against the dollar 
foreign currency transaction losses  net of the effect of hedging activity  for fiscal and were million  and million  respectively 
foreign currency transaction gains  net of the effect of hedging activity for fiscal were million 
income tax expense 
in fiscal   and  income tax expense was million  million  and million  respectively 
our effective tax rates for these years were   and  and included tax benefits of million and million  in and  respectively  arising from expiration of statutes of limitations and a favorable tax assessment 
in fiscal  we expect the effective tax rate to be approximately 
financial condition operating activities 
during the fiscal year ended march   we generated million of cash from operating activities  due primarily to million in net income  depreciation and amortization of million  an income tax benefit of million associated with the exercise of stock options  a decrease of million in inventory and an increase of million in accrued liabilities  respectively  offset by an increase of million in accounts receivable and a decrease of million in income taxes payable 
in comparison  we generated million in cash from operating activities for the fiscal year ended march   due mainly to million in net income  depreciation and amortization of million  decreases of and million in inventory and accounts receivable  respectively  an increase of million in accounts payable  and an income tax benefit of million associated with the exercise of stock options 
p investing activities 
during fiscal  we purchased marketable securities of million and received proceeds from maturities of marketable securities of million 
expenditures for capital assets of million were incurred principally in tooling for new products  furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements for facilities expansion 
during fiscal  we purchased marketable securities of million and received proceeds from maturities of marketable securities of million 
expenditures for capital assets of million were incurred principally in tooling for new products  furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements for facilities expansion 
in january  we purchased ameriphone  a leading supplier of amplified telephones and other solutions to address the needs of individuals with hearing impairment and other special needs 
the net cash expended for this acquisition was million 
financing activities 
during the fiscal year ended march   we repurchased million shares of our common stock for million at an average price of per share  and reissued through employee benefit plans  shares of our treasury stock for million 
as of march   we remained authorized to repurchase  shares under all repurchase plans 
we also received million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options during the fiscal year ended march  in the fiscal year ended march   we repurchased million shares of our common stock at an average price of for million and reissued through employee benefit plans  shares of our treasury stock for million 
we also received million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options during the fiscal year ended march  liquidity and capital resources 
we generated positive cash flows from operations for fiscal and fiscal totaling million and million  respectively 
our primary cash requirements have been  and are expected to be  for capital expenditures  mainly for tooling for new products and leasehold improvements for facilities improvements and expansion  and for the repurchase of our common stock 
we estimate that fiscal capital expenditures will be approximately million 
as of march   we had working capital of million  including million of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  compared with working capital of million  including million of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  as of march  in july  we renewed our revolving credit facility with a major bank at million  including a million letter of credit subfacility 
the renewed facility and subfacility both expire on july   and we intend to renew these facilities in the ordinary course of business 
as of april   we had no cash borrowings under the revolving credit facility and million outstanding under the letter of credit subfacility 
the terms of the credit facility contain covenants including net funded debt to earnings before income taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda ratio  an interest coverage ratio  and a quick ratio  that materially limit our ability to incur debt and pay dividends  among other matters 
these covenants may adversely affect our financial position to the extent we cannot comply with them 
we are currently in compliance with the covenants under this agreement 
beginning in the first quarter of fiscal  and throughout fiscal  we entered into foreign currency forward exchange contracts  which typically mature in one month  to hedge the exposure to foreign currency fluctuations of expected foreign currency denominated receivables  payables and cash balances 
we record on the balance sheet at each reporting period the fair value of our forward exchange contracts and record any fair value adjustments in results of operations 
gains and losses associated with currency rate changes on the contracts are recorded as other income expense  offsetting transaction gains and losses on the related assets and liabilities 
in april of  plantronics began an additional hedging program to hedge a portion of euro and great british pound revenues with put and call option contracts 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations that were reasonably likely to occur as of march   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
contractual obligations payments due by period less than after march  total year years years years in thousands operating leases      unconditional purchase obligations 
  forward exchange contracts   total contractual cash obligations 
     we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities balances together with anticipated cash flows from operations  will be sufficient to fund operations for at least the next months 
however  any projections of future financial needs and sources of working capital are subject to uncertainty 
see quot  certain forward looking information quot  and quot  risk factors affecting future operating results quot  included herein  for factors that could affect our estimates of future financial needs and sources of working capital 
risk factors affecting future operating results investors or potential investors in our stock should carefully consider the risks described below 
our stock price will reflect the performance of our business relative to  among other things  our competition  general economic and market conditions  industry conditions  and the continuing lack of investor confidence in the current accounting and reporting practices of corporations in the united states 
you should carefully consider the following factors in connection with any investment in our stock 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if any of the risks occur 
should any or all of the following risks materialize  the trading price of our stock could decline and investors could lose all or part of their investment 
we may face further reduction in overall demand for our products if the national or international economic growth declines or experiences a double dip recession 
our markets have exhibited cyclical behavior especially notable since the fourth quarter of fiscal our business is affected by general economic conditions in the us and globally  which have led to reduced demand for a variety of goods and services  including many technology products 
if these trends are worse or last longer than presently anticipated  we may not achieve the level of sales required to achieve our projected financial results  which could in turn materially adversely affect the market price of our stock 
a substantial portion of our sales come from the contact center market and a further decline in demand in that market could materially adversely affect our results 
we have historically derived  and continue to derive  a substantial portion of our net sales from the contact center market 
although we saw a slight increase in sales in this market in the second half of fiscal year  this market has shown signs of saturation in the past year 
there was a general reduction in the level of overall market demand for contact center products  and there may also be a surplus of existing inventory in use at contact centers that will slow future demand for our products 
while we believe that this market may grow in future periods  this growth could be slow or revenues from this market could continue to decline in response to various factors 
for example  consumer resistance to telemarketing  including the enactment of legislation enabling consumers to block telemarketing calls could materially adversely affect growth in the contact center market 
a continued deterioration in general economic conditions could result in a reduction in the establishmen t of new contact centers and in capital investments to expand or upgrade existing centers  and we believe this is in fact currently negatively affecting our business 
because of our reliance on the contact center market  we will be affected more by changes in the rate of contact center establishment and expansion and the communications products that contact center agents use  than would a company serving a broader market 
any decrease in the demand for contact centers and related headset products could cause a decrease in the demand for our products  which would materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
new product development is risky and we will be materially adversely affected if we do not respond to changing customer requirements and new technologies 
our product development efforts historically have been directed toward enhancement of existing products and development of new products that capitalize on our core capabilities 
the success of new product introductions is dependent on a number of factors  including the proper selection of new technologies  product features  timely completion and introduction of new product designs  cost effective manufacture of such products  quality of new products and market acceptance 
although we attempt to determine the specific needs of headset users in our target markets  because almost all of our sales are indirect  we may not always be able to timely and accurately predict end user requirements 
as a result  our products  specifically  our range of bluetooth products  may not be timely developed  designed to address current or future end user requirements  offered at competitive prices or achieve broad customer acceptance among end users  which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
demand for new wireless headsets may not develop as we anticipate 
moreover  we generally incur substantial research and development costs before the technical feasibility and commercial viability of a new product can be ascertained 
accordingly  revenue growth rates and operating margins from new products may not be sufficient to recover the associated development costs 
historically  the technology used in lightweight communications headsets has evolved slowly 
new products have primarily offered stylistic changes and quality improvements  rather than significant new technologies 
the technology used in hands free communications devices  including our products  is evolving more rapidly now than it has historically and we anticipate that this trend may accelerate 
we believe this is particularly true for our newer emerging technology products especially in the mobile  computer markets  residential and certain parts of the office market 
we believe products designed to serve these markets generally exhibit shorter lifecycles and are increasingly based on open standards and protocols 
the end markets served are much larger than the traditional contact center market 
this combination of factors may lead to increased commoditization  as a greater number of competitors attempt to introduce products  or reverse engineer our products and offer similar but lower q uality products at lower price points 
our success depends upon our ability to enhance existing products  to respond to changing market requirements  and to develop and introduce in a timely manner new products that keep pace with technological developments 
although we strive to be a leader in developing new technologies  products and solutions  the technologies  products and solutions that we choose to pursue may not become as commercially successful as we planned 
moreover  the recent health risks in asia surrounding the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars may affect our ability to timely develop and deliver new products because of our reliance on the asian markets for some of our components and products 
we may experience difficulties in realizing the expected benefits from our investments in new technologies 
if we are unable to develop and introduce enhanced or new products in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements  it will materially adversely affect our business  fina ncial condition and results of operations 
with the historically slow evolution of our products  we have generally been able to phase out obsolete products without significant impact to our operating margins 
as we develop new generations of products more quickly  we expect that the pace of product obsolescence will increase concurrently 
the disposition of inventories of obsolete products may result in reductions to our operating margins and materially adversely affect our earnings and results of operations 
increased adoption of speech activated and voice interactive software products by businesses could limit our ability to grow in the contact center market 
we are seeing a proliferation of speech activated and voice interactive software in the market place 
we have been re assessing long term growth prospects for the contact center market given the growth rate and the advancement of these new voice recognition based technologies 
businesses that first embraced them to resolve labor shortages at the peak of the last economic up cycle are now increasing spending on these technologies in hopes of reducing total costs 
we may experience a decline in our sales to the contact center market if businesses increase their adoption of speech activated and voice interactive software as an alternative to customer service agents 
should this trend continue  it could cause a net reduction in contact center agents and our revenues to this market segment could decline rather than grow in future years 
we are counting on the office  mobile  computer and residential markets to develop  and we could be materially adversely affected if they do not develop as we expect 
while the contact center market is still a substantial portion of our business  we believe that our future prospects will depend in large part on the growth in demand for headsets in the office  mobile  computer and residential markets 
these communications headset markets are relatively new and undeveloped 
moreover  we do not have extensive experience in selling headset products to customers in these markets 
if the demand for headsets in these markets fails to develop  or develops more slowly than we currently anticipate  or if we are unable to effectively market our products to customers in these markets  it would have a material adverse effect on the potential demand for our products and on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
these headset markets are also subject to general economic conditions and if there is a continued slowing of national or international economic growth or a double dip recession  these markets may not materialize to the levels w e require to achieve our anticipated financial results  which could in turn materially adversely affect the market price of our stock 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly from a number of causes outside our control 
our quarterly results of operations may vary significantly in the future for a variety of reasons  including the following general economic conditions  compounded by the events on and following september   changes in demand for our products  including order cancellation by customers  impact of acquired businesses and technologies  insolvency of purchasers of our products or failure of purchasers of our products to pay amounts due to us  timing and size of orders from customers  price erosion  inability to ramp production or delays in deliveries of components and subassemblies by our suppliers  penalties for cancellation or inability to cancel custom components  changes in the mix of products sold by us  variances in the timing and amount of engineering and operating expenses  distribution channel mix variations  changes in the levels of cooperative advertising or market development funding required by retail resellers of our products  delays in shipments of our products  material product returns and customer credits  new product introductions by us or our competitors  entrance of new competitors  changes in actual or target inventory levels of our channel partners  changes in the costs of our raw materials  components and subassemblies  seasonal fluctuations in demand and linearity of sales within the quarter  our ability to conduct business effectively in asia and other parts of the world as a result of the impact of sars  and the impact on the us economy due to the conflict in iraq and geopolitical risk factors in the middle east and north korea 
each of the above factors is difficult to forecast and thus could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we generally ship most orders during the quarter in which they are received 
as a result  quarterly net sales and operating results depend primarily on the volume and timing of orders received during the quarter 
it is difficult to forecast orders for a given quarter 
since a large portion of our operating expenses  including rent  salaries and certain manufacturing expenses  are fixed and difficult to reduce or modify  if net sales do not meet our expectations  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicative of future operating results 
in addition  our operating results in a future quarter or quarters may fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors  and  as a result  the price of our common stock might fall 
if we are not able to collect on our accounts receivable due to the general economic decline  we may be materially adversely affected 
if the overall economy continues to slow further  or experiences a quot  double dip quot  recession  it could affect the financial health of certain purchasers of our products  potentially resulting in the failure of such purchasers to pay amounts that they owe to us 
due to the decline in the economy  the credit risks relating to these resellers customers have increased 
we generally offer our customers certain credit terms  allowing them to pay for products purchased from us between and days or more after we ship the products 
receipt of payment for our products depends on the financial liquidity of those customers 
if significant customers  or a significant number of customers  experience liquidity problems  this could affect our ability to collect our accounts receivable  which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
while we have implemented certain programs to assist us in monitoring and mitigating these risks  ther e can be no assurance that such programs will be effective in reducing our credit risks 
we also continue to monitor credit exposures from weakened financial conditions in certain geographic regions and the impact that such conditions may have on the worldwide economy 
we have experienced losses due to defaults by our customers on their accounts payable 
although these losses have not been significant  future payment defaults by customers could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
we have strong competitors and will likely face additional competition in the future 
the markets for our products are highly competitive 
we compete with a variety of companies in the various markets for communications headsets 
our single largest competitor is gn netcom  a subsidiary of gn great nordic ltd  a danish telecommunications conglomerate 
gn netcom has made a number of acquisitions over the years  most recently  claria headsets  an australian based manufacturer of office  contact center and mobile headsets 
we believe the acquisitions of unex  acs wireless  nortel liberation  ab transistor  jabra  hello direct  sensortech  qubit and claria have provided gn netcom with a broader product line and greater marketing presence than it had prior to these acquisitions 
we believe it is reasonable to anticipate that gn netcom may continue to make additional acquisitions 
we currently operate principally in a multilevel distribution model we sell most of our products to distributors who  in turn  resell to dealers or end customers 
gn netcom s acquisitions indicate it may be moving towards a direct sales model  since six of the nine acquisitions were of companies employing direct sales and marketing models 
while we believe that our business and our customers benefit from our current distribution structure  if gn netcom or other competitors sell directly  they may offer lower prices which could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 
labtec  inc was acquired by logitech international sa in march and is a significant competitor in the computer headset market 
logitech is a manufacturer and seller of computer accessory products 
following this acquisition  labtec gained greater resources with which to compete with us than it had prior to the acquisition 
in addition  it has expanded its product offerings to include mobil e headsets to address the changing regulatory environment regarding driver safety and mobile phone usage 
we anticipate that we will face additional competition from companies that currently do not offer communications headsets 
this is particularly true in the office  mobile  computer and residential markets 
since the merger of the mobile businesses of sony corporation and telefonaktiebolaget lm ericsson in  they have announced the launch of two commercially available bluetooth wireless headsets 
on october   danish manufacturer of audiology products  william demant holdings a s  and germany s maker of professional electroacoustic products  sennheiser electronics gmbh amp  co 
kg  announced the establishment of a joint venture in the telecommunication headset industry  sennheiser communications a s 
if this joint venture is successful  we expect the combination of william demant holdings technology expertise with sennheiser s established distribution channels will create additional competition 
we anticipate other competition from consumer electronics companies that currently manufacture and sell mobile phones or computer peripheral equipment 
these new competitors are likely to be larger  offer broader product lines  bundle or integrate with other products communications headset tops and bases manufactured by them or others  offer products containing bases that are incompatible with our headset tops and have substantially greater financial  marketing and other resources than we do 
we anticipate that we will also face additional competition from companies  principally located in the far east  which offer very low cost headset products  including products which are modeled on  or are direct copies of our products 
these new competitors are likely to offer very low cost products which may result in price pressure in the market 
if market prices are substantially reduced by such new entrants into the headset market  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
we believe that the market for lightweight communications headsets is showing some signs of commoditization 
in particular  we believe that our competitors  especially gn netcom  have chosen to compete more on price than they have historically 
while this has long been true of competitors from the far east  and has been true of gn for the last two years or so  we think the trend remains and that customers are also more receptive to lower cost products  even when the quality  service or total value of the offer may be notably lower as well 
historically  our expertise in acoustics and design has allowed us to design  develop and manufacture products with the levels of sound quality enabling us to meet the needs of our customers 
due to technological advances such as better digital signal processing  our current and future competitors may be able to develop products with the same or better audio quality at lower costs 
these competitors will be able to compete more effectively in terms of product quality or price that could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 
we believe that important competitive factors for us are price  product reliability  product features  product mix  customer service and support  marketing  reputation  distribution  ability to meet delivery schedules  and warranty terms and product life 
if we do not compete successfully with respect to any of these or other factors it could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
further  if we do not successfully develop and market products that compete successfully with those of our competitors  it would materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we do not match production to demand  we will be at risk of losing business or our gross margins could be materially adversely affected 
historically  we have generally been able to increase production to meet increasing demand 
however  the demand for our products is dependent on many factors and such demand is inherently difficult to forecast 
we have experienced sharp fluctuations in demand  especially for headsets for wireless and cellular phones 
significant unanticipated fluctuations in demand and the global trend towards consignment of products could cause the following operating problems  among others if forecasted demand does not develop  we could have excess production or excess capacity 
excess production could result in higher inventories of finished products  components and subassemblies 
if we were unable to sell these inventories  we would have to write off some or all of our inventories of excess products and unusable components and subassemblies 
excess manufacturing capacity could lead to higher production costs and lower margins 
significant reduction in production levels to address decreases in demand may leave us unprepared to meet a rapid increase in demand for our products 
if demand increases beyond that forecasted  we would have to rapidly increase production 
we depend on suppliers to provide additional volumes of components and subassemblies  and are experiencing greater dependencies on single source suppliers 
therefore  we might not be able to increase production rapidly enough to meet unexpected demand 
this could cause us to fail to meet customer expectations 
there could be short term losses of sales while we are trying to increase production 
if customers turn to competitive sources of supply to meet their needs  there could be a long term impact on our revenues 
rapid increases in production levels to meet unanticipated demand could result in higher costs for components and subassemblies  increased expenditures for freight to expedite delivery of required materials  and higher overtime costs and other expenses 
these higher expenditures could lower our profit margins 
further  if production is increased rapidly  there may be decreased manufacturing yields  which may also lower our margins 
the introduction of the new bluetooth headsets presents many significant manufacturing  marketing and other operational risks and uncertainties  including developing and marketing these wireless headset products  unforeseen delays or difficulties in introducing and achieving volume production of such products  our dependence on third parties to supply key components  many of which have long lead times  and our ability to forecast demand and customer return rates accurately for this new product category for which relevant data is incomplete or not available 
any of the foregoing problems could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we expect to make future acquisitions and acquisitions involve material risks 
on january   we acquired a manufacturer of specialty products for the hearing impaired community 
we may in the future  acquire other companies 
there are inherent risks in the acquisition of another company that could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the types of risks faced in connection with acquisitions include cultural differences in the conduct of business  difficulties in integration of the operations  technologies  and products of the acquired company  the risk of diverting management s attention from normal daily operations of the business  potential difficulties in completing projects associated with purchased in process research and development  risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions  the abilities of representatives  distributors  oem customers and other resellers which are retained by the acquired company or customers of the acquired company  differences in the business information systems of the companies  difficulties in integrating the transactions and business information systems of the acquired company  and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company 
mergers and acquisitions  particularly those of high technology companies  are inherently risky  and no assurance can be given that the ameriphone or future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business  operating results or financial condition 
we must also manage any such growth effectively 
failure to manage growth effectively and successfully integrate acquisitions made by us could materially harm our business and operating results 
we depend on our suppliers and failure of our suppliers to provide quality components or services in a timely manner could adversely affect our results 
our growth and ability to meet customer demands depend in part on our capability to obtain timely deliveries of raw materials  components  subassemblies and products from our suppliers 
we buy raw materials  components and subassemblies from a variety of suppliers and assemble them into finished products 
we also have certain of our products manufactured for us by third party suppliers 
the cost  quality  and availability of such goods are essential to the successful production and sale of our products 
obtaining raw materials  components  subassemblies and finished products entails various risks  including the following we obtain certain raw materials  subassemblies  components and products from single suppliers  and alternate sources for these items are not readily available 
to date  we have experienced only minor interruptions in the supply of these raw materials  subassemblies  components and products  none of which has significantly affected our results of operations 
current adverse economic conditions could lead to a higher risk of failure of our suppliers to remain in business or to be able to purchase the raw materials  subcomponents and parts required by them to produce and provide to us the parts we need 
an interruption in supply from any of our single source suppliers in the future would materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
prices of raw materials  components and subassemblies may rise 
if this occurs and we are not able to pass these increases on to our customers or to achieve operating efficiencies that would offset the increases  it would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
due to the lead times required to obtain certain raw materials  subassemblies  components and products from certain foreign suppliers  we may not be able to react quickly to changes in demand  potentially resulting in either excess inventories of such goods or shortages of the raw materials  subassemblies  components and products 
lead times are particularly long on silicon based components incorporating rf and dsp technologies and such components are an increasingly important part of our product costs 
since the second quarter of fiscal  we have been able to keep inventories at an acceptable level  relative to sales 
failure in the future to match the timing of purchases of raw materials  subassemblies  components and products to demand could increase our inventories and or decrease our revenues  consequently materially adversely affecting our business  financial condition and results of operations 
most of our suppliers are not obligated to continue to provide us with raw materials  components and subassemblies 
rather  we buy most raw materials  components and subassemblies on a purchase order basis 
if our suppliers experience increased demand or shortages  it could affect deliveries to us 
in turn  this would affect our ability to manufacture and sell products that are dependent on those raw materials  components and subassemblies 
this would materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
although we generally use standard raw materials  parts and components for our products  the high development costs associated with emerging wireless technologies permits us to work with only a single source of silicon chip sets on any particular new product 
we  or our chosen supplier of chip sets  may experience challenges in designing  developing and manufacturing components in these new technologies which could affect our ability to meet time to market schedules 
due to our dependence on single suppliers for certain chip sets  we could experience higher prices  a delay in development of the chip set  and or the inability to meet our customer demand for these new products 
our business  operating results and financial condition could therefore be materially adversely affected as a result of these factors 
we sell our products through various channels of distribution and a failure of those channels to operate as we expect could decrease our revenues 
we sell substantially all of our products through distributors  retailers  oems and telephony service providers 
our existing relationships with these parties are not exclusive and can be terminated by either party without cause 
our channel partners also sell or can potentially sell products offered by our competitors 
to the extent that our competitors offer our channel partners more favorable terms  such partners may decline to carry  de emphasize or discontinue carrying our products 
in the future  we may not be able to retain or attract a sufficient number of qualified channel partners 
further  such partners may not recommend  or continue to recommend  our products 
in the future  our oem customers or potential oem customers may elect to manufacture their own products  similar to those we currently sell to them 
the inability to establish or maintain successful relationships with distributors  oems  retailers and telephony service providers or to expand our distribution chann els could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our distribution channels generally hold inventories of our products  determined in their own business judgment to be sufficient to meet their customer s delivery requirements 
such inventory levels are subject to market conditions  business judgment by the reseller and our ability to meet their time to ship needs 
rapid reductions by our distributors  oems  retailers and other customers in the levels of inventories held in our products could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our stock price may be volatile and your investment in plantronics stock could be lost 
the market price for our common stock may continue to be affected by a number of factors  including uncertain economic conditions and the decline in investor confidence in the market place  the announcement of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors  the loss of services of one or more of our executive officers or other key employees  quarterly variations in our or our competitors results of operations  changes in our published forecasts of future results of operations  changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts  developments in our industry  sales of substantial numbers of shares of our common stock in the public market  general market conditions  and other factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors 
in addition  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies  in particular  and that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
such factors and fluctuations  as well as general economic  political and market conditions  such as recessions  could materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
if there are problems that affect our principal manufacturing facility in mexico  we could face losses in revenues or material increases in costs of our operations 
the majority of our manufacturing operations are currently performed in a single facility in tijuana  mexico 
a fire  flood or earthquake  political unrest or other disaster or condition affecting our facility could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
while we have developed a disaster recovery plan and believe we are adequately insured with respect to this facility  we may not be able to implement the plan effectively or on a timely basis or recover under applicable insurance policies 
we have significant foreign operations and there are inherent risks in operating abroad 
during fiscal  approximately of our net sales were derived from customers outside the united states 
in addition  we conduct the majority of our headset assembly operations in our manufacturing facility located in mexico  and we obtain most of the components and subassemblies used in our products from various foreign suppliers 
we also purchase a growing number of turn key products directly from asia 
the inherent risks of international operations  either in mexico or in asia  could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the types of risks faced in connection with international operations and sales include cultural differences in the conduct of business  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  economic and political conditions in each country  management and operation of an enterprise spread over various countries  and the burden of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 
our foreign operations put us at risk of loss if there are material changes in currency values as compared to the us dollar 
a significant portion of our business is conducted in currencies other than the us dollar 
substantially all of our sales outside of north america are transacted in the euro or local currencies 
we are therefore exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in exchange rates that can affect our revenue and gross margins and can also generate currency transaction gains and losses 
in fiscal year  and throughout fiscal  we carried out programs designed to reduce our foreign currency net asset exposure and were successful in reducing transaction gains and losses that are accounted for in other income expense 
however  there can be no assurance that our hedging policy will be effective in continuing to reduce transaction gains and losses 
moreover  our economic exposure to foreign currency fluctuations has not changed and revenues and margins can be adversely impacted by such fluctuations 
there can be no assurance that we will not continue to experience currency losses in the future  nor can we predict the effects of future exchange rate fluctuations on future operating results 
to the extent that sales to our foreign customers increase or transactions in foreign currencies increase  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by exchange rate fluctuations 
changes in regulatory requirements may adversely impact our gross margins as we comply with such changes or reduce our ability to generate revenues if we are unable to comply 
our products must meet the requirements set by regulatory authorities in the numerous jurisdictions in which we sell them 
as regulations and local laws change  we must modify our products to address those changes 
regulatory restrictions may increase the costs to design and manufacture our products  resulting in a decrease in demand for our products if the costs are passed along or a decrease in our margins 
compliance with regulatory restrictions may impact the technical quality and capabilities of our products  reducing their marketability 
the terrorist attacks on new york city on september   marked a turning point in current us political  military and security strategies which we believe have  and may continue to  adversely impact our business  both directly and indirectly 
the events of september th  and its aftermath have contributed to a further slowing in the economy with additional layoffs in other industries resulting in a negative effect on our business 
we believe that one direct impact of the attacks is the reduction of contact center agents in the travel and leisure industries 
we are indirectly affected by the continuing concern on future terrorist attacks on us soil 
we are unable to estimate the impact these threats and their consequences have on our business  however  we expect that as these events adversely affect the global economy in general  our financial condition  our operations and our prospects will be similarly adversely affected 
we have intellectual property rights that could be infringed by others and we are potentially at risk of infringement of the intellectual property rights of others 
our success will depend in part on our ability to protect our copyrights  patents  trademarks  trade dress  trade secrets  and similar intellectual property  including our rights to certain domain names 
we rely primarily on a combination of nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions as well as patent  trademark  trade secret  and copyright laws to protect our proprietary rights 
effective trademark  patent  copyright  and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our products and media properties are distributed to customers worldwide 
we currently hold united states patents and additional foreign patents and will continue to seek patents on our inventions when we believe it to be appropriate 
the process of seeking patent protection can be lengthy and expensive 
patents may not be issued in response to our applications  and patents that are issued may be invalidated  circumvented or challenged by others 
if we are required to enforce our patents or other proprietary rights through litigation  the costs and diversion of management s attention could be substantial 
in addition  the rights granted under any patents may not provide us competitive advantages or be adequate to safeguard and maintain our proprietary rights 
moreover  the laws of certain countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
if we do not enforce and protect our intellectual property rights  it could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are exposed to potential lawsuits alleging defects in our products and or hearing loss caused by our products 
the use of our products exposes us to the risk of product liability and hearing loss claims 
these claims have in the past been  and are currently being  asserted against us 
none of the previously resolved claims have materially affected our business  financial condition or results of operations  nor do we believe that any of the pending claims will have such an effect 
although we maintain product liability insurance  the coverage provided under our policies could be unavailable or insufficient to cover the full amount of any such claim 
therefore  successful product liability or hearing loss claims brought against us could have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our mobile headsets are used with mobile telephones 
there has been continuing public controversy over whether the radio frequency emissions from mobile telephones are harmful to users of mobile phones 
we believe that there is no conclusive proof of any health hazard from the use of mobile telephones but that research in this area is incomplete 
we have tested our headsets through independent laboratories and have found that use of our headsets reduces radio frequency emissions at the user s head to virtually zero 
however  if research was to establish a health hazard from the use of mobile telephones or public controversy grows even in the absence of conclusive research findings  there could be an adverse impact on the demand for our mobile headsets 
there is also continuing and increasing public controversy over the use of mobile telephones by operators of motor vehicles 
while we believe that our products enhance driver safety by permitting a motor vehicle operator to generally be able to keep both hands free to operate the vehicle  there is no certainty that this is the case and we may be subject to claims arising from allegations that use of a mobile telephone and headset contributed to a motor vehicle accident 
we maintain product liability insurance and general liability insurance that we believe would cover any such claims 
however  the coverage provided under our policies could be unavailable or insufficient to cover the full amount of any such claim 
therefore  successful product liability claims brought against us could have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are exposed to potential litigation from third parties which is costly to defend and consumes management s time and could possibly divert focus away from our business 
from time to time  third parties  including our competitors  may assert intellectual property rights or other commercial claims against us 
these claims  if they are asserted  could result in costly litigation and diversion of management s attention regardless of the merit of a claim 
in addition  we may not ultimately prevail in any such litigation or be able to license any valid and infringed patents from such third parties on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
any infringement claim or other litigation against us could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
while we believe we comply with environmental laws and regulations  we are still exposed to potential risks from environmental matters 
we are subject to various federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws and regulations  including those governing the use  discharge and disposal of hazardous substances in the ordinary course of our manufacturing process 
although we believe that our current manufacturing operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations  environmental legislation has been enacted and may in the future be enacted or interpreted to create environmental liability with respect to our facilities or operations 
we have included in our financial statements a reserve of million for possible environmental remediation of the site of one of our previous businesses 
while no claims have been asserted against us in connection with this matter  such claims could be asserted in the future and any liability that might result could exceed the amount of the reserve 
we have several significant stockholders  and given the low trading volume of our stock  if they sell their shares in a short period of time we could see an adverse effect on the market price of our stock 
as of april   we had  shares of common stock outstanding 
these shares are freely tradable except for approximately  shares held by affiliates of plantronics 
these approximately  shares may be sold in reliance on rule under the securities act  or pursuant to an effective registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission 
approximately  additional shares are subject to outstanding stock options as of april  the issuance of these shares upon exercise of stock options has been registered 
accordingly  to the extent that these shares vest and are issued in the future  they may be freely resold by stockholders who are not our affiliates 
our affiliates may resell these shares to the extent permitted by rule under the securities act 
our stock is not heavily traded 
the average daily trading volume of our stock in the fourth quarter of fiscal was  shares per day with a median volume in that period of  shares per day 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market by any of our officers  directors or other stockholders could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of equity securities 
our business could be materially adversely affected if we lose the benefit of the services of ken kannappan or other key personnel 
our success depends to a significant extent upon the services of a limited number of executive officers and other key employees 
the unanticipated loss of the services of our president and chief executive officer  mr 
kannappan  or one or more of our other executive officers or key employees could have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we also believe that our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain additional highly skilled technical  management  sales and marketing personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense 
we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel  and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
provisions in our charter documents and delaware law and our adoption of a stockholder rights plan may delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us  which could decrease the value of our stock 
our board of directors has the authority to issue preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions  including voting and conversion rights  of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders 
the issuance of our preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 
in addition  we are subject to the anti takeover provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  which could also have the effect of delaying or preventing our acquisition by a third party 
further  certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could delay or make more difficult a merger  tender offer or proxy contest  which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in the first quarter of calendar year  our board of directors adopted a stockholders right plan  pursuant to which we distributed one right for each outstanding share of common stock held by stockholders of record as of april  because the rights may substantially dilute the stock ownership of a person or group attempting to take us over without the approval of our board of directors  the plan could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  or a significant percentage of our outstanding capital stock  without first negotiating with our board of directors regarding such acquisition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discusses our exposure to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results could vary materially as a result of a number of factors including those set forth in risk factors affecting future operating results 
interest rate risk at march   we had cash and cash equivalents totaling million  compared to million at march  at march   we had marketable securities totaling million compared to million at march  cash equivalents have an original maturity of days or less  marketable securities have an original maturity of greater than days  but less than one year 
we believe we are not currently exposed to significant interest rate risk as the majority of our cash and marketable securities were invested in securities or interest bearing accounts with maturities of less than days 
the average maturity period for our investments at march  was less than three months 
the taxable equivalent interest rates locked in on those investments ranged from to 
our investment policy requires that we only invest in deposit accounts  certificates of deposit or commercial paper with minimum ratings of a p and money market mutual funds with m inimum ratings of aaa 
in july  we renewed our revolving credit facility  including a letter of credit subfacility  with a major bank at million 
the facility and subfacility both expire on july  as of april   we had no cash borrowings under the revolving credit facility and million outstanding under the letter of credit subfacility 
if we choose to borrow under this facility in the future  and market interest rates rise  then our interest payments would increase accordingly 
foreign currency exchange rate risk approximately of our fiscal revenue was derived from sales outside of the united states  with approximately denominated in foreign currencies  predominately the great british pound and the euro 
approximately of our fiscal revenue was derived from sales outside of the united states  with approximately denominated predominately in the great british pound and the euro 
approximately of fiscal revenue was derived from sales outside the unties states  with approximately denominated in the great british pound and the euro 
during fiscal we did not engage in any hedging activities 
in fiscal  and during fiscal we engaged in a hedging strategy to minimize the effect of these currency fluctuations 
specifically  we hedged our european transaction exposure  hedging both our great british pound and euro positions 
however  we have no assurance that exchange rate fluctuations will not materially adversely affect our business in the future 
the following table provides information about our financial instruments and underlying transactions that are sensitive to foreign exchange rates  including foreign currency forward exchange contracts and nonfunctional currency denominated receivables and payables 
the net amount that is exposed to changes in foreign currency rates is then subjected to a change in the value of the foreign currency versus the us dollar 
we believe we have no material sensitivity to changes in foreign currency rates on our net exposed financial instrument position
