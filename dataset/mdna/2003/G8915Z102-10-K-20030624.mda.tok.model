under sfas  the company no longer amortizes goodwill or intangibles having indefinite lives  which reduced sg a expenses from their fiscal year level by approximately  instead  sfas requires an initial test at adoption  and subsequent tests at least annually thereafter  of recorded goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles assets to determine if the carrying values of such assets exceed their implied fair values as calculated under sfas the adoption of sfas resulted in a non cash charge in the first quarter of fiscal year of  this charge was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the consolidated statements of operations 
the company performed its first annual impairment review of goodwill and intangible assets under sfas during the fourth quarter of fiscal year as a result of this review  the company recorded a non cash charge of  in operating expenses for the impairment of goodwill  principally in its us wholesale component 
these charges had no effect on the company s credit facilities  financial covenants or cash flows 
prior to april   the company recorded deferred tax liabilities relating to the difference in the book and tax basis of intangible assets  principally trademark rights 
as a result of adopting sfas  those deferred tax liabilities will no longer be used to support the realization of certain deferred tax assets

the business of th europe includes both wholesale distribution as well as the operation of retail stores 
in addition  the th europe acquisition results in a reduction in the company s licensing segment revenue as the company s royalties from th europe are eliminated in consolidation subsequent to the acquisition

licensing segment net revenue increased during fiscal year from fiscal year due to higher royalty income on various licensed products 
within the wholesale segment  a decline in net revenue in the menswear component was partially offset by increases in net revenue in the women s and childrenswear components 
the company s net revenue during fiscal year  in both the wholesale and retail segments  also benefited from the contribution of th europe  which  as noted above  the company acquired on july  net revenue at th europe has grown from fiscal to fiscal  including the effect of translating th europe s net revenue at a higher average euro exchange rate in fiscal year compared to fiscal year the fluctuations in net revenue in each of these segments were primarily volume related and are further described below in the segment operations section 
net revenue by segment after elimination of intersegment revenue was as follows fiscal year ended march  wholesale retail licensing total gross profit as a percentage of net revenue increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the improvement was due to an improvement in the gross margin of the company s wholesale segment  as well as a higher contribution of the retail segment  which generates a higher gross margin than the company s consolidated gross margin  to total net revenue 
gross margin in the wholesale segment improved due to a higher contribution of th europe in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year  as th europe generates a higher gross margin than the company s us components 
the current year s gross profit was negatively impacted by  of special charges related to inventory of the us specialty division that were included in cost of goods sold

the increase in the retail segment operating expenses was due to operating new stores since march  before closing us specialty stores in march  operating expenses increased to  or of net revenue  in fiscal from  or of net revenue  in fiscal this increase was mainly due to the acquisition of th europe and the growth in the retail segment  partially offset by reductions in the company s wholesale segment and corporate expenses 
interest and other expense increased from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year  after decreasing slightly from  in fiscal year the increase in fiscal year was due to interest expense associated with the issuance of  principal amount of senior bonds due december  the bonds 
the bonds were issued on december  and were outstanding for the entire fiscal year as opposed to four months in fiscal year partially offset by the lower interest expense due to the repurchase  prior to maturity  of  principal amount of the notes which matured on june  the notes

index to financial statements application of critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the period 
significant accounting policies employed by the company  including the use of estimates  are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements in item critical accounting estimates are those that require management to make assumptions that are uncertain at the time and where different estimates that management reasonably could have used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  would have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
the company s most critical accounting estimates relate to the following adjustments to revenue  accounts receivable  inventories  and deferred tax assets and are discussed below 
because of the uncertainty inherent in these critical estimates  actual results could differ from such estimates and such differences could be material 
adjustments to revenue net revenue from wholesale product sales is recognized upon the transfer of title and risk of ownership to customers 
wholesale revenue is recorded net of discounts  as well as provisions for estimated returns  allowances and doubtful accounts 
on a seasonal basis  the company negotiates price adjustments with retailers as sales incentives or to partially reimburse them for the cost of certain promotions 
the company estimates the cost of such adjustments on an ongoing basis considering historical trends  projected seasonal results and an evaluation of current economic conditions 
these costs are recorded as a reduction to net revenue 
the company s estimates of these costs have historically been reasonably accurate 
accounts receivable in the normal course of business  the company grants credit directly to certain retail store customers 
accounts receivable are recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts based upon an analysis of the aging of accounts receivable at the date of the financial statements  assessments of collectibility based on historic trends and an evaluation of economic conditions 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost weighted average method or market 
substantially all inventories are comprised of finished goods 
the company continually evaluates its inventories by assessing slow moving current product as well as prior seasons inventory 
market value of non current inventory is estimated based on historical sales trends for this category of inventory of the company s individual product lines  the impact of market trends  an evaluation of economic conditions and the value of current orders relating to the future sales of this type of inventory 
deferred tax assets the company evaluates the probability of realizing its deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis 
this evaluation includes estimating the company s future taxable income in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which the company operates as well as the feasibility of tax planning 
table of contents 
index to financial statements strategies 
the company is required to provide a valuation allowance if it is determined to be more likely than not that the company will not be able to realize certain of its deferred tax assets 
for certain of the company s deferred tax assets  the company had previously determined that it was not more likely than not that these assets will be realized and recorded the appropriate valuation allowance 
should the company determine that it is more likely than not that it will realize certain of its deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment would be required to reduce the existing valuation allowance and increase income 
conversely  if the company should determine that an adjustment to increase the valuation allowance is required  such an adjustment would be charged to the results of operations in the period such conclusion was reached 
seasonality the company s business is impacted by the general seasonal trends characteristic of the apparel and retail industries 
the company s wholesale revenue  particularly that from its european operations  is generally highest during the second and fourth fiscal quarters  while the company s retail segment generally contributes its highest levels of revenue during the third fiscal quarter 
as the timing of wholesale product shipments and other events affecting the retail business may vary  results for any particular quarter might not be indicative of results for the full year 
inflation the company believes that inflation has not had a material effect on its net revenue or profitability in recent years 
exchange rates the company receives united states dollars for approximately of its product sales 
substantially all inventory purchases from contract manufacturers throughout the world are also denominated in united states dollars  however  purchase prices for the company s products may be impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the united states dollar and the local currencies of the contract manufacturers  which may have the effect of increasing the company s cost of goods in the future 
during the last three fiscal years  exchange rate fluctuations have not had a material impact on the company s inventory costs  however  due to the number of currencies involved and the fact that not all foreign currencies react in the same manner against the united states dollar  the company cannot quantify in any meaningful way the potential effect of such fluctuations on future income 
the company does not engage in hedging activities with respect to such exchange rate risk 
the company does  however  seek to protect against adverse movements in currency exchange rates which might affect certain firm commitments or transactions 
these include the purchase of inventory  capital expenditures  collection of foreign royalty payments and certain intercompany commitments 
the company enters into forward contracts  generally with maturities up to months  to sell or purchase foreign currency in order to hedge against such risks 
the company does not use financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
at march   the company had contracts to exchange foreign currencies  principally  the japanese yen  the euro and the canadian dollar  having a total notional amount of  no significant gain or loss was inherent in such contracts at march  gains or losses on such forward contracts are recognized in other comprehensive income on a mark to market basis and  ultimately  in earnings at the time the underlying hedge transaction is completed or recognized in earnings 
while a hypothetical adverse change in all of the relevant exchange
