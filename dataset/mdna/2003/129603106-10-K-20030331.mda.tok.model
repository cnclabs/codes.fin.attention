the activated carbon and service segments utilize activated carbon while the engineered solutions segment relies on other technologies 
the consumer segment integrates carbon products into commercial products for everyday use by consumers 
activated carbon 
the activated carbon segment involves the production and sale of a broad range of activated  impregnated or acid washed carbons  in powdered  granular or pellet form 
activated carbon is a porous material that removes organic compounds from liquids and gases by a process known as adsorption 
in adsorption organic molecules contained in a liquid or gas are attracted and bound to the surface of the pores of the activated carbon as the liquid or gas is passed through it 
the company also has a patented manufacturing process which enhances the catalytic functionality of activated carbon  expanding its capability to remove inorganic compounds  the product was introduced in and is called centaur 
the primary raw material used in the production of the company s activated carbons is bituminous coal which is crushed  mixed with pitch  sized and processed in low temperature bakers followed by high temperature furnaces 
this heating process is known as activation and develops the pore structure of the carbon 
through adjustments in the activation process  pores of the required size for a particular purification application are developed 
the company s technological expertise in adjusting the pore structure in the activation process has been one of the factors that has enabled the company to develop many special types of activated carbon 
currently  the company offers many types of activated carbon with most available in several particle sizes 
the company also markets other activated carbons including products based on coconut or wood which it purchases from independent suppliers 
although the company has historically concentrated on granular and pelletized activated carbon 
the company also manufactures powdered activated carbon  as a by product and or by crushing granular activated carbons 
granular activated carbon is generally used in fixed filter beds for continuous flow purification processes  while powdered activated carbon is generally used in batch purification processes 
use of fixed filter beds of activated carbon for continuous flow processing of a liquid or gas achieves a lower cost of operation and avoids the disposal costs associated with powdered carbon

the company believes it is presently in substantial compliance with these laws and regulations 
these laws and regulations are constantly evolving  and it is impossible to predict the effect these laws and regulations may have on the company in the future 
the environmental protection agency epa has issued certain regulations under the resource conservation and recovery act rcra dealing with the transportation  storage and treatment of hazardous waste that impact the company in its carbon reactivation services 
once activated carbon supplied to a customer can no longer adsorb contaminating organic substances  it is returned to the company s facilities for reactivation and subsequent reuse 
if the substance s adsorbed by the spent carbon is are considered hazardous  under these epa regulations the activated carbon used in the treatment process is also considered hazardous 
therefore  a permit is required to transport the hazardous carbon to the company s facility for reactivation 
the company possesses the necessary federal and state permits to transport hazardous waste 
once at the company s reactivation site  the hazardous spent activated carbon is placed in temporary storage tanks 
under the epa regulations  the company is required to have a hazardous waste storage permit 
the company has obtained rcra part b permits to store hazardous waste at its pittsburgh and catlettsburg facilities 
the process of reactivating the spent activated carbon  which destroys the hazardous organic substances  is subject to permitting as a thermal treatment unit under rcra 
the company has filed for these permits at its pittsburgh and catlettsburg facilities 
the company does not accept for reactivation carbons containing certain hazardous materials 
each of the company s domestic production facilities has permits and licenses regulating air emissions and water discharges 
all of the company s domestic production facilities are controlled under permits issued by local  state and federal air pollution control entities 
the company is presently in compliance with these permits 
continued compliance will require administrative control and will be subject to any new or additional standards 
in this regard  the company has agreed with the state of kentucky that it will temporarily discontinue operations of one of its three activated carbon lines at its catlettsburg  kentucky facility by may and will install additional control equipment before resuming operation of this line 
the activated carbon line and associated equipment has a net book value of approximately million 
management has not concluded the timing of its plan of action for compliance related to this activated carbon line 
however  if it is determined that a shutdown of the activated carbon line for other than a temporary period is warranted  current operating results may be adversely affected by increased depreciation or impairment charges 
the total cost of the control equipment required for compliance  if installed  is estimated at approximately million 
the company believes that the cessation of production of the activated carbon line  if temporary or permanent  will not have a material impact upon the company s ability to service the demands of its customers 
europe
