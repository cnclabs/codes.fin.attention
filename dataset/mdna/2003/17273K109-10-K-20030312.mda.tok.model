our representative networks offer technically trained sales forces with strong relationships to key markets without fixed costs to us 

table of contents we believe that our multifaceted and well established sales and distribution channels constitute a competitive strength  providing access to all of our markets 
we believe that we have good relationships with our representatives and distributors and we continue to implement marketing programs to enhance these relationships 
ongoing distribution enhancement programs include shortening shelf stock delivery  reducing assemble to order lead times  introducing new products  offering competitive pricing and increasing inventory turns 
manufacturing we have fully integrated and highly automated manufacturing capabilities including machining operations and assembly 
our machining operations feature computer controlled machine tools  high speed chucking machines and automatic screw machines for machining brass  iron and steel components 
we believe that our fully integrated manufacturing capabilities are essential in the valve industry in order to control product quality  to be responsive to customers custom design requirements and to ensure timely delivery 
product quality and performance are a priority for our customers  especially since many of our product applications involve caustic or volatile chemicals and  in many cases  involve processes that are used in the precise control of fluids 
we have implemented integrated enterprise wide software systems at most of our major locations to make operations more efficient and to improve communications with our suppliers and customers 
we are committed to maintaining our manufacturing equipment at a level consistent with current technology in order to maintain high levels of quality and manufacturing efficiencies 
as part of this commitment  we have spent a total of million  million  and million on capital expenditures for the years ended december    and  respectively 
depreciation expense for these periods was million  million  and million  respectively 
we believe that our current facilities will meet our near term production requirements without the need for additional facilities 
quality control the majority of our products require and have been approved by applicable industry standards agencies in the united states and european markets 
we have consistently advocated the development and enforcement of performance and safety standards  and are currently planning new investments and implementing additional procedures as part of our commitment to meet these standards 
we maintain quality control and testing procedures at each of our manufacturing facilities in order to produce products in compliance with these standards 
additionally  most of our major manufacturing subsidiaries have acquired iso  or certification from the international organization for standardization and  for those in the petrochemical products group  american petroleum institute certification 
our products are designed  manufactured and tested to meet the requirements of various government or industry regulatory bodies 
the primary industry standards that certain of our instrumentation and thermal fluid controls products must meet include standards promulgated by underwriters laboratory  american national standards institute  american society of mechanical engineers  us military  federal aviation administration  society of automotive engineers  boeing basic and advanced management system  aerospace quality assurance system  the american gas association  the department of transportation  and european pressure equipment directive ped and technical inspection association t v 
the primary industry standards required to be met by and applicable to our petrochemical products include american national standards institute  american society of mechanical engineers  american petroleum institute and factory mutual 
product development we continue to develop new and innovative products to enhance our market positions 
our product development capabilities include the ability to design and manufacture custom applications to meet high tolerance or close precision requirements 
for example  kf industries has fire safe testing capabilities  circle seal has the ability to meet the testing specifications of the aerospace industry and pibiviesse can meet the tolerance requirements of sub sea and cryogenic environments 
these testing and manufacturing capabilities have enabled us to develop customer specified applications  unique characteristics of which have been subsequently utilized in broader product offerings 
our 
table of contents research and development expenditures for the years ended december   and  were million  million  and million  respectively 
raw materials the raw materials used most often in our production processes are stainless steel  carbon steel  aluminum  bronze  and brass 
we purchase these materials from numerous suppliers and have not historically experienced significant difficulties in obtaining these commodities in quantities sufficient for our operations 
however  these materials are subject to price fluctuations that may adversely affect our results of operations 
historically  increases in the prices of raw materials have been partially offset by increased sales prices  active materials management  project engineering programs and the diversity of materials used in our production processes 
competition the domestic and international markets for our products are highly competitive 
some of our competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing  personnel and other resources than us 
we consider product quality  performance  price  distribution capabilities and breadth of product offerings to be the primary competitive factors in these markets 
we believe that new product development and product engineering are also important to our success and that our position in the industry is attributable  in significant part  to our ability to develop innovative products quickly  and to adapt and enhance existing products to specific customer applications 
the primary competitors of our instrumentation and thermal fluid controls products group include swagelok company  parker hannifin corporation  samson ag  spirax sarco engineering plc  flowseal a division of crane co  and fisher a division of emerson process management 
the primary competitors of our petrochemical products group include grove dresser valve a unit of first reserve corporation and odyssey investment partners  llc  cooper cameron corporation  apollo a unit of conbraco industries  inc  jamesbury  inc 
a division of metso usa which is part of the metso corporation  balon  and worcester controls corp 
a unit of flowserve 
trademarks and patents we own patents that are scheduled to expire between and and trademarks that can be renewed as long as we continue to use them 
we do not believe the vitality and competitiveness of either of our business segments as a whole depends on any one or more patents or trademarks 
we own certain licenses such as software licenses  but we also do not believe that our business as a whole depends on any one or more licenses 
customers  cyclicality and seasonality for the year ended december   revenues from one of our distributors in the petrochemical products segment amounted to million 
no other single customer accounted for more than of revenues for either the instrumentation and thermal fluid controls products group or the petrochemical products group 
we have experienced and expect to continue to experience fluctuations in revenues and operating results due to economic and business cycles 
our businesses  particularly the petrochemical products group  are cyclical in nature as the worldwide demand for oil and gas fluctuates 
when the worldwide demand for oil and gas is depressed  the demand for our products used in those markets declines 
future changes in demand for petrochemical products could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
similarly  although not to the same extent as the oil and gas markets  the aerospace  military and maritime markets have historically experienced cyclical fluctuations in demand that could also have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
backlog our total order backlog was million as of february   compared to million as of february  we expect all but million of the backlog at february  will be shipped by december  the change in our 
table of contents backlog was primarily due to increased orders for major oil and gas projects and thermal fluid controls products and the october acquisitions of tomco and us para plate 
these increases were partially offset by reductions to order backlog in our oklahoma manufacturing facility for petrochemical products as a result of decreased oil and gas drilling in north america 
employees as of december   our worldwide operations directly employed approximately  people  including employees at our suzhou kf valve joint venture in the people s republic of china 
we have employees in the united states who are covered by a single collective bargaining agreement 
we also have employees in italy  employees in france and employees in germany covered by governmental regulations or workers councils 
we believe that our employee relations are good at this time 
segment and geographic financial data financial information by segment and geographic area is incorporated herein by reference to part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report 
government regulation regarding the environment as a result of our manufacturing and assembly operations  our businesses are subject to federal  state  local and foreign laws  as well as other legal requirements relating to the generation  storage  transport and disposal of materials 
these laws include  without limitation  the resource conservation and recovery act  the clean air act  the clean water act and the comprehensive environmental response and compensation and liability act 
we currently do not anticipate any materially adverse impact on our business  financial condition or results of operations as a result of our compliance with federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws 
however  risk of environmental liability and charges associated with maintaining compliance with environmental laws is inherent in the nature of our manufacturing operations and there is no assurance that material liabilities or charges could not arise 
during the year ended december   we capitalized million related to environmental and safety control facilities 
we expect to capitalize million during the fiscal year ending december  we also incurred and expensed million of charges during the year ended december  we expect to incur and expense million in the fiscal year ending december  item properties we maintain major facilities worldwide  including manufacturing operations located in the united states  canada  western europe and the people s republic of china 
many of these facilities contain sales offices or warehouses from which we ship finished goods to customers  distributors and commissioned representative organizations 
our executive office is located in burlington  massachusetts 
the instrumentation and thermal fluid controls products group has facilities located in the united states  canada  germany  france  and the united kingdom 
properties in ronkonkoma  new york  berlin  connecticut  spartanburg  south carolina  and auburn  california are leased 
the petrochemical products group has facilities located in the united states  canada  italy and the people s republic of china 
properties in nerviano  italy  naviglio  italy  edmonton  canada  a distribution center in oklahoma city  oklahoma  and suzhou  people s republic of china are leased 
certain of our facilities are subject to mortgages and collateral assignments under loan agreements with long term lenders 
in general  we believe that our properties  including machinery  tools and equipment  are in good condition  are well maintained  and are adequate and suitable for their intended uses 
our manufacturing facilities generally operate five days per week on one or two shifts 
we believe our manufacturing capacity could be increased by working additional shifts and weekends 
this utilization is subject to change as a result of increases or decreases in orders 

table of contents item legal proceedings we  like other worldwide manufacturing companies  are subject to a variety of potential liabilities connected with our business operations  including potential liabilities and expenses associated with possible product defects or failures and compliance with environmental laws 
we maintain million in aggregate product liability insurance and million under an excess umbrella liability insurance policy 
we also maintain a separate product liability policy with aggregate limits of million for the aviation products produced by our worldwide operations 
we believe this coverage to be consistent with industry practices 
nonetheless  such insurance coverage may not be adequate to protect us fully against substantial damage claims  which may arise from product defects and failures or from environmental liability 
like many other manufacturers of fluid control products  we have been named as defendants in a growing number of product liability actions brought on behalf of individuals who seek compensation for their alleged exposure to airborne asbestos fibers 
in particular  leslie  spence  and hoke  all subsidiaries of circor  collectively have been named as defendants or third party defendants in asbestos related claims brought on behalf of approximately  plaintiffs against anywhere from to defendants 
in some instances  circor also has been named as successor in interest to one or more of these subsidiaries 
these cases have been brought in state courts in california  connecticut  maryland  michigan  mississippi  new jersey and new york  with the vast majority of claimants having brought their claims in mississippi 
the cases brought on behalf of the vast majority of claimants seek unspecified compensatory and punitive damages against all defendants in the aggregate 
however  with respect to the complaints filed on behalf of approximately plaintiffs in new york  each plaintiff seeks million compensatory damages and million punitive damages against the aggregate of defendants under each of six causes of action 
similarly  with respect to the complaints filed in california on behalf of eleven claimants  each plaintiff seeks approximately  compensatory damages and million punitive damages against the aggregate of defendants 
and  with respect to approximately  claimants in mississippi  each such claimant seeks approximately million compensatory damages and million punitive damages against the aggregate of defendants 
any components containing asbestos formerly used in leslie  spence and hoke products were entirely internal to the product and  we believe  would not give rise to ambient asbestos dust during normal operation 
as such  we believe that we have minimal  if any  liability with respect to the vast majority of these cases and that these cases  in the aggregate  will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
however  due to the nature and number of variables associated with asbestos related claims  such as the rate at which new claims may be filed  the availability of insurance policies to continue to recover certain of our costs relating to the defense and payment of these claims  the impact of bankruptcies of other companies currently or historically defending asbestos claims  including our co defendants  the uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case  the impact of potential changes in legislative or judicial standards  the type and severity of the disease alleged to be suffered by each claimant  and increases in the expense of medical treatment  we are unable to reliably estimate the ultimate costs to us of these claims 
as we previously have disclosed  we learned on july  that the united states customs service customs had commenced an investigation to determine whether our subsidiary kf industries  inc kf was then in compliance with country of origin marking requirements on those valves that kf imports from sources in the people s republic of china including our joint venture there 
we believe that customs is concluding its investigation and are hopeful that we will be able to achieve resolution of this matter in the near future 
in this regard  although we continue to believe that any such resolution will not result in any material financial impact  we cannot provide any assurances regarding the timing or nature of such a resolution 
moreover  if the investigation were to prove that violations of the customs laws occurred  kf could be subjected to civil fines  forfeitures and if such violations were determined to be intentional criminal penalties  which could be material 
we are currently a party to or otherwise involved in various administrative or legal proceedings under federal  state or local environmental laws or regulations involving a number of sites  in some cases as a participant in a group of potentially responsible parties  referred to as prps 
two of these sites  the sharkey and combe landfills in new jersey  are listed on the national priorities list 
with respect to the sharkey landfill in new jersey  we have been allocated 
table of contents of the remediation costs  an amount that is not material to us 
with respect to the combe landfill  we have settled both the federal government s claim and the state of new jersey s claim for an amount that is immaterial to us 
moreover  our insurers have covered defense and settlement costs to date with respect to the sharkey and combe landfills 
in addition  we have also been named as a prp with respect to the solvent recovery service of new england site and the old southington landfill site  both in connecticut 
these sites are also on the national priorities list but  with respect to both sites  we have the right to indemnification from the prior owners of the affected subsidiaries 
we also have been identified as a prp with respect to the lightman drum company site in new jersey and  in this matter  we also have the right to indemnification from the former owners of the affected subsidiary 
based on currently available information  we believe that any share of clean up costs at these sites attributable to us will not be material  particularly given our indemnification rights against the respective former owners 
we have reviewed all of our pending judicial and legal proceedings  reasonably anticipated costs and expenses in connection with such proceedings  and availability and limits of our insurance coverage  and we have established reserves that we believe are appropriate in light of those outcomes that we believe are probable and estimable at this time 
item submission of matters to a vote of security holders there were no matters submitted during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year covered by this report to a vote of security holders through solicitation of proxies or otherwise

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this report contains certain statements that are forward looking statements as that term is defined under the private securities litigation reform act of the act and releases issued by the securities and exchange commission 
the words may  hope  will  should  expect  plan  anticipate  intend  believe  estimate  predict  potential  continue  and other expressions which are predictions of or indicate future events and trends and which do not relate to historical matters  identify forward looking statements 
we believe that it is important to communicate our future expectations to our stockholders  and we  therefore  make forward looking statements in reliance upon the safe harbor provisions of the act 
however  there may be events in the future that we are not able to accurately predict or control  and our actual results may differ materially from the expectations we describe in our forward looking statements 
forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors  which may cause our actual results  performance or achievements to differ materially from anticipated future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  the cyclicality and highly competitive nature of some of our end markets which can affect the overall demand for and pricing of our products  changes in the price of and demand for oil and gas in both domestic and international markets  variability of raw material and component pricing  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  our ability to continue operating our manufacturing facilities at efficient levels and to successfully implement our acquisition strategy  and the uncertain continuing impact on economic and financial conditions in the united states and around the world as a result of the september th terrorist attacks and related matters and current tensions in iraq and throughout the middle east 
we advise you to read further about certain of these and other risk factors set forth under the caption certain risk factors that may affect future results 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statement  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
basis of presentation all significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
certain prior period financial statement amounts have been reclassified to conform to currently reported presentations 
we monitor our business in two segments instrumentation and thermal fluid controls  and petrochemical products 
in march  we transferred ssi from the petrochemical products segment to the instrumentation and thermal fluid controls products segment 
we believe that this change better reflects the products and markets that ssi serves 
prior periods have been restated to reflect this transfer and net revenues  operating income and identifiable assets are not materially different with this reclassification 
critical accounting policies the following discussion of accounting policies is intended to supplement the section summary of significant accounting policies presented in note to our consolidated financial statements 
these policies were selected because they are broadly applicable within our operating units 
the expenses and accrued liabilities or allowances related to certain of these policies are initially based on our best estimates at the time of original entry in our accounting records 
adjustments are recorded when our actual experience  or new information concerning our expected experience  differs from underlying initial estimates 
these adjustments could be material if our actual or expected experience were to change significantly in a short period of time 
we make frequent comparisons of actual experience and expected experience in order to mitigate the likelihood of material adjustments 
revenue recognition and allowance for sales returns revenue is recognized when products are shipped and title has passed to the customer provided that no significant post delivery obligations remain and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
allowances for sales returns are recorded as a reduction of revenues based upon historical experience  return policies and contractual product return rights granted to customers 
adjustments to the allowance account are made as new information becomes available 
shipping and handling costs invoiced to customers are recorded as components of revenues and the associated costs are recorded as cost of sales 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts we estimate the collectibility of our accounts receivable and the amount of bad debts that may be incurred in the future 
we analyze specific customer accounts  historical experience  customer concentrations and relationships  credit ratings  and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
inventories inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or market value 
cost is generally determined on the first in  first out fifo basis 
where appropriate  standard cost systems are utilized for purposes of determining cost  the standards are adjusted as necessary to ensure they approximate actual costs 
estimates of the lower of cost or market value of inventory are determined at the operating unit level and are evaluated periodically 
estimates for obsolescence or unmarketable inventory are maintained based on current economic conditions  historical sales quantities and patterns and  in some cases  the specific risk of loss on specifically identified inventories 
such inventories are recorded at estimated realizable value net of the costs of disposal 
impairment of long lived assets effective january   we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  statement no 
 and as a result we no longer amortize goodwill 
statement no 
requires that a transitional impairment evaluation of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets be completed within six months of the date of adoption and then at least on an annual basis thereafter 
during the first half of  we completed our transitional impairment review and determined that there were no impairment losses related to goodwill and intangibles 
during the fourth quarter of  we completed our annual impairment evaluation of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets and again determined that there were no impairment losses 
in assessing the fair value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  projections regarding future cash flows and other factors are made to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or related projections change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges 
other long lived assets include property  plant  and equipment and intangibles with definite lives 
we perform impairment analyses of our other long lived assets whenever events and circumstances indicate that they may be impaired 
when the undiscounted future cash flows are expected to be less than the carrying value of the assets being reviewed for impairment  the assets are written down to fair market value 
taxes significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain state net operating losses and state tax credits carried forward 
the valuation allowance is based on estimates of taxable income in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
other reserves we establish reserves for other exposures  such as environmental claims  product liability and litigation costs 
establishing loss reserves for these matters requires the use of estimates and judgment in regards to risk exposure and ultimate liability 
we estimate such losses using consistent and appropriate methods  however  changes to our assumptions could materially affect our recorded liabilities for loss

we sell our products principally to oil  gas  petrochemical  process  power  aerospace  military  heating  ventilation and air conditioning  or hvac  maritime  pharmaceutical  medical and instrumentation markets 
although we serve a variety of markets to avoid a dependency on any one  a significant downturn in any one of these markets could cause a material reduction in our revenues that could be difficult to offset 
in particular  our petrochemical business is cyclical in nature as the worldwide demand for oil and gas fluctuates 
when worldwide demand for oil and gas is depressed  the demand for our products used in maintenance and repair of existing oil and gas applications  as well as exploration or new oil and gas project applications  is reduced 
as a result  we historically have generated lower revenues and profits in periods of declining demand for petrochemical products 
therefore  results of operations for any particular period are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for any future period 
future downturns in demand for petrochemical products could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
similarly  although not to the same extent as the oil and gas markets  the aerospace  military and maritime markets have historically experienced cyclical fluctuations in demand that also could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we face the continuing impact on economic and financial conditions in the united states and around the world as a result of the september th terrorist attacks and related matters  as well as current tensions in iraq and the rest of the middle east 
the terrorist attacks have negatively impacted general economic  market and political conditions 
in particular  the terrorist attacks  compounded with the slowing national economy  have resulted in reduced revenues in the aerospace and general industrial markets in fiscal year additional terrorist acts or acts of war wherever located around the world may cause damage or disruption to our business  our facilities  our joint venture partners or our employees which could significantly impact our business  financial condition or results of operations 
the potential for future terrorist attacks  the national and international responses to terrorist attacks  and other acts of war or hostility  including the current tensions in iraq and the middle east  have created many economic and political uncertainties  which could adversely affect our business and results of operations in ways that cannot presently be predicted 
in addition  with manufacturing facilities located worldwide  including facilities located in the united states  canada  western europe and the people s republic of china  we may be impacted by terrorist actions not only against the united states but in other parts of the world as well 
we are predominately uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war 
if we cannot continue operating our manufacturing facilities at current or higher levels  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
we operate a number of manufacturing facilities for the production of our products 
the equipment and management systems necessary for such operations may break down  perform poorly  or fail  resulting in fluctuations in manufacturing efficiencies 
such fluctuations may affect our ability to deliver products to our customers on a timely basis  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents we face significant competition in our markets and  if we are not able to respond to competition in our markets  our revenues may decrease 
we face significant competition from a variety of competitors in each of our markets 
some of our competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing  personnel and other resources than we do 
new competitors also could enter our markets 
we consider product quality  performance  price  distribution capabilities and breadth of product offerings to be the primary competitive factors in our markets 
our competitors may be able to offer more attractive pricing  duplicate our strategies  or develop enhancements to products that could offer performance features that are superior to our products 
competitive pressures  including those described above  and other factors could adversely affect our competitive position  involving a loss of market share or decreases in prices  either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  some of our competitors are based in foreign countries and have cost structures and prices based on foreign currencies 
accordingly  currency fluctuations could cause our us dollar priced products to be less competitive than our competitors products that are priced in other currencies 
if we experience delays in introducing new products or if our existing or new products do not achieve or maintain market acceptance  our revenues may decrease 
our industries are characterized by intense competition  changes in end user requirements  technically complex products  and evolving product offerings and introductions 
we believe our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to anticipate or adapt to these factors and to offer  on a timely basis  products that meet customer demands 
failure to develop new and innovative products or to custom design existing products could result in the loss of existing customers to competitors or the inability to attract new business  either of which may adversely affect our revenues 
the development of new or enhanced products is a complex and uncertain process requiring the anticipation of technological and market trends 
we may experience design  manufacturing  marketing or other difficulties  such as an inability to attract a sufficient number of qualified engineers  that could delay or prevent our development  introduction or marketing of new products or enhancements and result in unexpected expenses 
implementation of our acquisition strategy may not be successful  which could affect our ability to increase our revenues or could reduce our profitability 
one of our continued strategies is to increase our revenues and expand our markets through acquisitions that will provide us with complementary instrumentation and thermal fluid controls and petrochemical products 
we expect to spend significant time and effort in expanding our existing businesses and identifying  completing and integrating acquisitions 
we expect to face competition for acquisition candidates that may limit the number of acquisition opportunities available to us and may result in higher acquisition prices 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to identify  acquire or profitably manage additional companies or successfully integrate such additional companies without substantial costs  delays or other problems 
also  there can be no assurance that companies we acquire in the future will achieve revenues  profitability or cash flows that justify our investment in them 
in addition  acquisitions may involve a number of special risks  including adverse short term effects on our reported operating results  diversion of management s attention  loss of key personnel at acquired companies  or unanticipated management or operational problems or legal liabilities 
some or all of these special risks could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if we fail to manufacture and deliver high quality products  we may lose customers 
product quality and performance are a priority for our customers since many of our product applications involve caustic or volatile chemicals and  in many cases  involve processes that require precise control of fluids 
our products also are used in the aerospace  military  commercial aircraft  pharmaceutical  medical  analytical equipment  oil and gas exploration  transmission and refining  chemical processing  and maritime industries 
these industries require products that meet stringent performance and safety standards 
if we fail to maintain and enforce quality control and testing 
table of contents procedures  our products will not meet these stringent performance and safety standards 
substandard products would seriously harm our reputation  resulting in both a loss of current customers to our competitors and damage to our ability to attract new customers  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if we are unable to continue operating successfully overseas or to successfully expand into new international markets  our revenues may decrease 
we derive a significant portion of our revenue from sales outside the united states 
in addition  one of our key growth strategies is to market our products in international markets not currently served by us in portions of europe  latin america and asia 
we may not succeed in marketing  selling and distributing our products in these new markets 
moreover  conducting business outside the united states is subject to additional risks  including currency exchange rate fluctuations  changes in regional  political or economic conditions  trade protection measures such as tariffs or import or export restrictions  and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements 
one or more of these factors could prevent us from successfully expanding into new international markets and could also have a material adverse effect on our current international operations 
prices of our raw materials may increase which may adversely affect our business 
we obtain our raw materials for the manufacture of our products from third party suppliers 
we do not have contracts with many of these suppliers that require them to sell us the materials we need to manufacture our products 
historically  stainless steel  iron and carbon steel  in particular  have each increased in price as a result of increases in demand 
while in the past we have not experienced difficulties in obtaining the raw materials we require including stainless steel  cast iron and carbon steel  we cannot be certain that our suppliers will continue to provide us with the raw materials we need in the quantities requested or at a price we are willing to pay 
in the past we have been able to partially offset increases in the cost of raw materials by increased sales prices  active materials management  product engineering programs and the diversity of materials used in our production processes 
however  we cannot be certain that we will be able to accomplish this in the future 
since we do not control the actual production of these raw materials  we may also be subject to delays caused by interruption in production of materials for reasons we cannot control 
these include job actions or strikes by employees of suppliers  transportation interruptions and natural disasters or other catastrophic events 
our inability to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials for our products at favorable prices  or at all  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
a change in international governmental policies or restrictions could result in decreased availability and increased costs for certain components and finished products that we outsource  which could adversely affect our profitability 
like most manufacturers of fluid control products  we attempt  where appropriate  to reduce costs by seeking lower cost sources of certain components and finished products 
many such sources are located in developing countries such as the people s republic of china  india and taiwan where a change in governmental approach toward us trade could restrict the availability to us of such sources 
in addition  periods of war or other international tension could interfere with international freight operations and hinder our ability to take delivery of such components and products 
a decrease in the availability of these items could hinder our ability to meet timely our customers orders 
we attempt  when possible  to mitigate this risk by maintaining alternate sources for these components and products and by maintaining the capability to produce such items in our own manufacturing facilities 
however  even when we are able to mitigate this risk  the cost of obtaining such items from alternate sources or producing them ourselves is often considerably greater  and a shift toward such higher cost production could therefore adversely affect our profitability 
the costs of complying with existing or future environmental regulations  and of curing any violations of these regulations  could increase our expenses or reduce our profitability 
we are subject to a variety of environmental laws relating to the storage  discharge  handling  emission  generation  use and disposal of chemicals  solid and hazardous waste and other toxic and hazardous materials used to manufacture  or 
table of contents resulting from the process of manufacturing  our products 
we cannot predict the nature  scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing or future laws will be administered or interpreted 
future regulations could be applied to materials  products or activities that have not been subject to regulation previously 
the costs of complying with new or more stringent regulations  or with more vigorous enforcement of these or existing regulations could be significant 
environmental laws require us to maintain and comply with a number of permits  authorizations and approvals and to maintain and update training programs and safety data regarding materials used in our processes 
violations of these requirements could result in financial penalties and other enforcement actions 
we also could be required to halt one or more portions of our operations until a violation is cured 
although we attempt to operate in compliance with these environmental laws  we may not succeed in this effort at all times 
the costs of curing violations or resolving enforcement actions that might be initiated by government authorities could be substantial 
the costs of complying with existing or future governmental regulations applicable to our importing and exporting practices  and of curing any violations of these regulations  could increase our expenses  reduce our revenues or reduce our profitability 
we are subject to a variety of laws regarding our international trade practices including regulations issued by the united states customs service  the bureau of export administration  the department of state  and the department of treasury 
we cannot predict the nature  scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international trading practices might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted 
future regulations could limit the countries into which certain of our products may be sold or could restrict our access to and increase the cost of obtaining products from foreign sources 
in addition  actual or alleged violations of import export laws could result in enforcement actions and or financial penalties that could result in substantial costs 
we face risks from product liability lawsuits that may adversely affect our business 
we  like other manufacturers and distributors of products designed to control and regulate fluids and chemicals  face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products results in personal injury  property damage or business interruption to our customers 
we may be subjected to various product liability claims  including  among others  that our products include inadequate or improper instructions for use or installation  or inadequate warnings concerning the effects of the failure of our products 
although we maintain strict quality controls and procedures  including the testing of raw materials and safety testing of selected finished products  we cannot be certain that our products will be completely free from defect 
in addition  in certain cases  we rely on third party manufacturers for our products or components of our products 
although we have liability insurance coverage  we cannot be certain that this insurance coverage will continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost  or  if available  will be adequate to cover any such liabilities 
we generally seek to obtain contractual indemnification from our third party suppliers  and for us to be added as an additional insured party under such parties insurance policies 
any such indemnification or insurance is limited by its terms and  as a practical matter  is limited to the credit worthiness of the indemnifying or insuring party 
in the event that we do not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification  product liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
the costs associated with the defense of asbestos related claims and the payment of any judgments or settlements with respect to such claims are subject to a number of uncertainties 
as such  we cannot guarantee that such claims ultimately will not have an adverse effect on our financial statements  results of operations or cash flows 
like many other manufacturers of fluid control products  we have been named as defendants in a growing number of product liability actions brought on behalf of individuals who seek compensation for their alleged exposure to airborne asbestos fibers 
in general  any components containing asbestos formerly used in our products were entirely internal to the product and  we believe  would not give rise to ambient asbestos dust during normal operation 
as such  we believe that we have minimal  if any  liability with respect to the vast majority of these cases and that these cases  in the aggregate  will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
however  due to the nature and number of variables associated with asbestos related claims  such as the rate at which 
table of contents new claims may be filed  the availability of insurance policies to continue to recover certain of our costs relating to the defense and payment of these claims  the impact of bankruptcies of other companies currently or historically defending asbestos claims  the uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case  the impact of potential changes in legislative or judicial standards  the type and severity of the disease alleged to be suffered by each claimant  and increases in the expense of medical treatment  we are unable to reliably estimate the ultimate costs of these claims 
we may be responsible for certain historical liabilities in the event watts and its affiliates are ultimately unable to satisfy such liabilities 
until the spin off  we were a member of watts consolidated group for federal income tax purposes 
each member of the consolidated group is liable for the federal income tax liability of the other members of the group  as well as for pension and benefit funding liabilities of the other group members 
under federal law we continue to be contingently liable for these watts consolidated group liabilities for periods beginning before the spin off 
we entered into a distribution agreement with watts that allocates tax  pension and benefit funding liabilities between watts and us 
under this agreement  watts maintains full control and absolute discretion with regard to any combined or consolidated united states federal and state tax filings for periods through the spin off date 
watts also maintains full control and absolute discretion regarding common tax audit issues of such entities 
these arrangements may result in conflicts of interest with watts 
in addition  if watts is ultimately unable to satisfy its liabilities  we could be responsible for satisfying them  despite the distribution agreement 
we would be jointly and severally liable for watts federal income taxes resulting from the spin off if the internal revenue service  or irs  treats the spin off as a taxable distribution 
at the time of the spin off  watts received a ruling from the irs to the effect that  for united states federal income tax purposes  the spin off would be tax free to watts and its shareholders 
if the undertakings made to the irs regarding the spin off are not complied with or if representations made to the irs regarding the spin off were inaccurate  we could lose the benefit of the irs tax ruling and the irs could assert that the spin off was a taxable distribution 
in that case  under united states federal income tax law  we would be jointly and severally liable with watts for a material amount of federal income tax 
in our distribution agreement with watts  we agreed that we will be wholly responsible for that tax if it results from our act or omission  and watts will be wholly responsible for that tax if it results from watts act or omission 
under federal income tax law  however  we would be required to pay that tax if watts was unable to  regardless of the distribution agreement 
we depend on our key personnel and the loss of their services may adversely affect our business 
we believe that our success will depend on the continued employment of our senior management team and other key personnel 
if one or more members of our senior management team or other key personnel were unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions  our business could be seriously harmed 
in addition  if any of our key personnel joins a competitor or forms a competing company  some of our customers might choose to use the services of that competitor or those of a new company instead of our own 
other companies seeking to develop capabilities and products similar to ours may hire away some of our key personnel 
nonetheless  if we are unable to maintain our key personnel and attract new employees  the execution of our business strategy may be hindered and our growth limited 
various restrictions and agreements could hinder a takeover of us which is not supported by our board of directors or which is leveraged 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by laws  the delaware general corporation law and our shareholder rights plan contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control in a transaction that is not approved by our board of directors or that is on a leveraged basis or otherwise 
these include provisions creating a staggered board  limiting the shareholders powers to remove directors  and prohibiting shareholders from calling a special meeting or taking action by written consent in lieu of a shareholders meeting 
in 
table of contents addition  our board of directors has the authority  without further action by the shareholders  to set the terms of and to issue preferred stock 
issuing preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power of the owners of our common stock  including the loss of voting control to others 
additionally  we have adopted a shareholder rights plan providing for the issuance of rights that will cause substantial dilution to a person or group of persons that acquires or more of our shares of common stock  unless the rights are redeemed 
delaying or preventing a takeover could result in our shareholders ultimately receiving less for their shares by deterring potential bidders for our stock or assets 
our debt agreements limit our ability to issue equity  make acquisitions  incur debt  pay dividends  make investments  sell assets  merge or raise capital 
our senior note purchase agreement  dated october   and our revolving credit facility agreement  dated october  and most recently amended on december   govern our indebtedness to our lenders 
the debt agreements include provisions which place limitations on certain activities including our ability to issue shares of our common stock  incur additional indebtedness  create any liens or encumbrances on our assets or make any guarantees  make certain investments  pay cash dividends above certain limits  or dispose of or sell assets or enter into a merger or a similar transaction 
the trading price of our common stock may be volatile and investors in our common stock may experience substantial losses 
the trading price of our common stock may be volatile 
our common stock could decline or fluctuate in response to a variety of factors  including  but not limited to our failure to meet the performance estimates of securities analysts  changes in financial estimates of our revenues and operating results or buy sell recommendations by securities analysts  the timing of announcements by us or our competitors concerning significant product line developments  contracts or acquisitions or publicity regarding actual or potential results or performance  fluctuation in our quarterly operating results caused by fluctuations in revenue and expenses  substantial sales of our common stock by our existing shareholders  general stock market conditions  or other economic or external factors 
in addition  the stock market as a whole has recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities 
this type of litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management attention and resources 
our international activities expose us to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could adversely effect our results of operations and cash flows 
our international manufacturing and sales activities expose us changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
such fluctuations could result in our i paying higher prices for certain imported goods and services  ii realizing lower prices for any sales denominated in currencies other than us dollars  iii realizing lower net income  on a us dollar basis  from our international operations due to the effects of translation from weakened functional currencies  and iv realizing higher costs to settle transactions denominated in other currencies 
any of these risks could adversely effect our results of operations and cash flows 
our major foreign currency exposures involve the markets in western europe  canada and asia 
we use forward contracts to manage the currency risk related to business transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
we primarily utilize forward exchange contracts with maturities of less than eighteen months 
to the extent these transactions are completed  the contracts do not subject us to significant risk from exchange rate fluctuations because they offset gains and losses on the related foreign currency denominated transactions 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the oil and gas markets historically have been subject to cyclicality depending upon supply and demand for crude oil  its derivatives and natural gas 
when oil or gas prices decrease  expenditures on maintenance and repair decline rapidly and outlays for exploration and in field drilling projects decrease and  accordingly  demand for valve products is reduced 
however  when oil and gas prices rise  maintenance and repair activity and spending for facilities projects normally increase  and we benefit from increased demand for valve products 
however  oil or gas price increases may be considered temporary in nature  or not driven by customer demand and  therefore  may result in longer lead times for increases in petrochemical sales orders 
as a result  the timing and magnitude of changes in market demand for oil and gas valve products are difficult to predict 
similarly  although not to the same extent as the oil and gas markets  the aerospace  military and maritime markets have historically experienced cyclical fluctuations in demand that also could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
interest rate sensitivity risk as of december   our primary interest rate risk is related to borrowings under our revolving credit facility and our industrial revenue bonds 
the interest rates for our revolving credit facility and industrial revenue bonds fluctuate with changes in short term borrowing rates 
there were no borrowings under our revolving credit facility outstanding as of december  based upon expected levels of borrowings under our credit facility in and our current balances for industrial revenue bonds  an increase in variable interest rates of basis points would not have a material effect on our results of operations or cash flows 
currency exchange risk we use forward contracts to manage the currency risk related to business transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
related gains and losses are recognized when the contracts expire  which are generally in the same period as the underlying foreign currency denominated transactions 
to the extent these transactions are completed  the contracts do not subject us to significant risk from exchange rate movements because they offset gains and losses on the related foreign currency denominated transactions 
as of december   we had forward contracts to buy foreign currencies with a face value of million 
these contracts mature on various dates between january and march net unrealized gains attributable to foreign currency forward contracts were less than million at december  and million at december  the counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions 
our risk of loss in the event of non performance by the counterparties is not significant 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
risk management strategies are reviewed and approved by senior management before implementation 
commodity price risk the primary raw materials used in our production process are stainless steel  carbon steel  cast iron and brass 
we purchase these materials from numerous suppliers nationally and internationally  and have not historically experienced significant difficulties in obtaining these commodities in quantities sufficient for our operations 
however  these commodities are subject to price fluctuations that may adversely affect our results of operations 
we manage this risk by offsetting increases in commodities with increased sales prices  active materials management  product engineering programs and the diversity of materials used in our production processes
