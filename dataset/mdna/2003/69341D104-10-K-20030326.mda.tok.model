item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview in january  we obtained fda approval to market our second generation laser  the hl the hl is less than half the weight and size of our first generation laser  the hl  but delivers the equivalent laser energy  wavelength and beam characteristics 
the hl and the hl collectively are referred to throughout this report as the heart laser systems 
in january  we entered into a strategic marketing alliance and exclusive distribution arrangement with edwards 
under this arrangement  edwards is marketing and distributing the hl  as well as all disposable tmr kits and accessories  to customers in the us in  edwards sales force was principally responsible for driving increased tmr procedures and kit utilization  as well as providing our capital sales force with hl sales leads 
we maintained our capital sales force through january to assist edwards in marketing the hl in the us in january  edwards exercised a pre existing option to assume full sales and marketing responsibility in the us for our hl and associated tmr kits 
we sell the hl and tmr kits to edwards at a discount to list price and edwards remarkets the hl and tmr kits to hospitals 
we benefited from reduced sales and marketing expenses in  and we expect these savings to continue in and beyond 
critical accounting policies our financial statements are based on the application of significant accounting policies  many of which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of our accounting policies that currently affect our financial condition and results of operations 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
a specific obsolescence allowance is provided for slow moving  excess and obsolete inventory based on management s best estimate of the net realizable value of inventory on hand 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts reflects management s best estimate of probable losses inherent in the account receivable balance 
management determines the allowance based on known troubled accounts  historical experience  and other currently available evidence 
warranty and preventative maintenance costs we warranty our products against manufacturing defects under normal use and service during the warranty period 
we obtain similar warranties from a majority of our suppliers  including those who supply critical heart laser system components 
in addition  under the terms of our distribution agreement with edwards  we are able to bill edwards for actual warranty costs  including preventative maintenance services  up to a specified amount during the warranty period 
management evaluates the estimated future unrecoverable costs of warranty and preventative maintenance services for our installed base of lasers on a quarterly basis and adjusts our warranty reserve accordingly 
management considers all available evidence  including historical experience and information obtained from supplier audits 
in  based upon this experience  we determined that the rate of heart laser system failure and cost per failure were lower than previously expected 
as a consequence  during the third and fourth quarters of  we reduced our warranty accrual by approximately  revenue recognition we record revenue from the sale of tmr kits to edwards at the time of shipment 
heart laser systems are billed to edwards in accordance with purchase orders received by us 
invoiced heart laser systems are recorded as other current assets and deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheet until such time as the laser is shipped to a hospital  at which time we record revenue and cost of revenue 
under the terms of the edwards distribution agreement  once edwards has recovered a prescribed amount of revenue from a hospital for the use or purchase of a laser  any additional revenues earned by edwards are shared with us pursuant to a formula established in the distribution agreement 
we only record our share of such additional revenue  if any  at the time the revenue is earned 
we record revenue from the sale of tmr kits and heart laser systems to international distributors or hospitals at the time of shipment 
we generally require our international customers to secure heart laser system sales through cash deposits and letters of credit 
prior to entering into the edwards distribution agreement  we installed heart laser systems in hospitals under placement contracts that did not transfer substantial ownership of the equipment to the customer 
revenues from these transactions are recognized over the life of the placement agreement in accordance with the specific terms of the contract 
revenues from service and maintenance contracts are recognized ratably over the life of the contract 
installation revenues related to a heart laser system transaction are recorded as a component of placement and service fees when the heart laser system is installed 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenues of  for the year ended december  decreased  or when compared to total revenues of  for the year ended december  this decrease was the result of a decrease in product sales and a decrease in placement and service fees 
product sales for the year ended december   product sales of  decreased  or when compared to product sales of  for the year ended december  heart laser system revenues  the largest component of product sales  increased by  in as compared to this increase is primarily attributable to an  increase in domestic heart laser system revenues 
the  increase in domestic heart laser system revenues was due to an increase in the number of heart laser system sales  a higher average domestic selling price on heart laser system sales and increased revenue sharing earned under the distribution agreement with edwards 
the  increase in domestic heart laser system revenues was partially offset by a  decrease in revenue generated from international heart laser system sales 
disposable tmr kit revenues  the second largest component of product sales  decreased by  in as compared to this decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in the average domestic sales price of tmr kits sold to edwards 
this decrease in the average sales price of tmr kits sold to edwards took effect in january when edwards exercised a pre existing option to assume full sales and marketing responsibility for the hl and associated tmr kits in the us in connection with this option exercise by edwards  edwards will  pursuant to the terms of the distribution agreement with us  retain a greater share of the revenue generated from us tmr kit sales 
royalty revenue  a component of product sales  decreased  in as compared to this decrease is due to a decline in the guaranteed minimum royalties due from cardiogenesis 
minimum royalties were in effect throughout all of  but only the first two quarters of although cardiogenesis is required to pay an ongoing royalty on actual sales of covered products after june   we expect that until such time  if ever  that cardiogenesis obtains fda approval for its pmr device  and provided that device remains a covered product under the terms of the license agreement  royalty revenue will be insignificant 
placement and service fees for the year ended december   placement and service fees of  decreased  or when compared to placement and service fees of  for the year ended december  service fees increased  in as compared to due to more domestic lasers in service throughout  which resulted in increased billings to edwards for installation  warranty and preventative maintenance services 
placement fees declined  in as compared to approximately  of this  decline is attributable to a reduction in domestic placement fees 
the  reduction in domestic placement fees is in part the result of various us hl customers upgrading to the newer hl each upgrade resulted in a laser sale to edwards and a corresponding shift in recorded disposable tmr kit sales to these new hl customers as product sales instead of placement fees 
the remaining  of the  decline was the result of lower international placement contract fees due to decreased kit shipments to international placement contract customers 
gross profit total gross profit was  or of total revenues for the year ended december  as compared with gross profit of  or of total revenues for the year ended december  the improvement in gross profit in as compared to is due to a higher average selling price and additional shared revenue on heart laser system transactions  manufacturing cost savings and improved product yields  lower depreciation charges  a reevaluation of estimated future warranty costs related to our installed base of lasers that resulted in  of non recurring income being reflected as an offset to cost of product sales and an increase in service related revenues 
these increases were offset in part by lower overall disposable tmr kit revenues  placement contract revenues and royalty revenues 
operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses of  for the year ended december  decreased  or when compared with selling  general and administrative expenses of  for the year ended december  the overall decrease is primarily attributable to significantly reduced domestic sales and marketing expenditures as a result of the january exercise by edwards of a pre existing option to assume the us sales and marketing responsibility for the hl and associated tmr kits  reduced international sales and marketing expenditures and reduced administrative expenditures 
in  selling  general and administrative expenses are expected to remain at levels similar to those in research and development expenses of  for the year ended december  decreased  or when compared with research and development expenses of  for the year ended december  there were no significant changes in any particular research and development expense related accounts 
in  research and development expenses are expected to remain at levels similar to those in other income other income of  for the year ended december  decreased  or when compared to other income of  for the year ended december  this decrease is a result of both a lower overall average investable balance and lower interest rates on invested funds 
in  other income is expected to remain at levels similar to those in net income loss we recorded a net profit of  for the year ended december  compared to a net loss of  for the year ended december  the net profit in resulted primarily from higher gross margins and reduced operating expenses as compared to  as discussed above 
there was no provision for income tax for the year ended december   despite a recorded net profit of  due to us net operating loss carryforwards being available to reduce taxable income 
there was no provision for income tax in due to a net loss of kit shipments our management monitors disposable kit shipments as an important metric in evaluating its business 
management believes kit shipments  although not a direct measure  are reasonable indicators of the pace of the adoption of tmr as a therapy in the marketplace 
for the year ended december   a total of  disposable kits were shipped to end users  an increase of over the  disposable kits shipped to end users during the year ended december  domestic kit shipments increased by  from  in to  in management believes the increase in domestic kit shipments is due primarily to an increase in the total number of installed lasers in and lasers installed and available for only a portion of being available for all of international kit shipments declined slightly from in to in the international market has had limited resources and programs to drive procedural adoption 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenues of  for the year ended december  decreased  or when compared to total revenues of  for the year ended december  this decrease was the result of a decrease in placement and service fees  partially offset by a increase in product sales 
product sales for the year ended december   product sales of  increased  or when compared to product sales of  for the year ended december  heart laser system revenues  the largest component of product sales  increased by  in as compared to this increase was due to an increase in the number of heart laser system sales  partially offset by a lower average selling price 
lower selling prices are a direct result of our distribution arrangement with edwards  pursuant to which products are sold at a discount to list price to edwards and then remarketed by edwards to hospitals 
disposable tmr kit revenues  the second largest component of product sales  increased by  in as compared to prior to  we recorded disposable kit revenues either as product sales if the disposable kit was shipped to a customer which had either purchased their heart laser system or which otherwise qualified for sales type lease treatment or as placement fees if the disposable kit was shipped to a customer with a placement contract 
in  all domestic disposable kit shipments were accounted for as product sales because all kits were sold directly to edwards 
placement and service fees for the year ended december   placement and service fees of  decreased  or when compared to placement and service fees of  for the year ended december  the overall decrease in placement and service fees reflects a decline in placement fees  partially offset by a increase in service fees 
service fees increased  in as compared to  primarily due to more domestic lasers being placed in service throughout  which resulted in increased billings to edwards for installation  warranty and preventative maintenance services 
placement fees declined  in as compared to approximately  of this  decline is attributable to a reduction in domestic placement fees 
the  reduction in domestic placement fees is in part the result of various us hl customers upgrading to the newer hl this resulted in a laser sale to edwards and a corresponding shift in recorded disposable tmr kit sales to these new hl customers as product sales instead of placement fees 
the remaining  of the  decline was the result of lower international placement contract fees due to decreased kit shipments to international placement contract customers 
gross profit total gross profit was  or of total revenues for the year ended december  as compared with gross profit of  or of total revenues for the year ended december  the lower gross profit in is primarily due to a non recurring charge of  which we incurred in the fourth quarter of to write down the value of our hl inventory and capital equipment due to the transition to the new hl product 
without this charge  our gross profit would have been of revenues in the decrease in gross profit in as compared to gross profit in is a result of lower selling prices of our products as well as lower overall sales partially offset by lower production costs for the hl operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses of  for the year ended december  decreased  or when compared with selling  general and administrative expenses of  for the year ended december  the decrease is mainly attributable to decreases in corporate marketing expenditures  both domestically and internationally  and lower general and administrative expenditures  including reductions in directors fees and travel  depreciation and amortization and salaries and related fringe benefit expenses 
research and development expenses of  for the year ended december  decreased  or when compared with research and development expenses of  for the year ended december  the reduction is a result of decreased hl engineering related project expenditures as this product transitioned into production in early and reductions in clinical study expenses 
other income other income of  for the year ended december  decreased  or when compared to other income of  for the year ended december  the decrease is a result of lower interest rates on invested funds 
net loss we incurred a net loss of  for the year ended december  compared with a net loss of  for the year ended december  the lower net loss resulted from higher gross margins  which is primarily due to a non recurring charge of  which we incurred in the fourth quarter of to write down the value of our hl inventory and capital equipment due to the transition to the new hl product  as well as reduced operating expenses 
there was no provision for income tax for the years ended december  or due to net losses of  and  respectively 
kit shipments for the year ended december   we shipped a total of  disposable kits to end users  a decrease of over the  disposable kits shipped to end users during the year ended december  domestic kit shipments increased by  from  in to  in management believes the domestic kit shipment improvement is a result of the benefits of the strategic partnership with edwards and the introduction of the new hl in january international kit shipments declined from in to in this decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in the number of international heart laser system shipments  which typically are accompanied by an initial kit order  as well as a reduction in the number of tmr procedures being performed in various international accounts 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of during the year ended december   we recorded net income of  and generated  from operating activities 
cash provided by financing activities was approximately  primarily consisting of the net proceeds of  obtained from sales of our common stock offset by a  reduction in secured borrowings 
we believe that our existing cash resources will meet our working capital requirements through december  however  we are largely dependent on the success of edwards sales and marketing efforts in the us to continue to increase the installed base of hl lasers and substantially increase tmr procedural volumes and revenues 
should the installed base of hl lasers or tmr procedural volume not increase sufficiently  our liquidity and capital resources will be negatively impacted 
additionally  other unanticipated decreases in operating revenues or increases in expenses or further changes or delays in third party reimbursement to healthcare providers using our products may adversely impact our cash position and require further cost reductions or the need to obtain additional financing 
it is not certain that we  working with edwards and our international distributors  will be successful in achieving broad commercial acceptance of the heart laser systems  or that we will be able to operate profitably on a consistent basis 
some hospital customers prefer to acquire the heart laser systems on a usage basis rather than as a capital equipment purchase 
we believe this is the result of limitations many hospitals currently have on acquiring expensive capital equipment as well as competitive pressures in the marketplace 
a usage business model may result in a longer recovery period for edwards to recoup its investment in lasers it purchases from us 
this could result in a delay in our ability to receive additional shared revenue  if any  that we otherwise are entitled to receive under the terms of our distribution agreement with edwards see critical accounting policies revenue recognition and a delay in the purchase of new lasers by edwards if its installed base of placement lasers under usage contracts are under performing and it chooses to re deploy these lasers to other new hospital sites in lieu of purchasing a new laser from us 
our cash position and our need for additional financing to fund operations will be dependent in part upon the number of hospitals that acquire heart laser systems from edwards on a usage basis and the number and frequency of tmr procedures performed by these hospitals 
we cannot predict whether a usage based sales model will be successful  whether implemented by us or edwards 
there can be no assurance that  should we require additional financing  such financing will be available on terms and conditions acceptable to us 
should additional financing not be available on terms and conditions acceptable to us  additional actions may be required that could adversely impact our ability to continue to realize assets and satisfy liabilities in the normal course of business 
the consolidated financial statements set forth in this annual report do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects of these uncertainties 
contractual obligations our long term contractual commitments consist of operating leases for our facilities in zug  switzerland  and franklin  massachusetts that expire in september and august  respectively 
future annual minimum payments under these operating leases are minimum operating lease obligations year s amount total operating lease obligations  in addition to amounts accrued or payable as of december   we have purchase commitments to make payments to suppliers totaling approximately  during risk factors the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that are currently deemed immaterial may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected 
our company has a history of operating losses plc systems inc was founded in prior to when we recorded a net profit  we had incurred operating losses in every year of our existence except we incurred net losses of  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of  we have only just recently achieved profitability  and we cannot provide any assurance that we will continue to be profitable in the future 
moreover  although our business is not seasonal in nature  our revenues may tend to vary significantly from fiscal quarter to fiscal quarter 
our company is dependent on one principal product line we develop and market one principal product line  which consists of two patented high powered carbon dioxide laser systems  known as the heart laser systems  and related tmr disposable kits 
approximately and of our revenues in the years ended december  and december   respectively  were derived from the sales and service of our heart laser systems and related disposables 
our company is dependent on one principal customer pursuant to a distribution agreement with edwards  edwards is our exclusive distributor for our hl and tmr kits in the us as a result of this relationship  edwards accounted for of our total revenue in the fiscal year ended december   and we expect edwards to account for the majority of our revenue in the future 
if our relationship with edwards does not progress or if edwards sales and marketing strategies fail to generate sales of our hl and tmr kits in the future  our revenue will decrease significantly and our business  financial condition and results of operations will be seriously harmed 
our company is dependent on certain suppliers some of the components for our laser systems  most notably the power supply and certain optics and fabricated parts  are only available from one supplier  and we have no assurance that we will be able to source any of our sole sourced components from additional suppliers 
in the past  we have experienced delays in product delivery from our sole suppliers and  because we do not have an alternative supplier to produce these products for us  we have little leverage to enforce timely delivery 
any delay in product delivery or other interruption in supply from these suppliers could prevent us from meeting our commercial demands for the heart laser systems  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  we do not require significant quantities of any components because we produce a limited number of heart laser systems each year 
our low quantity needs may not generate substantial revenue for our suppliers 
therefore  it may be difficult for us to continue our relationships with our current suppliers or establish relationships with additional suppliers on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
we have limited manufacturing experience building the hl we only began manufacturing the hl in the hl is based on a different design than the hl in order to achieve certain manufacturing cost savings  we have taken a more vertically integrated approach to the manufacture of the hl than we did with the hl as a result  we may experience manufacturing difficulties  including but not limited to shortages in component parts due to supplier manufacturing or procurement delays  supplier quality problems  lack of experienced technical personnel  low production yields  and changing processes and controls over the manufacturing procedures employed 
if we are unable to successfully manufacture the hl in a timely manner  we may lose customers  and our business  financial condition and results of operations may be seriously harmed 
our company may be unable to raise needed funds as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents totaling  based on our current operating plan  we anticipate that our existing capital resources should be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements through december  however  if our business does not progress in accordance with our current business plan  we may need to raise additional funds 
we may not be able to raise additional capital upon satisfactory terms  or at all  and our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
to the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity or convertible securities  ownership dilution to our stockholders will result 
in order to compete effectively  our heart laser systems need to gain commercial acceptance tmr is a new technology that is only recently becoming known 
our products may never achieve widespread commercial acceptance 
to be successful  we need to demonstrate to the medical community in general  and to heart surgeons and cardiologists in particular  that tmr procedures and the heart laser systems are effective  relatively safe and cost effective  support third party efforts to document the medical processes by which tmr procedures relieve angina  if any  have more heart surgeons trained to perform tmr procedures using the heart laser systems  and obtain widespread third party reimbursement for the tmr procedure 
to date  only a limited number of heart surgeons have been trained  and we are dependent on edwards to expand tmr related marketing and training efforts in the us although the heart laser systems have received fda approval and the ce mark  they have not yet received widespread commercial acceptance 
if we are unable to maintain regulatory approvals or to achieve widespread commercial acceptance of the heart laser systems  our business  financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected 
results of a recent clinical study may adversely affect our business our business may continue to be adversely affected by a clinical study  the results of which were released on october  at the transcatheter therapeutics conference 
the clinical study  which used a johnson johnson holmium pmr laser  demonstrated no significant differences in the clinical outcomes measured between patients receiving pmr therapy and patients in the control group 
the principal investigator of the clinical study concluded that the similar outcomes in patients in the treatment group and patients in the control group suggests a strong placebo effect  as opposed to any real therapeutic benefit from the pmr laser revascularization procedure 
although we believe that there are distinct clinical differences and therapeutic outcomes between a surgical laser tmr procedure and an interventional laser pmr procedure  the negative publicity resulting from the clinical study with respect to all laser revascularization procedures  including our co laser tmr approach  makes it more challenging for us to distinguish our surgical tmr from pmr and to distinguish our co laser from holmium lasers 
if we or edwards are unable to distinguish these procedures and therapies  the heart laser systems may never gain broad commercial acceptance and  therefore  our business will be materially and adversely affected 
rapid technological changes in our industry could make the heart laser systems obsolete our industry is characterized by rapid technological change and intense competition 
new technologies and products and new industry standards will develop at a rapid pace  which could make the heart laser systems obsolete 
the advent of new devices and procedures and advances in new drugs and genetic engineering are especially threatening 
our future success will depend upon our ability to develop and introduce product enhancements to address the needs of our customers 
material delays in introducing product enhancements may cause customers to forego purchases of our product and purchase those of our competitors 
many potential competitors have substantially greater financial resources and are in a better financial position to exploit marketing and research and development opportunities 
our current competitor in the tmr market  cardiogenesis  uses a different type of laser holmium than we use in the heart laser systems  and we have no assurance that our laser will be able to gain more widespread market acceptance 
in addition  cardiogenesis is attempting to obtain fda approval to market its pmr laser  which provides a less invasive method of creating channels in the heart 
if pmr can be shown to be safe and effective and is approved by the fda  it would eliminate the need in certain patients to make an incision in the chest  reducing costs and speeding recovery 
pmr and other new technologies and methods may erode the potential tmr market  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we must receive and maintain government approval in order to market our product the heart laser systems and our manufacturing activities are subject to extensive  rigorous and changing federal and state regulation in the us and to similar regulatory requirements in other major markets  including the european union and japan 
to date  we have received regulatory approval in the us and have the ability to market the heart laser systems in the european union excluding france 
we have not received regulatory approval in japan 
without regulatory approval  we cannot market the heart laser systems in japan 
even if granted  regulations may significantly restrict the use of the heart laser systems 
the process of obtaining and maintaining required regulatory approval is lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
united states although we have received fda approval  the fda has restricted the use of the heart laser systems and could reverse its approval at any time we received fda approval to market the hl and hl for tmr procedures in august and january  respectively 
however  the fda has not allowed us to market the heart laser systems to treat patients whose condition is amenable to conventional treatments  such as heart bypass surgery and angioplasty  and could reverse its ruling and prohibit use of the heart laser systems at any time 
europe although we have the ability to market our product in the european union  individual members of the european union could  and france has  prohibited commercial use of the heart laser systems we received the ce mark from the european union for the hl and hl in march and february  respectively 
however the european union could reverse its ruling and prohibit use of the heart laser systems at any time  we cannot market the heart laser systems in france  and other european union countries could prohibit or restrict use of the heart laser systems 
the french ministry of health instituted a commercial moratorium on tmr procedures in october in its opinion  the procedure is considered to be experimental and should only be performed within the context of a clinical study 
there can be no assurance that this moratorium will be lifted on a timely basis or at all 
asia we cannot market our product in major asian markets until we receive government approval we believe that japan represents the largest potential market for the heart laser systems in asia 
prior to marketing the heart laser systems in japan  we must receive approval from the japanese government 
this approval requires a clinical study in japan with at least patients 
a study was completed in with the hl although the results of this study have been submitted to the japanese government  we do not know whether the clinical study will be sufficient or when  if ever  we will receive approval to sell the hl in japan 
in addition  it is unclear what impact the introduction of the hl into the us and other international markets will have on our ability to market the hl in japan 
we could incur substantial costs defending against possible legal claims in the future we have been sued for alleged securities law violations in the past  and may be subject to similar claims or other claims in the future 
between august and november  we were named as defendant in class action lawsuits alleging violations of federal securities laws because we failed to obtain a favorable fda panel recommendation to market the hl nineteen of the claims were consolidated into a single action and some of the claims were dismissed in all remaining claims were settled in february the settlement of these claims did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
however  any future litigation or claims  whether or not valid  could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources with no assurance of success 
asserting and defending intellectual property rights may impact our results of operations in our industry  competitors often assert intellectual property infringement claims against one another 
the success of our business depends on our ability to successfully defend our intellectual property 
future litigation may have a material impact on our financial condition even if we are successful in marketing the heart laser systems 
we may not be successful in defending or asserting our intellectual property rights 
an adverse outcome in any litigation or interference proceeding could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties and require us to cease using the technology that is at issue or to license the technology from third parties 
in addition  a finding that any of our intellectual property is invalid could allow our competitors to more easily and cost effectively compete with us 
thus  an unfavorable outcome in any patent litigation or interference proceeding could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
the cost to us of any patent litigation or interference proceeding could be substantial 
uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or interference proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace 
patent litigation and interference proceedings may also absorb significant management time 
we may be subject to product liability lawsuits  our insurance may not be sufficient to cover damages we may be subject to product liability claims 
the united states supreme court has stated that compliance with fda regulations will not shield a company from commonlaw negligent design claims or manufacturing and labeling claims based on state rules 
such claims may absorb significant management time and could degrade our reputation and the marketability of the heart laser systems 
if product liability claims are made with respect to our products  we may need to recall the implicated product which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  although we maintain product liability insurance  we cannot be sure that our insurance will be adequate to cover potential product liability lawsuits 
our insurance is expensive and in the future may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if a successful product liability claim or series of claims exceeded our insurance coverage  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to risks associated with international operations a portion of our product sales are generated from operations outside of the us establishing  maintaining and expanding international sales can be expensive 
managing and overseeing foreign operations may be difficult and products may not receive market acceptance 
risks of doing business outside the us include  but are not limited to  the following agreements may be difficult to enforce and receivables difficult to collect through a foreign country s legal system  foreign customers may have longer payment cycles  foreign countries may impose additional withholding taxes or otherwise tax our foreign income  impose tariffs or adopt other restrictions on foreign trade  us export licenses may be difficult to obtain  and the protection of intellectual property in foreign countries may be more difficult to enforce 
there can be no assurance that our international business will grow or that any of the foregoing risks will not result in a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations 
because we are incorporated in canada  you may not be able to enforce judgments against us and our canadian directors under canadian law  you may not be able to enforce a judgment issued by courts in the us against us or our canadian directors 
the status of the law in canada is unclear as to whether a us citizen can enforce a judgment from a us court in canada for violations of us securities laws 
a separate suit may need to be brought directly in canada 
anti takeover provisions may prevent you from realizing a premium return provisions of canadian law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if the acquisition would be beneficial to you 
specifically  canadian law requires any person who makes a tender offer that would increase the person s stock ownership to more than of our outstanding common stock to make a tender offer for all of our common stock 
these provisions could prevent you from realizing the premium return that shareholders may realize in conjunction with corporate takeovers 
in addition  we have three classes of directors  with approximately one third elected each year for a three year term 
these provisions may have the effect of delaying or preventing a corporate takeover or a change in our management 
this could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
the market price of our stock may fall if other shareholders sell their stock certain current shareholders hold large amounts of our restricted stock  which they may be able to sell in the public market in the near future 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock within a short period of time could cause our stock price to fall 
in addition  the sale of these shares could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional stock 
the value of your common stock may decrease if other security holders exercise their options and warrants as shown in the table below  as of december   we have reserved an additional  shares of common stock for future issuance upon exercise of outstanding options  warrants and shares purchasable under an employee stock purchase plan 
range of exercise conversion prices weighted average exercise conversion price shares reserved for future issuance options 
 warrants  employee stock purchase plan  total  pursuant to an option exchange program we have instituted see note to the consolidated financial statements  we are committed to issue options to purchase  shares of our common stock at the then fair market value during march of we may issue additional options and warrants in the future 
if any of these securities are exercised  you may experience significant dilution in the market value of your common stock 
we may issue additional options and warrants in the future 
if any of these securities are exercised  you may experience significant dilution in the market value of your common stock 
we have no intention to pay dividends we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock 
we currently intend to retain all future earnings  if any  for use in our business and do not expect to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in forward looking statements this annual report and information incorporated by reference into this annual report contain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of forward looking statements deal with our current plans and expectations and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties 
statements containing terms such as believes  does not believe  plans  expects  intends  estimates  anticipates and other phrases of similar meaning are considered to contain uncertainty and are forward looking statements 
no forward looking statement is a guarantee of future performance 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements 
we have identified a number of important factors  including the risk factors identified above  that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our forward looking statements 
you should read these important factors as being applicable to all related forward looking statements  wherever they appear in this annual report  in the materials referred to in this annual report  in the materials incorporated by reference into this annual report or in our press releases 
you should not place undue reliance on any forward looking statement 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk a portion of our operations consists of sales activities in foreign jurisdictions 
we manufacture our products exclusively in the us and sell our products in the us and abroad 
as a result  our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we distribute our products 
our operating results are exposed to changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies  especially the swiss franc and the euro 
when the us dollar strengthens against the franc or euro  the value of foreign sales decreases 
when the us dollar weakens  the functional currency amount of sales increases 
no assurance can be given that foreign currency fluctuations in the future may not adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations  although at the present we do not believe that our exposure is significant 
our interest income and expense are sensitive to changes in the general level of us and foreign interest rates
