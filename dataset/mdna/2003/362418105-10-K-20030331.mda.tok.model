item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we are a reit focused within the multifamily industry in demand driven markets throughout the united states that have exhibited high job growth and resiliency to economic downturns 
our operating performance is based predominantly on net operating income from our apartment communities 
net operating income  which represents total property revenues less property operating and maintenance expenses as reflected in the consolidated statements of operations  is affected by the demand and supply dynamics within our markets 
our performance is also affected by the general availability and cost of capital and our ability to develop and acquire additional apartment communities with returns in excess of our long term weighted average cost of capital 
business objective and strategies our objective is to increase shareholder value by producing consistent high quality earnings to sustain dividends and annual total returns that exceed the nareit apartment index 
to achieve that objective  we employ a number of business strategies 
first  our long term investment strategy is research driven  with the objective of creating a portfolio of high quality assets in strategically selected markets that are complementary through economic diversity and characterized by high job growth and resiliency to national economic downturns 
we believe such a portfolio will provide predictable operating cash flow performance that exceeds the national average on a sustainable basis 
second  we adhere to a strategy of owning and operating high quality  class aa a apartment communities under the gables brand in established premium neighborhoods  or epns 
epns are generally characterized as areas with the highest prices for single family homes on a per square foot basis 
we believe that communities  when located in epns and supplemented with high quality service and amenities  attract the affluent renter by choice who is willing to pay a premium for location preference  superior service and high quality communities 
the resulting portfolio should maintain high levels of occupancy and rental rates relative to overall market conditions 
this  coupled with more predictable operating expenses and reduced capital expenditure requirements associated with high quality construction materials  should lead to operating margins that exceed national averages for the apartment sector and sustainable growth in operating cash flow 
third  our aim is to be recognized as the employer of choice within the industry 
our mission of taking care of the way people live involves innovative human resource practices that we believe will attract and retain the highest caliber associates 
because of our long established presence as a fully integrated apartment management  development  construction  acquisition and disposition company within our markets  we have the ability to offer multi faceted career opportunities among the various disciplines within the industry 
finally  our capital strategy is to generate a return on invested capital that exceeds our long term weighted average cost of capital while maintaining financial flexibility through a conservative  investment grade credit profile 
we judiciously manage our capital and are able to recycle existing capital through asset dispositions 
we believe we are well positioned to continue achieving our objectives because the markets we have selected for investment are projected to continue to experience job growth that exceed national averages  our epn locations are expected to outperform local market results and national demand for apartments is expected to increase during the next ten to fifteen years as the demographic group referred to as the echo boomer generation begins to form new households 
portfolio wide occupancy levels and rental rates have declined slightly as a result of national economic weakness  coupled with low mortgage rates which have resulted in an increase in home purchases by apartment residents 
we expect portfolio wide property operating and maintenance expenses for to increase over at a rate ahead of inflation due primarily to increases in insurance costs and property taxes 
in addition  we expect total property revenues on a same store basis in to be consistent with  or slightly lower than  results 
we expect that operating fundamentals for our business will improve as job growth improves in our markets 
the job growth prospects for our markets are partially related to national economic conditions 
it is uncertain whether  and to what extent  the national economy and related job growth will improve in our ongoing evaluation of the fair market value for a specific asset may result in a determination to dispose of the asset 
the net proceeds from any such sale may be used to invest in new assets expected to have better growth prospects  reduce indebtedness  repurchase outstanding common shares under our common equity repurchase program  or fund other liquidity needs 
we maintain staffing levels sufficient to meet our existing development  construction  acquisition and property operating activities 
when market conditions warrant  we adjust staffing levels in an attempt to mitigate a negative impact on our results of operations

management s discussion and analysis amounts in thousands  except property and per share data critical accounting policies and recent accounting pronouncements our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap and a summary of our significant accounting policies is included in notes and to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
notes and to the accompanying consolidated financial statements include a summary of recent accounting pronouncements and their actual or expected impact on our consolidated financial statements 
our preparation of the financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
our actual results may differ from these estimates 
as an owner  operator and developer of apartment communities  our critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition  cost capitalization and asset impairment evaluation 
revenue recognition rental we lease our residential properties under operating leases with terms generally equal to one year or less 
rental income is recognized when earned  which materially approximates revenue recognition on a straight line basis 
property management we provide property management services to third parties and unconsolidated joint ventures 
property management fees are recognized when earned 
ancillary services we provide development and construction  corporate rental housing and brokerage services to third parties and unconsolidated joint ventures 
development and construction services are typically provided under cost plus a fee contracts 
because our clients are obligated to fund the costs that are incurred on their behalf pursuant to the related contract  we net the reimbursement of these costs against the billings for such costs 
development and construction fees are recognized when earned using the percentage of completion method 
during the years ended december   and  we recognized million  million and million  respectively  in development and construction fees under related contracts with gross billings of million  million and million  respectively 
corporate rental housing revenues and brokerage commissions are recognized when earned 
gains on sales of real estate assets gains on sales of real estate assets are recognized pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate 
the specific timing of the recognition of the sale and the related gain is measured against the various criteria in sfas no 
related to the terms of the transactions and any continuing involvement associated with the assets sold 
to the extent the sales criteria are not met  we defer gain recognition until the sales criteria are met 
cost capitalization as a vertically integrated real estate company  we have in house investment professionals involved in the development  construction and acquisition of apartment communities 
direct internal costs associated with development and construction activities for wholly owned assets are included in the capitalized development cost of such assets 
direct internal costs associated with development and construction activities for third parties and unconsolidated joint ventures are reflected in ancillary services expense as the related services are being rendered 
as required by gaap  we expense all internal costs associated with the acquisition of operating apartment communities to general and administrative expense in the period such costs are incurred 
we maintain staffing levels sufficient to meet our existing development  construction and acquisition activities 
when market conditions warrant  we adjust staffing levels in an attempt to mitigate a negative impact on our results of operations 
our real estate development pursuits are subject to obtaining permits and other governmental approvals  as well as our ongoing business review of the underlying real estate fundamentals and the impact on our capital structure 
we do not always move forward with development of our real estate pursuits  and therefore  we evaluate the viability of real estate pursuits and the recoverability of capitalized pursuit costs regularly 
based on this periodic review  we expense any costs that are deemed unrealizable at that time to general and administrative expense 
during the development and construction of a new apartment community  we capitalize related interest costs  as well as other carrying costs such as property taxes and insurance 
we begin to expense these items as the construction of the community becomes substantially complete and the residential apartment homes become available for initial occupancy 
accordingly  we gradually reduce the amounts we capitalize as construction is being completed 
during the lease up period  as a community transitions from initial occupancy to stabilized occupancy  revenues are generally insufficient to cover interest  carrying costs and operating expenses 
the size and duration of this lease up deficit depends on how quickly construction is completed  how quickly the apartments available for occupancy are leased  and what rent levels are achieved at the community 
management s discussion and analysis amounts in thousands  except property and per share data asset impairment evaluation under gaap  real estate assets are stated at the lower of depreciated cost or fair value  if deemed impaired 
as noted above  the cost of buildings and improvements includes interest  property taxes  insurance and direct internal development and construction costs incurred during the construction period 
expenditures in excess of for purchases of a new asset with a useful life in excess of one year and for replacements and repairs that extend the useful life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over their useful lives 
recurring value retention capital expenditures are typically incurred every year during the life of a community and include such expenditures as carpet  flooring and appliances 
non recurring capital expenditures are costs that are generally incurred in connection with a major project impacting an entire community  such as roof replacement or parking lot resurfacing 
value enhancing capital expenditures are costs for which an incremental value is expected to be achieved and include such costs as amenity upgrades and additions and security gates 
recurring value retention and non recurring and or value enhancing capital expenditures do not include costs incurred in connection with a major renovation of an apartment community 
repairs and maintenance  such as landscaping maintenance  interior painting and cleaning and supplies used in such activities  are expensed as incurred 
depreciation is computed on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of to years for buildings and improvements and years for furniture  fixtures and equipment 
as required by gaap  we periodically evaluate our real estate assets to determine if there has been any impairment in their carrying value and record impairment losses if there are indicators of impairment and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amounts 
no such impairment losses have been recognized to date 
discontinued operations we adopted sfas no 
effective january  which requires  among other things  that the operating results of certain real estate assets which have been sold subsequent to january   or otherwise qualify as held for disposition as defined by sfas no 
 be reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented 
we sold three wholly owned operating real estate assets during the first quarter of and one wholly owned operating real estate asset during the fourth quarter of we retained management of two of the assets sold during the first quarter of due to our continuing involvement with the operations of the two assets sold that we are continuing to manage  the operating results of these assets are included in continuing operations 
the operating results for the two remaining wholly owned assets sold during the first and fourth quarters of for which we did not retain management are reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented 
interest expense has been allocated to the results of the discontinued operations in accordance with eitf no 
we had no assets that qualified as held for disposition as defined by sfas no 
at december  or results of operations comparison of operating results for the year ended december  to the year ended december  our net income is generated primarily from the operation of our apartment communities and the disposition of assets that no longer meet our investment criteria 
for purposes of evaluating comparative operating performance  we categorize our operating communities based on the period each community reaches stabilized occupancy 
a community is considered to have achieved stabilized occupancy on the earlier to occur of attainment of physical occupancy or one year after completion of construction

ancillary services expense decreased  or  from  to  due primarily to a decrease in development and construction expenses of offset in part by an increase in corporate rental housing expenses of the decrease in development and construction expenses is related to a decrease in services rendered as the related projects near construction completion  coupled with fewer new project starts

to qualify as a reit  we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements  including a requirement that we currently distribute at least of the reit s ordinary taxable income to shareholders 
it is our current intention to adhere to these requirements and maintain our reit status 
as a reit  we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on distributed taxable income 
we utilize gables residential services  a taxable reit subsidiary  to provide management and other services to third parties that we  as a reit  may be prohibited from providing

outstanding indebtedness for each tax exempt bond issue is reflected in the preceding table using the earlier of the related bond maturity date or the bond enhancement facility maturity date  as applicable 
our common and preferred dividends historically have been paid from cash provided by recurring real estate activities 
we anticipate that such dividends will continue to be paid from cash provided by recurring real estate activities that include both operating activities and asset disposition activities when evaluated over a twelve month period 
this twelve month evaluation period is relevant due to the timing of the payment of certain expense items that are accrued monthly but are paid on a less frequent basis  such as real estate taxes and interest on our senior unsecured notes 
we have met and expect to continue to meet our short term liquidity requirements through net cash provided by recurring real estate activities 
our net cash from recurring real estate activities has been adequate  and we believe that it will continue to be adequate  to meet both operating requirements and payment of dividends in accordance with reit requirements 
recurring value retention capital expenditures and non recurring and or value enhancing capital expenditures  in addition to monthly management s discussion and analysis amounts in thousands  except property and per share data principal amortization payments  are also expected to be funded from recurring real estate activities that include both operating and asset disposition activities 
we anticipate that acquisition  construction  development and renovation activities as well as land purchases  will be initially funded primarily through borrowings under our credit facilities described below 
we expect to meet certain of our long term liquidity requirements  such as scheduled debt maturities  repayment of short term financing of construction  development and renovation activities and possible property acquisitions  through long term secured and unsecured borrowings  the issuance of debt securities or equity securities  private equity investments in the form of joint ventures  or through the disposition of assets which  in our evaluation  may no longer meet our investment requirements 
we currently have seven communities under development that are expected to comprise  apartment homes upon completion and an indirect ownership interest in two development communities that are expected to comprise apartment homes upon completion 
the estimated costs to complete the development of these assets total million at december   including million of costs that are obligated to fund for the co investment development communities 
these costs are expected to be initially funded by million in construction loan proceeds and million in borrowings under our credit facilities described below 
million credit facility at december   we had million in borrowings outstanding under our million unsecured revolving credit facility provided by a syndicate of banks 
in february  we closed a modification to this credit facility which  among other things  increased the committed capacity thereunder to million from million 
we have the option to further increase the capacity under the facility to million from million to the extent banks from the syndicate or otherwise voluntarily agree to provide the additional commitment 
the facility currently has a maturity date of may borrowings under the million facility currently bear interest at our option of libor plus or prime minus 
such scheduled interest rates may be adjusted up or down based on changes in our senior unsecured credit ratings and our leverage ratios 
we may also enter into competitive bid loans with participating banks for up to million at rates below the scheduled rates 
in addition  we pay an annual facility fee currently equal to of the million commitment 
in february  approximately million of letters of credit enhancing approximately million of tax exempt variable rate notes payable were reissued under this facility 
million borrowing facility we have a million unsecured borrowing facility with a bank that currently has a maturity date of may the interest rate and maturity date related to each advance under this facility is agreed to by both parties prior to each advance 
we had million in borrowings outstanding under this facility at december  at an interest rate of million credit facility at december   we had million in borrowings outstanding under our million unsecured revolving credit facility provided by a bank 
the facility currently has a maturity date of december  with unlimited one year extension options 
borrowings under this facility bear interest at the same scheduled interest rates as the million credit facility 
secured variable rate construction loans we have committed fundings under four construction related financing vehicles for two wholly owned development communities totaling million from a bank 
at december   we had drawn approximately million under these vehicles and therefore have approximately million of remaining capacity 
borrowings under these vehicles bear interest at a weighted average rate of at december  restrictive covenants certain of our debt agreements contain customary representations  covenants and events of default  including covenants which restrict the ability of the operating partnership to make distributions in excess of stated amounts  which in turn restricts our ability to declare and pay dividends 
in general  during any fiscal year  the operating partnership may only distribute up to of its consolidated income available for distribution as defined in the related agreement 
the applicable debt agreements contain exceptions to these limitations to allow the operating partnership to make distributions necessary to allow us to maintain our status as a reit or distribute of our taxable income at the reit level 
we do not anticipate that this provision will adversely affect the ability of the operating partnership to make distributions or our ability to declare dividends under our current dividend policy 
management s discussion and analysis amounts in thousands  except property and per share data inflation substantially all of the leases at our apartment communities are for a term of one year or less 
in the event of significant inflation  this may enable us to realize increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or the beginning of new leases 
short term leases generally minimize our risk from the adverse effects of inflation  although these leases generally permit residents to leave at the end of the lease term without penalty and therefore expose us to the effect of a decline in market rents 
in a deflationary rent environment  as is currently being experienced in certain of our markets  we are exposed to declining rents more quickly under these shorter term leases

supplemental discussion funds from operations and adjusted funds from operations we consider funds from operations ffo to be a useful performance measure of the operating performance of an equity reit because  together with net income and cash flows  ffo provides investors with an additional basis to evaluate the ability of a reit to incur and service debt and to fund distributions and capital expenditures 
we believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results  ffo should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in the financial statements and data included elsewhere in this report 
ffo is determined in accordance with the principles established by the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit 
ffo  as defined by nareit  represents net income loss determined in accordance with gaap  excluding extraordinary items as defined under gaap and gains or losses from sales of depreciable operating property  plus certain non cash items such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
ffo presented herein is not necessarily comparable to ffo presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definition 
however  our ffo is comparable to the ffo of real estate companies that use the nareit definition 
adjusted funds from operations affo is defined as ffo less recurring value retention capital expenditures 
ffo and affo should not be considered alternatives to net income as indicators of our operating performance or as alternatives to cash flows as measures of liquidity 
ffo does not measure whether cash flow is sufficient to fund all of our cash needs  including principal amortization  capital expenditures and distributions to shareholders and unitholders 
additionally  ffo does not represent cash flows from operating  investing or financing activities as defined by gaap 
reference is made to management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources for a discussion of our cash needs and cash flows

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our capital structure includes the use of fixed rate and variable rate indebtedness 
as such  we are exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates 
we periodically seek input from third party consultants regarding market interest rate and credit risk in order to evaluate our interest rate exposure 
in certain situations  we may utilize derivative financial instruments in the form of rate caps  rate swaps or rate locks to hedge interest rate exposure by modifying the interest rate characteristics of related balance sheet instruments and prospective financing transactions 
we do not utilize such instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we did not have any derivative instruments in place at december  or we typically refinance maturing debt instruments at the then existing market interest rates and terms  which may be more or less favorable than the interest rates and terms on the maturing debt 
the following table provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates and should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
for debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates in effect at december  by expected maturity dates 
the indebtedness outstanding under each of our credit facilities is reflected in the table using the may maturity date of our million credit facility 
outstanding indebtedness for each tax exempt bond issue is reflected in the table using the earlier of the related bond maturity date or the bond enhancement facility maturity date  as applicable 
the table is presented on a pro forma basis to reflect the february reissuance of the letters of credit enhancing  of tax exempt bonds under the million credit facility with a maturity date of may the weighted average interest rates presented in this table are inclusive of credit enhancement fees 
there have been no substantial changes in our market risk profile from the preceding year and the assumptions are consistent with prior year assumptions
