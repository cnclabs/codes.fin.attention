item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies the following accounting policies and practices are those that management believes are most important to the portrayal of maytag s financial condition and results and that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
allowance for doubtful accounts maytag determines its allowance for doubtful accounts by utilizing various methodologies 
bad debt reserves are established based on an aging of accounts receivables ranging from percent of the face amount of the account receivable for current amounts up to percent for accounts in bankruptcy 
these percentages are based on historical experience 
where maytag is aware of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  it specifically reserves for the potential bad debt to reduce the receivable to the amount it reasonably believes will be collected 
if circumstances change ie  higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a customer s ability to meet its financial obligations  estimates of the recoverability of amounts due could be revised by a material amount 
pensions maytag provides noncontributory defined benefit pensions for most of its employees 
plans covering salaried  management and some nonunion hourly employees generally provide pension benefits that are based on employee s earnings and credited service 
plans covering union hourly and other nonunion hourly employees generally provide benefits of stated amounts for each year of service 
maytag s funding policy for the plans is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirement of the employee retirement income security act of erisa  plus any additional amounts that maytag may determine to be appropriate 
maytag accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
 employers accounting for pensions  which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
a minimum liability is required to be established on the consolidated balance sheets representing the amount of unfunded accrued pension cost 
the unfunded accrued pension cost is the difference between the accumulated benefit obligation and the fair value of the plan assets 
as allowed by fasb statement no 
 the company uses september as a measurement date to compute the minimum pension liability 
to account for its defined benefit plans in accordance with fasb statement no 
 maytag must make three principal assumptions as of the measurement date first  it must determine the discount rate to be used to compute the present value of the accumulated benefit obligation and projected benefit obligation for the end of the current year and to determine net periodic pension cost for the subsequent year 
for guidance in determining the discount rate  maytag looks at rates of return on high quality fixed income investments 
at december   the rate utilized was percent compared to percent and percent used for and second  maytag must determine rates of increase in compensation levels to be used in the calculation of the projected benefit obligation for the end of the current year and to determine net periodic pension cost for the subsequent year 
at december   this rate for salaried employees was percent compared to percent and percent for and at december   the rate for non union hourly employees was percent compared to percent and percent for and any changes in assumptions that affect the projected benefit obligation are deferred to unrecognized actuarial gains and losses 
the amortization of unrecognized actuarial gains and losses is recognized when the cumulative total is outside of a corridor that is defined by fasb statement no 
as the greater of percent of the projected benefit obligation or percent of the market value of plan assets 
third  as another component of net periodic pension cost  maytag must determine the expected return on plan assets 
in order to reduce volatility in the calculation of pension cost  fasb statement no 
requires the utilization of an expected rate of return on plan assets 
the difference between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return is included with other unrecognized actuarial gains and losses 
at december   maytag has reduced 
table of contents the assumption for the expected rate of return to percent for determining net periodic pension cost as compared to percent and percent for and  respectively 
the expected rate of return is based on historical rates of return over the long term 
at december   maytag s accrued pension cost was million  an increase from million at the end of the increased accrued pension cost was due to an increase in the minimum liability requirement 
the minimum liability requirement increased due to a higher accumulated benefit obligation and the lower value of plan assets at september  as compared to september  the accumulated benefit obligation increased based on one year of additional pension benefit accrual and the assumption of a lower discount rate used to calculate the liability 
the fair value of plan assets decreased by million as losses on plans assets and benefit payments exceeded employer contributions 
an additional contribution of million  subsequent to the september  measurement date  reduced the accrued pension cost on the december  consolidated balance sheet from the million amount required by the minimum liability calculation as of the september  measurement date 
net periodic pension cost increased to million in from million in the primary reason for this increase is attributable to a million curtailment charge associated with the announced closing of a manufacturing plant for further discussion see restructuring charges in this management s discussion and analysis 
net periodic pension cost also increased due to increases in service and interest cost as well as higher amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses 
maytag expects net periodic pension cost  excluding the million curtailment charge in  to increase million in to million due to a lower expected return on plan assets and a lower discount rate used to value the projected benefit obligation  partially offset by the decrease in expected rates of increase in compensation levels  as described above 
lowering the expected rate of return on plan assets by percent would have increased net periodic pension cost for by approximately million 
lowering the discount rate by percent would have increased net periodic pension cost for by approximately million 
increasing the rate of increase in compensation levels by percent would have increased net periodic pension cost for by approximately million 
pension contributions increased to million in from million in maytag has no minimum funding requirements in  based on erisa requirements 
however  the company intends to contribute million in postretirement benefits maytag provides postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for certain employee groups in the united states 
most of the postretirement plans are contributory and contain certain other cost sharing features such as deductibles and coinsurance 
the plans are unfunded 
employees do not vest and these benefits are subject to change 
death benefits for certain retired employees are funded as part of  and paid out of  pension plans 
maytag accounts for its postretirement benefits in accordance with fasb statement no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  which requires that the postretirement liability be reflected in the consolidated balance sheets and the postretirement cost be recognized in the consolidated statements of income as determined on an actuarial basis 
the company uses a september measurement date to compute the postretirement liability 
to account for postretirement benefits in accordance with fasb statement no 
 maytag must make two main assumptions at the measurement date first  it must determine the discount rate used to compute the present value of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for the end of the current year and the net periodic postretirement cost for the subsequent year 
for guidance in determining the discount rate  maytag looks at rates of return on high quality fixed income investments 
at december   maytag determined this rate to be percent compared to percent and percent used for and  respectively 
second  maytag must determine the expected health care cost trend rate used in the calculation of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for 
table of contents the end of the current year and net periodic postretirement cost for the subsequent year 
at december   due to increasing medical costs  maytag increased this initial health care cost trend rate from percent to percent 
the expected health care cost trend rate decreases gradually to percent in and thereafter 
at december   maytag s postretirement benefit liability was million  an increase from million at the end of for the year ended december   maytag incurred a net periodic postretirement cost of million  an increase from million in the increase was due in part to an million curtailment charge associated with the announced closing of a manufacturing plant for further discussion see restructuring charges in this management s discussion and analysis 
maytag currently expects that net periodic postretirement cost for  excluding the million curtailment charge in  will increase million to approximately million due to the lower discount rate used to estimate the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and an increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate  as described above 
increasing the expected health care cost trend rate one percent would have increased net periodic postretirement cost for by approximately million 
lowering the discount rate by percent would have increased net periodic postretirement cost for by approximately million 
litigation and tax contingencies maytag is a defendant in a number of legal proceedings associated with employment and product liability matters 
maytag s law department estimates the costs to settle pending litigation  including legal expenses  based on its experience involving similar cases  specific facts known  and if applicable  the judgments of outside counsel 
maytag does not believe it is a party to any legal proceedings that will likely have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations  for any particular quarterly or annual period  could be materially affected by changes in maytag s assumptions related to these proceedings 
maytag s tax returns are subject to audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities 
during the course of these audits  the authorities may question the positions taken in the return  including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income between various tax jurisdictions  which can affect the amount of taxes ultimately due 
in evaluating the exposure associated with its various filing positions  maytag records reserves for probable exposures 
to the extent maytag prevails in matters where accruals have been established or is required to pay amounts in excess of the accrual  maytag s effective tax rate and net income in a given financial period may be impacted 
accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets in  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective for fiscal years beginning after december  under the new rules  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the statement 
the statement requires a two step process for impairment testing 
the first step  used to identify potential impairment only  compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its net carrying amount on the financial statements 
fair value is determined as the amount at which the reporting unit as a whole could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties 
several estimates are required if a current market price is not available 
quoted market prices are best evidence of fair value and are used as the basis for the measurement where available 
where these are not available  fair value of the reporting unit can be estimated based on the present value of estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit 
these cash flow estimates must be based on reasonable and supportable assumptions  and consider all available evidence 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill is not considered impaired  thus the second step of the process in not necessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test shall be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
if the carrying value of goodwill on the financial statements exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill  the difference must be recognized as an impairment loss 
implied fair value of goodwill shall be determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined 

table of contents as of january  the initial impairment test and during the fourth quarter of  maytag performed step one of the impairment test of goodwill and determined that the fair value of the reporting units that have goodwill exceeded the carrying value of the net assets specifically related to these reporting units 
goodwill included in the home appliances segment totaled million as of december  most of which related to the floor care product line 
the fair value of the reporting units within this segment that have goodwill was determined using expected future discounted cash flows based on historical results 
goodwill included in the commercial appliances segment totaled million as of december  most of which related to the commercial cooking product line 
the fair value of the reporting units within this segment that have goodwill was determined using expected future discounted cash flows based on prospective assumptions as the company is undertaking additional business initiatives within this segment that are not currently reflected in the historical results 
maytag currently has no intangible assets with indefinite lives other than goodwill 
income statement reclassification maytag adopted a new accounting standard in the first quarter of that requires certain sales incentives previously recognized in selling  general and administrative expenses to be classified as a reduction of sales 
the financial accounting standards board s emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf that states any cash consideration provided to customers that has no identifiable benefit other than to increase sales is required to be classified as a reduction of sales 
this reclassification does not change previously reported operating income or net income from continuing operations  however  the reduction does impact the gross profit and operating income margins 
the amount considered as an additional reduction of sales in accordance with this accounting standard was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
prior periods have been restated to reflect this change 
comparison of with maytag has two reportable segments home appliances and commercial appliances see discussion and financial information about maytag s reportable segments in segment reporting section of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the results include the major appliances business of amana appliances amana that was acquired by maytag effective august  net sales consolidated net sales for were billion  an increase of percent from this increase was due primarily to the impact of the amana acquisition coupled with the strength of the us major appliances industry 
results reflect months of amana sales compared to only five months of sales in home appliances net sales  which include major appliances  floor care products and international export sales  increased percent compared to this increase was due to the impact of the amana acquisition  us major appliances industry strength and improved product mix 
the introduction of a hard surface floor cleaner  a new product category in this segment  also contributed to the sales growth 
us industry unit shipments of major appliances were up six percent in maytag s unit shipments of major appliances increased nine percent due primarily to the inclusion of amana product sales for a full year in compared to five months in for  maytag expects the major appliance industry to be up two to three percent compared to floor care industry shipments of uprights  the primary product type in this industry  were up two percent in maytag s unit shipments of uprights for decreased compared to as its market share declined with some of its lower priced products 
this volume loss was more than offset by volume in the new hard surface floor cleaner category  allowing total maytag floor care shipments to increase in maytag expects the floor care industry shipments of uprights to grow three percent in compared to commercial appliances net sales  which include vending equipment and commercial cooking products sales  increased six percent in compared to the increase in sales was due to improved product mix of vending equipment sales 
increases in sales of glass front venders helped to offset decreases in traditional vender sales 
maytag expects the vending equipment industry to be down five to six percent in compared to maytag expects increased average selling price in  through continued product mix improvement  to offset much of the expected industry weakness 

table of contents gross profit consolidated gross profit as a percent of sales increased to percent in from percent in the increase was due to volume leverage  improved product mix  lower material costs  gain on sale of a distribution center and favorable warranty performance 
these positive effects were partially offset by increased expenditures on research and development 
increases in the market price of steel attributable to tariffs imposed on steel imports did not affect maytag s gross profit in because of an existing domestic steel supply contract 
this contract expired at the end of and maytag expects approximately million in increased steel costs in the company expects to offset the increased steel costs with savings in other areas of sourced raw materials and components 
maytag also expects net periodic pension and postretirement costs to increase by approximately million in compared to excluding pension and postretirement curtailment costs related to restructuring charges as previously discussed in critical accounting policies in this management s discussion and analysis 
selling  general and administrative expenses consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses were percent of sales in compared to percent of sales in the decrease as a percent of sales was due to increased sales  synergies resulting from the amana acquisition  cost reduction initiatives and a change in accounting standards effective january  the accounting change eliminated the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives 
while these assets are subject to impairment tests to assess their valuation  there were no charges related to impairment during amortization of goodwill included in was million 
the reduction in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales was achieved despite a nine percent increase in advertising costs in compared to special charges during the fourth quarter of  maytag announced its intention to close a refrigeration manufacturing facility located in galesburg  illinois by the end of the company recognized a pre tax restructuring charge of million million after tax in connection with the planned closing

the financing costs associated with the maytag trusts and anvil were recognized as minority interests with the tax benefit included as a component of tax expense 
these minority interests have been retired and refinanced with borrowings for which interest expense has reduced income before tax and minority interest 
because tax expense was unaffected by the retirement of these instruments  the effective tax rate increased 
the increased rate was also due to increased income in that caused tax credits to have less of an impact on lowering the effective tax rate 
the effect of these items on the effective tax rate was partially offset by the elimination of goodwill amortization in that is nondeductible for income tax purposes 
potential federal and state legislative tax changes  coupled with the retirement of the minority interest in anvil  could result in an increase of maytag s effective tax rate for minority interest minority interest decreased by million in compared to the decrease was due to maytag s purchase of the noncontrolling interest in anvil from an outside investor in as well as the fact that the results included the maytag trusts which were not retired until the third quarter of see minority interests section in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of anvil and the maytag trusts
