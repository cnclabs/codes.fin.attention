the major currency exposure hedged by the company is the canadian dollar 
the contract amounts  carrying amounts and fair values of these contracts were not significant at january   and the changeover from national currencies to the euro began on january  and it has not materially affected and is not expected to materially affect the company s foreign currency exchange risk profile  although some customers may require the company to invoice or pay in euros rather than the functional currency of the manufacturing entity
