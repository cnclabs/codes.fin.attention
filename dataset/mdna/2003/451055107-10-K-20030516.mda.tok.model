general introduction critical accounting policies during fiscal  the company adopted certain new accounting standards issued by fasb  as described below and summarized in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements the adoption of these new accounting standards did not have a significant impact on the company s financial position or results of operations in fiscal several of the company s accounting policies involve management judgments and estimates that could be significant 
the policies with the greatest potential effect on the company s results of operations and financial position include the estimate of reserves to provide for the collectibility of accounts receivable and the recovery value of inventory 
for accounts receivable  the company estimates the net collectibility considering historical  current and anticipated trends of co op advertising deductions  operational deductions taken by customers  markdowns provided to retail customers to effectively flow goods through the retail channels  and the possibility of non collection due to the financial position of customers 
for inventory  the company estimates the amount of goods that it will not be able to sell in the normal course of business and writes down the value of these goods to the recovery value expected to be realized through price reductions and close outs 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period the company reviews all significant estimates affecting the financial statements on a recurring basis and records the effect of any adjustments when necessary 
revenue is recognized upon shipment with related risk and title passing to the customers 
estimates of losses for bad debts  returns and other allowances are recorded at the time of the sale 
distribution charges to customers and related expenses for the years ended january    and amounted to   and  respectively  are each included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which changed the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
upon the company s adoption of sfas no 
on february   the company ceased amortizing goodwill as prescribed under sfas no 
 the company had goodwill tested for impairment during fiscal  and no impairments were necessary 
impairment losses are recognized for long lived assets  including certain intangibles  used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are not sufficient to recover the assets carrying amount impairment losses are measured by comparing the fair value of the assets to their carrying amount 
other significant accounting policies are summarized in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
recent developments as a result of the company s grant of the footwear licenses  there will be a material impact on the company s net revenues  operating expenses  profits and liquidity  including interest expense 
commencing in the fiscal quarter ending july  the change in the footwear business will result in substantial reductions in net sales  net revenues and operating expenses and substantial increases in licensing income when compared to the comparable prior year s periods

the company s cash requirements and borrowings under its credit facility therefore fluctuated from time to time  due to  among other factors  seasonal requirements including the timing of receipt of merchandise 
as a result of the licensing of its footwear operations  the company will no longer need to borrow from its credit facility to finance purchases of footwear and therefore its interest expense is expected to significantly decrease 
the company s revenues will also decrease substantially  as it will no longer recognize revenues from the sale of its footwear 
the company is expecting a substantial increase in its licensing income resulting from certain guaranteed payments under the company s footwear licenses 
in addition  the company is expecting to eliminate a substantial portion of its operating expenses  resulting primarily from the elimination of operations relating to the former design  development  importing  distribution and sale of footwear 
the company is also planning on closing its offices in valhalla  new york  and a floor of its offices in new york city and consolidating to approximately  square feet in new york city 
the company will remain obligated on the valhalla lease through may  subject to its ability to sublet the space 
due to the anticipated decreases in operating expenses and increases in licensing income  the company is projecting that its change from a manufacturer distributor of footwear to a licensor of footwear manufacturing and distribution rights will result in an increase in net profits after giving effect to certain charges relating to the transition from manufacturing and distributing footwear products to licensing such rights and the expected closing of certain retail stores

seasonality the company s quarterly results may fluctuate quarter to quarter as a result of holidays  weather  the timing of product shipments  market acceptance of company products  the mix  pricing and presentation of the products offered and sold  the hiring and training of personnel  the timing of inventory write downs  fluctuations in the cost of materials  the mix between wholesale and licensing businesses  and the incurrence of operating costs beyond the company s control as may be caused general economic conditions  and other unpredictable factors such as the action of competitors 
accordingly  the results of operations in any quarter will not necessarily be indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year or any future quarter 
in addition  the timing of the receipt of future revenues could be impacted by the recent trend among retailers in the company s industry to order goods closer to a particular selling season than they have historically done so 
the company continues to seek to expand and diversify its product lines to help reduce the dependence on any particular product line and lessen the impact of the seasonal nature of its business 
the success of the company  however  will still largely remain dependent on its ability to predict accurately upcoming fashion trends among its customer base  build and maintain brand awareness and to fulfill the product requirements of its retail channel within the shortened timeframe required 
unanticipated changes in consumer fashion preferences  slowdowns in the united states economy  changes in the prices of supplies  consolidation of retail establishments  among other factors noted herein  could adversely affect the company s future operating results 
the company s products are marketed primarily for fall and spring seasons  with slightly higher volumes of products sold during the second quarter 
effects of inflation the company does not believe that the relatively moderate rates of inflation experienced over the past few years in the united states  where it primarily competes  have had a significant effect on revenues or profitability
