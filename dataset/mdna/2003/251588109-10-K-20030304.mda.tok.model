forward looking statements the private securities litigation reform act of the reform act provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the corporation 
the corporation and its representatives may  from time to time  make written or verbal forward looking statements  including statements contained in the corporation s filings with the securities and exchange commission and in its reports to stockholders 
generally  the inclusion of the words believe  expect  intend  estimate  anticipate  will  and similar expressions identify statements that constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of and that are intended to come within the safe harbor protection provided by those sections 
all statements addressing operating performance  events  or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future  including statements relating to sales growth  earnings or earnings per share growth  and market share  as well as statements expressing optimism or pessimism about future operating results  are forward looking statements within the meaning of the reform act 
the forward looking statements are and will be based upon our management s then current views and assumptions regarding future events and operating performance  and are applicable only as of the dates of such statements 
we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events  or otherwise 
by their nature  all forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results  including our revenues from both are construction and materials divisions  expenses  gross margins  cash flows  financial condition  and net income  as well as factors such as our competitive position  inventory levels  backlog  the demand for our products and services  customer base and the liquidity and needs of our customers  may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward looking statements or those currently being experienced by the company for a number of reasons  including but not limited to o the strength of the construction economies on various islands in the caribbean  primarily in the united states virgin islands  st maarten  st 
martin  antigua and puerto rico 
our business is subject to economic conditions in our markets  including recession  inflation  deflation  general weakness in construction and housing markets  and changes in infrastructure requirements 
o our ability to maintain mutually beneficial relationships with key customers 
we have a number of significant customers 
the loss of significant customers  the financial condition of our customers or an adverse change to the financial condition of our significant customers could have a material adverse effect on our business or the collectibility of our receivables 
o unforeseen inventory adjustments or significant changes in purchasing patterns by our customers and the resultant impact on manufacturing volumes and inventory levels 
o adverse changes in currency exchange rates or raw material commodity prices  both in absolute terms and relative to competitors risk profiles 
we have businesses in various foreign countries in the caribbean 
as a result  we are exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the united states dollar 
we believe our most significant foreign currency exposure is the euro 
o increased competition 
the materials division operates in markets  which are highly competitive on the basis of price and quality 
we compete with local suppliers of ready mix  and foreign suppliers of aggregates and concrete block 
competition from certain of these manufacturers has intensified in recent years and is expected to continue 
the construction division has local and foreign competitors in its markets 
customer and competitive pressures sometimes have an adverse effect on our pricing 
o our foreign operations may be affected by factors such as tariffs  nationalization  exchange controls  interest rate fluctuations  civil unrest  governmental changes  limitations on foreign investment in local business and other political  economic and regulatory conditions  risks or difficulties 
o the effects of litigation  environmental remediation matters  and product liability exposures  as well as other risks and uncertainties detailed from time to time in our filings with the securities and exchange commission 
o our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to support capital expansion  business acquisition plans  our share repurchase program and general operating activities  and our ability to obtain necessary financing at favorable interest rates 
o changes in laws and regulations  including changes in accounting standards  taxation requirements  including tax rate changes  new tax laws and revised tax law interpretations  and environmental laws  in both domestic and foreign jurisdictions  and restrictions on repatriation of foreign investments 
o the impact of unforeseen events  including war or terrorist activities  on economic conditions and consumer confidence 
o interest rate fluctuations and other capital market conditions 
o construction contracts with a fixed price sometimes suffer penalties that cannot be recovered by additional billing  which penalties may be due to circumstances in completing construction work  errors in bidding contracts  or changed conditions 
o adverse weather conditions  specifically heavy rains or hurricanes  which could reduce demand for our products 
the foregoing list is not exhaustive 
there can be no assurance that we have correctly identified and appropriately assessed all factors affecting our business or that the publicly available and other information with respect to these matters is complete and correct 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial also may adversely impact us 
should any risks and uncertainties develop into actual events  these developments could have material adverse effects on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
for these reasons  you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on our forward looking statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion of our financial condition and results of operations is an analysis of the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  consistently applied 
although our significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statement  the following discussion is intended to describe those accounting policies and estimates most critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to allowance for credit losses  valuation of the antigua and barbuda notes  inventories and loss reserve for inventories  cost to complete of construction contracts  assets held for sale  intangible assets  income taxes  specifically the antigua tax assessments  tax on un repatriated earnings  warranty obligations  restructuring  business divestitures  pensions  deferral compensation and other employee benefit plans or arrangements  environmental matters  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable  the results of which  form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements o revenue and earnings on construction contracts  including construction joint ventures are recognized on the percentage of completion method based upon the ratio of costs incurred to estimated final costs  for which collectibility is reasonably assured 
provisions are recognized in the statement of income for the full amount of estimated losses on uncompleted contracts whenever evidence indicates that the estimated total cost of a contract exceeds its estimated total revenue 
contract cost is recorded as incurred and revisions in contract revenue and cost estimates are reflected in the accounting period when known 
revenue in an amount equal to cost incurred is recognized prior to contracts reaching completion 
change orders for additional contract revenue are recognized if it is probable that they will result in additional revenue and the amount can be reliably estimated 
the related earnings are not recognized until the period in which such percentage completion is attained 
it is our judgment that until a project reaches completion  there is insufficient information to determine with a reasonable level of assurance what the estimated profit on the project will be 
we estimate costs to complete our construction contracts based on experience from similar work in the past 
if the conditions of the work to be performed changes or if the estimated costs are not accurately projected  the gross profit from construction contracts may vary significantly in the future 
the foregoing  as well as weather  stage of completion and mix of contracts at different margins may cause fluctuations in gross profit between periods and these fluctuations may be significant 
o we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from management s review and assessment of our customers ability to make required payments 
we consider the age of specific accounts  a customer s payment history and specific collateral given by the customer to secure the receivable 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required 
if the customers pay a previous impaired receivable  income is then recognized 
o we maintain reserves for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory for the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assessments about current and future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions were to be less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory reserves could be required 
if the actual market demand surpasses the projected levels  certain inventory reserves would be removed and the result of operations would be higher than expected 
o we maintain an accrual for deferred compensation agreements with the company s president and certain other employees 
this accrual is based on the life expectancy of these persons and the assumed company specific long term interest rate for debt  percent 
should the actual longevity vary significantly from the united states insurance norms  or should the interest rate used to establish the present value of the deferred compensation obligation vary  the accrual may have to be significantly increased or diminished at that time 
o based on written legal opinion from antiguan counsel  we have not recorded a liability of million  not including any interest or penalties  for taxes assessed by the government of antigua and barbuda for the years through the government may also assess further taxes for the years prior and subsequent to the assessed tax years 
we are appealing said assessments 
however  if our appeal is not successful  a significant tax liability may have to be recorded 
we do not believe losing the appeal would have an immediate effect on our cash flow  as the government of antigua and barbuda owes us in excess of million  and we have the right of to offset against any amounts owed the government 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
o we have million of un repatriated earnings in our foreign subsidiaries 
we have no intention of bringing these earnings back to the united states  unless we can do so in a tax free manner 
however  should we be forced to repatriate the earnings  we would have to recognize and pay a substantial us federal income tax 
the tax would be approximately percent of the repatriated amount  or potentially million 
o we were accounting for the notes receivable from the government of antigua and barbuda under the cost recovery method until april subsequent to a restructuring of the notes  we started to account for the notes using the accrual method 
we record payments received  first to the projected principal reductions for the period  then to accrued interest  and lastly to additional reduction of principal 
interest income is recognized on the notes only to the extent payments are recorded for accrued interest 
should the payments from the government diminish substantially or become uncertain  we may have to revert to the cost recovery method or impair the notes 
this could decrease our earnings significantly 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the government was delayed in certain of its payments due in the fourth quarter of and  consequently  the company recorded  less in interest income compared to the average of the first three quarters of subsequent to year end the company received payment for all past due amounts from o we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event that we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
we are not presently considering changes to any of our critical accounting policies and we do not presently believe that any of our critical accounting policies are reasonably likely to change in the near future 
there have not been any material changes to the methodology used in calculating our estimates during the last three years  except for the company starting to recognize interest income for payments received from the government of antigua and barbuda in april  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the ceo  cfo and the audit committee have reviewed all of the foregoing critical accounting policies and estimates 
comparison of year ended december  with year ended december  total revenue our revenue was million in and million in this percent decrease reflects a decrease in materials revenue  partially offset by an increase in construction revenue 
our materials revenue decreased percent to million in from million in this decrease was primarily due to reduction in sale of concrete  block and aggregates  and reduced sale of cement due to the termination of our cement distribution agreement with union maritima international  sa on march  concrete and block revenue diminished and  respectively  mainly due to the completion in early of a large construction project on st 
croix and reduced volumes on st 
martin  offset to a lesser extent by improved volumes on antigua 
aggregates revenue was reduced by  mainly due to reduced activity on puerto rico  offset to a lesser extent by improved volumes on antigua 
we believe the poor result on st 
maarten st 
martin is a result of a slowdown in the island s economy due to reduced tourism on that island in the aftermath of the events of september  however  we have seen continued strengthening demand in the us virgin islands and antigua over the last year 
at this time we cannot predict materials revenue levels in revenue from our construction division increased percent to million in from million in this increase resulted primarily from increased activity in the bahamas and the us virgin islands 
our backlog of unfilled portions of land development contracts at december  was approximately million involving projects  as compared to approximately million involving projects at december  the backlogs of the contracts on exuma in the bahamas at december  were approximately million 
since december   through february   we have entered into new construction contracts in the caribbean amounting to approximately million  and we are finalizing contracts for another million that we estimate will be signed shortly  however  no assurance can be given that these contracts will be signed as expected 
we are actively bidding and negotiating additional projects 
we expect most of the current backlog to be completed during cost of materials cost of materials increased slightly to percent of materials revenue from percent in this increase was primarily the result of a decrease in revenue  which resulted in fixed costs of sales weighing heavier on the margins for the division  and reduced margins in st 
martin 
cost of construction cost of construction increased to percent of construction revenue in from percent in this increase is primarily attributable to the marine equipment having profitable work in and being idle in  the cost of which includes depreciation and continuous maintenance of the equipment  and also to the varying profitability levels of individual contracts and the stage of completion of such contracts 
operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses sg a expense increased by percent to million in from million in the increase in sg a expense was primarily due to retirement and severance expense and losses on foreign exchange 
as a percentage of revenue  sg a expense increased to percent during as compared to percent during the previous year 
due to lower profitability and lower volumes affecting certain assets  management upon its review in and of long lived assets  determined that impairment had occurred to some of our assets 
an impairment expense of  was recognized in compared to  in operating loss income we had an operating loss of million in compared to income of  in our materials division had an operating loss of  in  compared to  in this increased operating loss is mainly due to the operations on st 
maarten st 
martin  offset to a lesser extent by improved results on other islands  in particular antigua and st 
thomas 
the operations in st 
maarten st 
martin were affected by lower volumes  increased costs in terms of severance expenses and loss on foreign exchange 
although there is no assurance  we believe that the operations in st 
maarten st 
martin will improve during  due to earlier lay offs of personnel and projected improved volumes 
however  the operations may not reach a break even level in the near future 
we see some continuing strength in st thomas and antigua  but do not presently anticipate significant changes in puerto rico and st 
croix 
our construction division had an operating loss of million in compared to income of million in this decrease was primarily attributable to the marine division s having profitable work in and being idle in  also we had lower margins on some contracts during the current backlog is comparatively low  therefore  unless we can achieve success in our current negotiations and bids for new contracts  we may see continuing poor results for the division in other income at the time of the sale of the operations in dominica in  the company entered into a profit and loss participation agreement that expired on march  during this time the gain on the sale of the operations was deferred 
at march   the company recognized a gain on sale of business of million 
gain on sale of equipment was  in  compared to  for the previous year 
our interest expense decreased to  in from  in due to a reduction of outstanding debt and reduced interest rates 
our interest income of million remained approximately the same in compared to the previous year  interest recognized on notes receivable due from the government of antigua and barbuda increased in  while interest received on outstanding accounts receivable diminished 
the minority interest allocation of losses decreased to in from  in  mainly because the losses in puerto rico cannot be allocated to the joint venture partners  as their equity has been exhausted 
income taxes income taxes decreased to  in from  in our tax rate varies depending on the level of our earnings in the various tax jurisdictions where we operate  the tax loss carry forwards and tax exemptions available to us 
the effective tax rate was percent in as compared to percent in the company is currently appealing tax assessments in antigua for million  as has been previously discussed 
see also item and notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
net income our net income was million in compared to million in this reduction in profitability was primarily attributable to our operating loss of million  partially offset by a gain on sale of business of million  improvement of the net interest income expense from million in to million in and a decrease of income taxes 
comparison of year ended december  with year ended december  total revenue our revenue was million in and million in this percent decrease reflects a decrease in materials revenue  partially offset by an increase in construction revenue 
our materials revenue decreased percent to million in from million in this decrease was primarily due to the sale of our cement terminals in the caribbean and the sale of our operations in dominica in and to the termination of a cement distribution agreement in march excluding these operations  materials revenue decreased by percent  primarily due to decreased demand for block and concrete in st 
martin and antigua 
we have  during the fourth quarter of  seen significantly diminished demand in our st 
martin and antigua operations 
we believe this is a result of a slowdown in the islands economy due to reduced tourism in those islands in the aftermath of the events of september  however  we have seen continued strengthening demand in the us virgin islands over the last year 
revenue from our construction division increased percent to million in from million in this increase resulted primarily from increased activity with our dredge in st 
martin  partially offset by lower activity in the us virgin islands and antigua 
our backlog of unfilled portions of land development contracts at december  was approximately million involving projects  as compared to approximately million involving projects at december  the backlogs of the contracts in the bahamas at december  was approximately million 
cost of materials cost of materials decreased slightly to percent of materials revenue from percent in the cost decrease was due to the reduction of sales of cement that had a lower margin than the rest of our business 
the cost of materials for the materials division  excluding cement  decreased to percent in as compared to percent in cost of construction cost of construction increased to percent of construction revenue in from percent in increased costs as a percent of revenue were due to lower profitability on some contracts 
our gross margins are also affected by the profitability of each contract and the stage of completion 
operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses sg a expense decreased by percent to million in from million in this decrease is primarily due a reduction in impairment expense  bad debt expense  labor cost  fees and other taxes 
due to lower profitability  lower volumes and hurricane damages affecting certain assets  management  upon its review in and of long lived assets  determined that impairment had occurred to some of our assets 
an impairment expense of  was recognized in compared to  in in  the remaining goodwill recorded in connection with the purchase of our subsidiary in st 
martin was impaired by  due to projected low profitability 
in addition  in the remaining assets in saba were determined to be impaired due to the closure of its operations  and certain obsolete equipment was also determined to be impaired 
operating loss income operating income was  in compared to a loss of million in our materials division had operating income of  in  compared to a loss of million in this improvement is primarily due to improved profitability in most islands relating primarily to reduced cost of production as well as reduced sg a expenses 
over the last two years we have seen an improvement in the operating income of the materials division 
however  there are risks that this trend cannot be sustained and that the division s results may decrease in the near future 
our construction division had operating income of million in compared to million in this is primarily attributable to lower margins on some contracts 
due to possible lower activity in  we may see reduced earnings  however  the remaining backlog is estimated to have reasonable gross profit margins 
other income in  we recognized a gain on the sale of our cement terminals and the concrete business in st 
thomas and the tortola operation  in the aggregate amount of million 
we had gains on sale of other property and equipment of  in compared to  in our interest expense decreased to  in from  in due to a substantial reduction of outstanding debt  utilizing the proceeds of our sales of operations as mentioned above 
our interest income increased to million in compared to million in our interest income increased due to interest recognized on notes receivable due from the government of antigua and barbuda  and to interest received on outstanding accounts and notes receivable 
the minority interest allocation of losses decreased to  in from  in  mainly because the losses in puerto rico cannot be allocated to the joint venture partners as their equity has been exhausted 
income taxes income taxes increased to  in from  in our tax rate varies depending on the level of our earnings in the various tax jurisdictions where we operate  the tax loss carry forwards and tax exemptions available to us 
the effective tax rate was percent in as compared to percent in see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
net income our net income was million in compared to a net income of million in this reduction in profitability was primarily attributable to the million profit recognized on the sales of assets in the beginning of year  partially offset by a net interest income increase from million in to million in  and a reduction of our operating loss by million 
liquidity and capital resources we generally fund our working capital needs from operations and bank borrowings 
in the construction business  we expend considerable funds for equipment  labor and supplies 
our capital needs are greatest at the start of a new contract  since we generally must complete to days of work before receiving the first progress payment 
as a project continues  a portion of the progress billing is usually withheld as retainage until the work is complete 
we sometimes provide long term financing to customers who have previously utilized our construction services 
during  we financed million  and the outstanding balance of the financed construction contracts as of december  was million  all of which is due to be paid at different times within the next three years 
accounts receivable for the materials division are typically outstanding for days or longer 
our business requires a continuing investment in plant and equipment  along with the related maintenance and upkeep costs 
management believes our cash flow from operations  existing working capital  and funds available from lines of credit are adequate to meet our needs during the next months 
historically  we have used a number of lenders to finance a portion of our machinery and equipment purchases 
at december   there were no amounts outstanding to these lenders 
management believes it has significant collateral and financial stability to be able to obtain significant financing  should it be required  though no assurances can be made 
as of december   our liquidity and capital resources included cash and cash equivalents of million  working capital of million and available lines of credit of million 
total outstanding liabilities were million as of december  compared to million a year earlier 
cash flow provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million compared with million for the year ended december  the primary use of cash for operating activities during the year ended december  was an increase in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings of million  an increase in inventories of  and a decrease in billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings 
the primary source of cash from operating activities was an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of  a decrease in receivables of  and an increase in deferred gain and other non current liabilities of  net cash used in investing activities was million in  including purchases of property  plant  and equipment of million  offset by payments received on notes of million 
net cash used in financing activities was million  including purchases of treasury stock of  and principal payments on indebtness of  our accounts receivable averaged days of sales outstanding as of december  this is an improvement from days at the end of december the company s materials division improved to days as compared to days at the end of the previous year 
the improvements were particularly noticeable in antigua  of which a part is due to large payments from one customer  in particular 
we have seen smaller improvements in st thomas  puerto rico and st maarten  but have also seen deterioration in st 
martin 
the construction division has improved substantially to days as compared to days at the end of last year 
the improvement was due to large cash receipts from the venture in the bahamas in the beginning of the year 
we do not consider notes receivable in this calculation 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we have a million unsecured overdraft facility from a commercial bank in the united states 
the facility is due on demand and bears interest at a rate variable with libor 
the bank can demand repayment of the loan and cancellation of the overdraft facility  if certain financial or other covenants are in default 
at december   we had  outstanding under this line 
this facility was put in place to help cash management strategies 
we have similar overdraft facilities with caribbean banks totaling  at december   we had no outstanding amounts on these facilities 
at december  we had borrowed million from the company s president 
the note to the president is unsecured and bears interest at the prime rate 
presently   is due on demand and million is due on july  the president has the option to make the note due on demand should a change of control occur 
a change of control is deemed to have occurred if a person or group acquires percent or more of the common stock or announces a tender offer that  if successful  would result in ownership by a person or group of percent or more of the common stock 
we purchase equipment as needed for our ongoing business operations 
we are currently replacing or upgrading some equipment used by the materials division  principally concrete trucks and quarry equipment 
this resulted in a net cash expenditure of million in at present  management believes that our inventory of construction equipment is adequate for our current contractual commitments and operating activities 
new construction contracts may  depending on the nature of the contract and job location and duration  require us to make significant investments in heavy construction equipment 
the company has identified certain idle equipment in the material division and is currently trying to sell this equipment 
during we sold equipment with an original cost basis of million and a net book value of  the net proceeds consisting of cash and notes receivable were  we realized a gain of approximately  on these transactions 
we believe we have available funds or can obtain sufficient financing for our contemplated equipment replacements and additions 
in september  the company decided to stop its operations on aguadilla  puerto rico 
there was no material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
the company has leased  with option to buy  its equipment on this site to a company controlled by one of the joint venture owners of the company s subsidiary in puerto rico 
the lease rate should generate a small income after depreciation and interest on the equipment 
our notes receivable at december  include million in promissory notes from the government of antigua  with approximately  classified as a current receivable 
see notes  and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
our only issued guarantee is more fully described below under contingent liabilities and our short term borrowings  long term debt  other long term obligations and lease commitments are more fully described in notes   and  respectively  of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations by due date payment due by period to to total and beyond short term borrowings   long term debt     capital leases    operating leases      purchase obligations other non current liabilities     total      as part of the  subsequently renegotiated in  acquisition of societe des carrieres de grand case scgc  a french company operating a ready mix concrete plant and quarry in st 
martin  the company agreed to pay the quarry owners  who were also the owners of scgc  a royalty payment of  per year through july and rent of  per year through july the agreements may be renewed  at the company s option  for a successive five year period and would require annual payments of  and  per year  respectively 
at the end of the year royalty period  the company has the option to purchase this hectare property for million 
we have not guaranteed any other person s or company s debt  except as set forth below in contingent liabilities 
we have not entered into any currency or interest options  swaps or future contracts  nor do we have any off balance sheet debts or transactions  except as disclosed below under contingent liabilities 
we are sometime involved in litigation  the outcome of such litigation may in the future have an impact on our liquidity 
see item above 
contingent liabilities during the second quarter  the company issued a construction contract performance guarantee together with one of the company s customers  northshore partners  inc  northshore  in favor of estate plessen associates lp and jpmorgan chase bank  for million 
northshore partners is an important customer on st 
croix and the construction contract that northshore partners has with estate plessen associate lp has requirements for our construction materials 
although there is no assurance  we do not presently believe that this guarantee will have any material impact on our liquidity or capital resources or any material negative impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in the case that northshore is unable to fulfill its commitments of the construction contract  the company will be obligated to take northshore s place and finish the contract 
the company is closely monitoring the progress of construction 
the company issued a letter of credit for  as collateral for the transaction and has not yet had any expenses in connection with this transaction 
the construction project is estimated to be finished within two years and the guarantee expires two years after completion 
the company received an up front fee of  and has recognized a receivable for additional  at the same time  a long term liability of the total amount has been recorded  which may be recognized to income  once it is determined that no liability exists for the project  less any amounts paid by us in connection with the performance guarantee 
we have no other off balance sheet transactions where we are the obligors 
details regarding the company s other contingent liabilities are described fully in note of notes to the consolidated statements 
related party transactions we have engaged in transactions with some of our directors or employees 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements and item of part iii we lease from the company president  mr 
donald l 
smith  jr 
a acre parcel of real property in deerfield beach  florida of which a smaller portion is actually utilized by the company 
this property is being used for our equipment logistics and maintenance activities 
the annual rent for the period through was  which was below market rent for the utilized portion of the property 
in january  a new year agreement was signed  the rent was increased to  this rent was based on comparable rental contracts for similar properties in deerfield beach 
we have borrowed million from mr 
smith  our president  to provide long term financing to the company and security for a payment guarantee issued by mr 
smith on behalf of an entity in the bahamas 
the loan is documented with an unsecured note  of which  is payable on demand and million is due on july  the interest charged by mr 
smith is at the prime rate 
we believe that these terms are similar to what the company would be able to achieve if we were to borrow this money from a bank 
our board approved this transaction in advance 
see liquidity and capital resources above 
we have a million construction contract with an entity in the bahamas 
mr 
smith and mr 
steele  a director of our company  are minority shareholders in the entity  percent and percent  respectively 
mr 
smith is also a member of the entity s managing committee 
we believe the contract has been entered into at arm s length and at terms and conditions that we would offer our other customers 
prices established for the work are dependent on market conditions and unique conditions to the environment of the bahamas 
in connection with this contract  the company recorded revenue of million during the backlog on the contract as of december  was million 
as of december  we had trade receivables from the venture of approximately million and the cost and estimated earnings in excess of billings was million 
mr 
smith has guaranteed the payment of the receivables from the entity  up to a maximum of million 
our joint venture subsidiary in puerto rico has transactions with the joint venture partners 
a company controlled by one of the partners provides drilling and blasting services for our quarry in guaynabo 
the price for the services is negotiated periodically  primarily by comparison to the cost of performing that work by us 
the subsidiary recently entered into a month lease agreement for equipment located in the aguadilla facility with another company controlled by this partner 
the agreement also contains an option to buy the equipment 
the price of the lease and the sales price of the equipment were negotiated between the parties at arm s length 
there are no clear comparable prices in the market place  and no third party evaluation of the fairness of the transaction was completed 
the subsidiary will recuperate its recorded book value of the assets  should the purchase option be exercised 
the same subsidiary sells a significant portion of its products to a company controlled by another joint venture partner 
in our subsidiary s revenue from these sales was  this partner is controlled by one of our directors  jose a 
bechara  jr 
esq 
the price of the products is governed by firm supply agreements  renegotiated every other year 
comparable prices from other quarries are studied and used in the price negotiation 
other assets include amounts due from officers and employees as a result of payments made by the company pursuant to a split dollar life insurance plan 
our advances to pay premiums are secured by a pledge of the cash value of the issued policies 
amounts due to the company under the split dollar life insurance plan were  in and  in  respectively 
no payments were made since july on these policies and no commitments exist to make any further payments on the policies 
the board has adopted a policy that all future related party transactions be approved by a majority of disinterested directors in advance 
we believe that all of the foregoing related party transactions were entered into on an arms length basis 
new accounting standards in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas 
sfas requires the company to record the fair value of an asset retirement obligation as a liability in the period in which it incurs a legal obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development  and or normal use of the assets 
the company also records a corresponding asset that is depreciated over the life of the asset 
subsequent to the initial measurement of the asset retirement obligation  the obligation will be adjusted at the end of each period to reflect the passage of time and changes in the estimated future cash flows underlying the obligation 
the company is required to adopt sfas on january  the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial position and results of operations 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no
