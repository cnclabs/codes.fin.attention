item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the three years ended december    and results of operations overview we provide services and products primarily focused on the repair and healing of the musculoskeletal system 
based on our knowledge of the allograft bone tissue industry  we believe that we are the world s largest processor and developer of human bone and bone connective tissue 
the allograft bone tissue we process is procured by independent tissue banks and other tissue recovery organizations  or tro s  primarily through the donation of tissue from deceased human donors and is used for transplantation 
we process allograft bone tissue for our clients from allograft bone tissue provided by them  and also for us from allograft bone tissue recovered by tro s for us in both our grafton r dbm segment and base tissue segment 
we provide services and technology associated with making human tissue safe for transplantation 
we also develop and process tissue forms for use in a variety of surgical procedures 
while we perform the medical education to teach surgeons about the uses of these tissue forms  prior to these tissue forms were generally distributed to hospitals and surgeons by our tissue bank clients 
commencing in the first half of  and expanding throughout the remainder of and throughout  we began to distribute tissue forms directly to hospitals and surgeons 
we expect to continue to expand our direct distribution efforts in and beyond 
as a result  we expect that revenues from direct distribution of tissue will continue to grow over the next several years 
in turn  we expect that as revenues grow from this distribution strategy  we expect to experience a positive impact on gross profit margins and operating income because although we will incur recovery costs in connection with tissue we distribute directly  we will not share a portion of the invoice price on these tissue forms with our tissue bank clients as we do with the tissue that we process for them  but they distribute 
for the years ended december  and  and  respectively  of our consolidated revenues were generated from processing tissue that our tissue bank clients distributed 
this change in distribution methodology has impacted our liquidity and cash flow 
we have had to make additional investments in inventories and deferred processing costs to support our direct distribution efforts  and expect to make additional investments in inventory and deferred processing costs  as necessary  to support our efforts to expand direct distribution 
as a greater percentage of our revenues are generated from direct shipments to hospitals and surgeons  which typically pay invoices slower than our historical tissue bank customer base  we expect that our days sales in accounts receivable will increase slightly 
exclusive of the funds we raised in the sale of million shares of common stock in the second quarter of  which generated net proceeds of  in and we experienced a decrease in available cash  cash equivalents and short term investments due to our continued investments in our business and from operating losses incurred in and see liquidity and capital resources and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we expect to continue to make investments in our business to support our direct distribution efforts and future programs and initiatives  which may further deplete our available cash balances 
we believe that our available cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  available lines of credit and anticipated future cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our forecasted cash needs in however  we may seek additional funding to meet the needs of our long term strategic plan 
there can be no assurance that such additional funds will be available  or if available  that such funds will be available on favorable terms 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that effect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and may adjust them based upon the latest information available to us 
these estimates generally include those related to product returns  bad debts  inventories including purchase commitments  deferred processing costs including rework reserves  intangible assets  income taxes and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
o we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts  primarily for our direct distribution accounts  for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
o we record reductions to revenue for estimated product and allograft bone tissue form returns based upon historical experience 
if future returns are less than our historical experience  a reduction in estimated reserves would increase revenue 
alternatively  should returns exceed historical experience  additional allowances would be required  which would reduce revenue 
o we write down inventory and deferred processing costs for estimated excess  obsolescence or unmarketable products and allograft bone tissue forms equal to the difference between cost and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
excess and obsolescence could occur from numerous factors  including  but not limited to  the competitive nature of the market  technological change and changes in surgeon preference 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional write downs may be required 
in addition  we provide reserves  if any  for the difference between our contractual purchase commitments and our projected purchasing patterns based upon the maintenance of adequate inventory levels and forecasted revenues 
if actual revenue is less favorable than those forecasted by management  additional reserves may be required  alternatively  if revenue is stronger than forecasted by management  such reserves would be reduced 
o we depreciate amortize our property  plant and equipment based upon our estimate of the respective asset s useful life 
in addition  we evaluate impairments of our property  plant and equipment based upon an analysis of estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
if the company determines that a change is required in the useful life of an asset  future depreciation amortization is adjusted accordingly 
alternatively  should we determine that an asset has been impaired  an adjustment would be charged to income based on its fair market value  or discounted cash flows if the fair market value is not readily determinable  reducing income in that period 
o we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
o we accrue current and future tax liabilities based upon levels of taxable income  tax planning strategies and assessments of the timing of taxability of tax attributes 
while we have considered current tax laws in establishing our tax liabilities  in the event we were to settle our tax liabilities for less than amounts accrued we would increase income in the period such determination was made 
should we determine it would cost us more to settle our tax liabilities  an adjustment would be charged to income thus reducing income in that period 
o litigation is subject to many uncertainties and management is unable to predict the outcome of the pending suits or claims 
when we are reasonably able to determine the probable minimum or ultimate liability  if any  that may result from any of the pending litigation  we will record a provision for such liability  and if appropriate  will reduce such liability to the extent covered by insurance 
if the outcome or resolution of the pending suit or claim is for amounts greater than we have accrued  an adjustment will be charged to income in the period the determination is made 
alternatively  should the suit or claim be for less than we have accrued  we would increase income in the period the determination is made 
temporary suspension of base tissue segment processing on september   we voluntarily and temporarily suspended base tissue segment processing due to higher than normal incidence of sterility failures on finished forms of processed allograft bone tissue  which occurred in our eatontown facility  and subsequently  in our shrewsbury facility 
in addition  as a precaution  we also initiated a voluntary retrieval of certain tissue from whole donors and five individual pieces of tissue from five different donors that had previously been shipped to clients although all such tissue was tested and found sterile 
in october   we restarted base tissue segment processing in our shrewsbury facility  and in november  we restarted base tissue segment processing in our eatontown facility 
as a result of the temporary suspension of base tissue segment processing  we placed tissue processed in third quarter from donors in quarantine 
we expect to rework and or release all quarantined tissue in we will invoice our clients and or our customers for this tissue when it is shipped 
we have estimated that the cost to rework this tissue is  in order to successfully rework this tissue  we will need to meet certain technical  scientific and regulatory requirements 
we believe that we will be able to meet such requirements  however  there can be no certainty that we will be able to meet all such requirements or be able to rework this tissue for our estimated cost 
these events have negatively impacted our operating results 
we have estimated that third quarter base tissue segment revenues were negatively impacted by approximately  and gross profit was impacted by the lost revenues and by the  estimated cost to rework the tissue in quarantine 
we have estimated that fourth quarter base tissue segment revenues were negatively impacted by approximately  while gross profit was impacted by the lost revenues and the effects of negative production variances  which we estimate were approximately  income loss from continuing operations we incurred a consolidated loss from continuing operations in of  or 
diluted loss per share compared to a consolidated loss from continuing operations of  or 
diluted loss per share in and consolidated income from continuing operations of  or 
diluted income per share in the loss from continuing operations included after tax charges of  for the estimated cost to rework the tissue from donors placed in quarantine in the third quarter of  a reserve of  for the penalty associated with metal spinal implants  primarily affirm tm  that we do not expect to purchase  which are subject to purchase commitments   for excess and obsolete inventory related to spinal implant systems  including the bio d r threaded cortical bone dowel  which we removed from the market on january  in connection with the lawsuit settlement with medtronic  inc  and  associated with payment to medtronic in connection with the litigation settlement  partially offset by the recognition of an income tax benefit of  related to liabilities for tax benefits recorded in that are no longer required and an after tax gain of  related to the sale of the polyactive tm polymer biomaterial technology and patents to isotis bv 
the loss from continuing operations in includes after tax charges of  related to provisions for excess inventory and instrument sets for spinal implant systems   for equipment which is no longer utilized in the processing of allograft tissue  and  primarily for severance costs associated with the departure of an executive officer 
income from continuing operations in included an after tax gain of  related to the patent litigation settlement with depuy acromed  inc depuy 
the consolidated loss from continuing operations before income taxes was  in and  in compared to income from continuing operations before taxes of  in discontinued operations on july   effective june   we completed the sale of the business and substantially all of the assets  including the assumption of certain liabilities  of our operations in leiden  the netherlands for  in cash and a non interest bearing note with a face value of  which we discounted based on the acquirer s incremental borrowing rate of 
these operations represented our ceramic and titanium plasma spray coating services and products 
we recognized a loss on the sale of this business of  in the second quarter of revenues from this business were  in through the date of sale and were  and  in and  respectively

the following is a discussion of factors affecting results of operations for the years ended december    and after giving effect to the divestiture of the operations of our subsidiary in the netherlands 
net revenues consolidated net revenues increased in to  compared to consolidated revenues of  in the increase in was principally due to higher revenues in all segments mainly as a result of increased volume  and to a lesser extent by price increases effective january  this increase was achieved even though revenues were constrained by the temporary suspension of base tissue segment processing operations and from placing tissue in quarantine that otherwise would have been released and invoiced to our clients  and by the suspension of sales of affirm tm 
domestic net revenues increased in to  from  in the increase in domestic revenues was due primarily to increased unit volume in grafton r dbm  bio implants and spinal metal implants and increased pricing in grafton r dbm and bio implants  partially offset by a decline in base allograft tissue processing revenues due to the temporary suspension of base tissue processing and a decrease in the number of donors processed for our clients in compared to and by the suspension of sales of affirm tm 
foreign based revenues increased in to  from  in the increase in foreign based revenues was due to increased unit sales volume in all product lines 
consolidated net revenues in increased to  compared to consolidated revenues of  in the increase in was principally due to higher revenues in bio implants and product lines in other revenue mainly as a result of increased volume  partially offset by a decrease in grafton r dbm revenues as a result of reduced unit sales volume and a decrease in base tissue processing revenues as a result of processing fewer donors in compared to domestic net revenues increased slightly in to  from  in foreign based revenues increased to  in from  in the increase in foreign based revenues was primarily a result of increased unit sales volume in all product lines 
grafton r dbm segment revenues increased in to  from  in primarily due to increased world wide unit volume and the impact of price increases 
domestic grafton r dbm segment revenues increased in to  from revenues of  foreign based grafton r dbm segment revenues increased in to  from  in grafton r dbm segment revenues in of  decreased from revenues of  in foreign based grafton r dbm segment revenues increased in to  from  in  principally due to an increase in unit sales volume 
domestic grafton r dbm segment revenues decreased to  in from  in in  domestic grafton r dbm segment revenues were negatively impacted by a decrease in unit sales volume as a result of increased competition 
in and  grafton r dbm faced  and we expect it will continue to face  increasing competition as more companies develop and market products with characteristics similar to grafton r dbm 
base tissue segment revenues increased to  in from  in the increase is principally the result of a increase in bio implant revenues and a increase in osteopure tm femoral head processing revenues  partially offset by a decrease in base tissue processing revenues resulting from the temporary suspension of base tissue processing and a decrease in the number of donors processed for our clients in compared to the increase in bio implant revenues is principally due to increased unit volume in compared to when several bio implant tissue forms were in a launch mode  the ability to charge higher unit sale prices as a result of our direct distribution of principally all of those units to hospitals and surgeons  and the effects of the january  price increases 
base tissue segment revenues increased to  in from  in the increase is principally the result of a increase in bio implant revenues and a increase in osteopure tm femoral head processing revenues  partially offset by a decrease in base tissue processing revenues resulting from a decline in the number of donors processed for our clients 
the increase in bio implant revenues is principally due to increased unit volume and the ability to charge higher unit sale prices as a result of our direct distribution of some of those units to hospitals 
revenues from other product lines increased in to  from  in the increase principally resulted from improved volume in spinal metal implant systems and bovine products 
revenues from other product lines increased in to  from  in the increase principally resulted from improved volume in spinal metal implant systems and bovine products 
during   and  two of our clients  mtf and arc  in the grafton r dbm and base tissue segments together accounted for   and of consolidated net revenues  respectively 
we have processing agreements with each of these clients  which expire in december  and december   respectively 
see item clients and note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on these processing agreements 
gross profit gross profit as a percentage of net revenues was in  in  and in the decline in gross profit as a percentage of revenues in compared to is primarily due to i pre tax charges of  for the estimated cost to rework the tissue from donors placed in quarantine in  excess and obsolete inventory related to spinal implant systems and reserves for metal spinal implants that we do not expect to purchase  which are subject to a firm purchase commitments  ii the decline in base tissue processing revenues due to the temporary suspension of base tissue processing  iii the decline in donors processed for our clients  and iv the negative impact of underabsorption of production variances in the fourth quarter due to lower than normal allograft bone tissue processing levels due to the temporary suspension of base tissue processing in our two production facilities 
the decline in gross profit as a percentage of revenues in compared to principally resulted from i our direct distribution efforts which reduced gross profit margin by two percentage points in as a result of incurring additional costs equivalent to the incremental revenue we are recognizing from these efforts  ii the negative impact of underabsorption of fixed costs due to increased capacity as a result of our new processing facility  a decline in the number of donors processed  costs associated with implementation of new processing technologies  and bio implant and metal spinal implant product lines that have not yet achieved revenue levels sufficient to fully absorb production costs  iii a decline in base tissue processing revenue as a result of a decline in the number of donors processed  iv charges for excess metal spinal implant inventory of  and v a  charge for equipment which will no longer be utilized in our processing of allograft tissue 
we believe that the continued expansion of our direct distribution efforts will have a positive impact on our gross profit margins because although we will incur recovery costs in connection with tissue we distribute directly  we will not share a portion of the invoice price with our tissue bank clients as we do with tissue that we process for them and which they distribute 
in addition  we continue to develop and implement programs to improve gross profit margin through cost cutting initiatives  efficiency gains and reductions in the cost of materials 
however  we cannot provide any assurance that any of these programs will be successful 
marketing  selling  general and administrative expenses marketing  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased in to  from  in in  marketing  selling  general and administrative expenses were higher than expenses of  the decrease in relates mainly to i decreased legal fees due to the settlement of a number of our lawsuits in late and  see item legal proceedings and note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the settlement of lawsuits  ii a rescission in our funding of the american tissue services foundation  iii decreased marketing costs due to the launch in of new bio implant tissue forms  which increased marketing costs  and iv in provisions of  for reserves primarily for excess instruments sets associated with spinal implant systems and  for severance costs primarily related to the departure of an executive officer 
the increase in over relates mainly to i activities to secure additional sources of donated allograft tissue resulting in expenditures of  which included provisions related to our funding of the american tissue services foundation  ii increased legal fees in connection with various lawsuits to which we were a party  iii increased costs related to marketing  selling and promotional activities associated with grafton r dbm and the new bio implant tissue forms  iv a provision of  for excess instrument sets associated with spinal implant systems  and v a  provision for severance costs related primarily to the departure of an executive officer 
research and development expenses consolidated research and development expenses decreased in to  from  in research and development expenses in decreased from research and development expenses of  the decrease in from and from principally related to the completion of the development of bio implant tissue forms  which were launched in  but the development costs were recognized in and  the completion of new processing technology and packaging  which were implemented in  and the completion of development of grafton plus tm dbm  which was launched in the first quarter of income charge from litigation settlement in april   we settled a patent lawsuit and agreed to pay an aggregate of  in equal monthly installments without interest 
we recorded a charge of  related to this settlement representing the present value of the amounts due 
see item legal proceedings and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in november   we settled all claims which we had filed against depuy in the patent infringement lawsuit against gensci labs and gensci sciences 
as part of the settlement  depuy agreed to stop selling the gensci products accused of infringing our patents no later than february  and to pay us  we received payments and recognized income of  in each quarter of the remaining portion of the settlement of  was received in operating income loss we incurred a consolidated operating loss in of  compared to a consolidated operating loss of  in grafton r dbm segment operating income increased in to  from  in the increase in grafton r dbm segment operating income results principally from i decreased legal fees due to the resolution of lawsuits in late and second quarter  ii increased revenue levels  iii lower research and development costs associated with the development of grafton plus tm dbm  which was launched in the first quarter of  and iv lower marketing and selling costs 
we incurred an operating loss in the base tissue segment of  in compared to an operating loss of  in the base tissue segment operating loss principally resulted from i the underabsorption of production variances due to lower than normal allograft bone tissue processing levels as a result of the temporary suspension of base tissue processing in our two production facilities  ii the decline in base tissue processing revenues due to the temporary suspension of base tissue processing and a decline in the number of donors processed for our clients  iii reserves of  related to the estimated cost to rework tissue from donors placed in quarantine  iv costs associated with the settlement of the patent litigation regarding the bio d r threaded cortical bone dowel  including the cost of excess inventory of  and the litigation settlement charge of  iv increased legal fees  and vi a decline in donor processing revenue 
operating losses associated with other revenues were  and  in and  respectively 
the operating loss in increased over the operating loss in principally as a result of provisions of  for excess inventory and instrumentation for metal spinal implant systems and reserves related to the penalty associated with metal spinal implants  primarily affirm tm  that we do not expect to purchase  which are subject to a purchase commitments  partially offset by a decline in our funding of the american tissue services foundation 
we incurred a consolidated operating loss in of  compared to consolidated operating income of  in grafton r dbm segment operating income decreased in to  from  in the decrease in grafton r dbm segment operating income resulted principally from i increased costs associated with marketing  selling and promotional activities  ii increased legal fees  iii reduced revenue levels  and iv a decrease in patent litigation settlement payments of  we incurred an operating loss in the base tissue segment of  in compared to operating income of  in the operating loss in the base tissue segment principally resulted from i lower gross margins due to our direct distribution activities  ii a decline in donor processing revenue  iii the underabsorption of processing costs  iv increased legal fees  v provisions for excess instrument sets and equipment which will no longer be utilized in our production process  and vi increased costs for marketing  selling and promotional activities primarily associated with bio implants 
operating losses associated with other revenues were  and  in and  respectively 
the operating loss in increased over the operating loss in principally as a result of provisions for excess inventory and instrumentation for metal spinal implant systems and reserves for our funding of the american tissue services foundation 
other income expense other expense was  in compared to other income of  in the decrease was associated with an increase in interest expense on our long term debt as a result of higher interest rates and the recognition of interest expense on the debt for a full year in as compared to only a portion of the year in as the interest costs were capitalized during the construction of our new allograft processing facility and a decline in interest income as a result of lower interest rates  partially offset by the  gain on the sale of the polyactive tm polymer biomaterial technology and patents 
in  other income decreased  to  from  in the decrease was principally due to lower interest income as a result of a decline in interest rates and lower average cash balances available for investment and interest expense on our long term debt 
prior to  the majority of our interest costs were capitalized in connection with the construction of our new allograft tissue processing facility 
in late  we began to charge such interest costs to earnings since the facility was substantially complete 
income tax provision in and  we provided a benefit for income taxes primarily due to losses in our domestic operations and our ability to carryback and carryforward these losses 
we did not recognize any income taxes on foreign income in due primarily to our ability to utilize previously unrecognized foreign net operating loss carryforwards  which carry a full valuation allowance 
in addition  we reversed liabilities for previously deferred tax benefits of  that are no longer required 
in  we utilized approximately  of historical foreign net operating loss carryforwards to offset foreign taxable income 
in  no income tax benefit was recorded for foreign losses  principally as a result of the uncertainty of realization of such future tax benefits 
our effective income tax rate in was 
the effective income tax rate exceeded the federal statutory income tax rate principally due to the non recognition for tax purposes of foreign operating losses and the impact of domestic state income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources at december  we had cash and short term investments of  compared to  at december  we invest excess cash in us government backed securities and investment grade commercial paper of major us corporations 
working capital increased  to  at december  compared to  at december  the increase resulted primarily from the net proceeds received from the sale of million shares of our common stock  proceeds from the sale of the polyactive tm polymer biomaterial technology and patents and the sale of the operations of our subsidiary in the netherlands 
net cash used in operating activities was  in and  in the decrease resulted primarily from the decline in our net loss in compared to and improved collections on accounts receivable  partially offset by reductions in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
cash used in investing activities increased to  in from  in the increase is principally due to our net purchases of short term investments  partially offset by proceeds from the sale of the polyactive tm polymer biomaterial technology and patents  the sale of the operations of our subsidiary in the netherlands and a decrease in capital expenditures to  in from  in due to reduced spending on the construction of our new allograft tissue processing facility 
net cash provided by financing activities in was  an increase of  from  in in  we sold million shares of common stock  which in addition to the exercise of stock options and sales pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan  generated net proceeds of  we made  in principal payments pursuant to our long term debt 
we have a credit facility with a us bank that includes a  revolving line of credit  a building mortgage loan and an equipment term loan 
at december    was outstanding under the building mortgage loan and  was outstanding under the equipment term loan 
in  to support the  due under the settlement of certain patent litigation  we provided a declining irrevocable standby letter of credit in an original amount of  see item legal proceedings and note to consolidated financial statements 
as of december   the standby letter of credit has been reduced to  amounts committed under this standby letter of credit decreased over time based on a predetermined schedule concurrent with our monthly payments under the settlement and reduced the amounts available under the revolving line of credit 
as of december   no amounts were outstanding under the revolving line of credit and  was available 
in march   the credit facility was amended  to permanently waive our non compliance with the interest coverage ratio for the quarter ended december  in addition  if available cash  cash equivalents and short term investments decline below million at the end of any calendar month  the amendment gives the bank  at its option  the right to obtain a security interest in our general intangibles  including  but not limited to  our patents and patent applications 
the credit facility  as amended  is collateralized by domestic accounts receivable  domestic inventory  the new allograft tissue processing facility  including all equipment and improvements therein  and a pledge of of our ownership in our foreign subsidiaries 
the credit facility  as amended  imposes on us certain restrictive operating and financial covenants  including a restriction on our paying cash dividends  a restriction on our incurring or maintaining additional indebtedness  a restriction on our selling of assets or engaging in mergers or acquisitions and limitations on our ability to make cash advances in excess of certain amounts without the prior consent of the bank to our foreign operations or investments 
the credit facility also includes subjective acceleration provisions 
such provisions are based upon  in the reasonable opinion of the bank  the occurrence of any adverse or material change in the condition or affairs  financial or otherwise  of our business  which impairs the interests of the bank 
due to our expectation of improved financial performance and our expected compliance with our bank covenants in  we continue to classify the long term portion of our outstanding bank debt as long term 
however  there can be no assurance that our financial performance will improve or that we will comply with our bank covenants 
the bank has the right to approve  in advance  the form and substance of any equity capital transaction  except for a common stock transaction resulting in the issuance of less than of our total issued and outstanding capital stock as of the date of such transaction 
failure to comply with any of these restrictions could result in a default under this loan facility 
following a default  the bank may determine not to make any additional financing available under the revolving line of credit  could accelerate the indebtedness under the revolving credit facility  the equipment loan and or the mortgage  and could foreclose on the real and personal property securing the loans 
at december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of  which expire in varying amounts beginning in through  and state net operating loss carryforwards of  primarily to offset new jersey taxable income  which expire in varying amounts beginning in through we have provided valuation allowances for  in federal  and a corresponding amount of state  net operating loss carryforwards due to the uncertainty of realizing future tax benefits from these net operating loss carryforwards 
in addition  we have federal research and development credits of  which expire in varying amounts beginning in through  and state research and development and manufacturing credits of  primarily to offset new jersey income taxes  which expire in varying amounts beginning in through at december   certain of our foreign based subsidiaries have net operating loss carryforwards aggregating  expiring in varying amounts beginning through we have not recognized any benefit from these net operating loss carryforwards in the consolidated financial statements because realization of the future tax benefits is uncertain 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in february   we entered into a distribution agreement with alphatec manufacturing  inc  or alphatec  to market a pedicle screw system and a cervical plating system 
this agreement requires us to make minimum purchase commitments of  over the two year period beginning on april  a penalty of of any shortfall in the purchase commitment is required to be paid at the end of the first year of the commitment period and quarterly beginning in the second year of the commitment period 
in october   pursuant to a letter agreement  alphatec waived the purchase commitment of  for the first year of the commitment period april  to march  for a payment of  the purchase commitment of  for the second year april  to march  of the commitment period is still in effect 
in october   because of a higher than normal level of complaints  we suspended the sale and distribution of affirm tm 
due to the continued uncertainty surrounding the re introduction of affirm tm into the market  we have established a provision for all implant inventory and instrumentation of  in addition  due to this uncertainty  we have estimated that we will not purchase sufficient quantities of inventory to meet the aforementioned purchase commitment 
accordingly  we have recorded a reserve of  in for the estimated penalty for the second year commitment 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december   and the effects such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
less than after in thousands total one year years years long term debt     non cancelable operating lease obligations    medtronic litigation settlement payments  purchase commitment   represents forecasted purchases and the estimated penalty of  associated with a failure to meet the minimum purchase requirements 
assumes the purchases and penalties are satisfied ratably over the commitment period 
exclusive of the funds we raised in the sale of million shares of common stock in the second quarter of  which generated net proceeds of  in and  we experienced a decrease in available cash  cash equivalents and short term investment due to our continued investments in our business and the operating losses incurred in and we expect to continue to make investments in our business to support our direct distribution efforts and future programs and initiatives  which may further deplete our available cash balances 
we believe that our available cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  available lines of credit and anticipated future cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our forecasted cash needs in our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including o additional investments  if any  in inventories and deferred processing costs to support our direct distribution efforts  o the progress of our product development programs and the need and associated costs relating to regulatory approvals  if any  which may be needed to commercialize some of our products under development  or those commercialized whose regulatory status may change  and o the resources we devote to the development  manufacture and marketing of our services and products 
we may seek additional funding to meet the needs of our long term strategic plan 
we can provide no assurance that such additional funds will be available  or if available  that such funds will be available on favorable terms 
recent accounting developments effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
 beginning in we are no longer amortizing goodwill 
amortization of goodwill included in continuing operations was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
discontinued operations included  of goodwill amortization for each of the years ended december  and in addition  in accordance with the transition provisions of sfas no 
 we completed an evaluation of the carrying value of our goodwill as of january  and determined that there was no impact on our consolidated financial statements as a result of such evaluation 
in june   the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
addresses recognition  measurement  and reporting of costs associated with exit and disposal activities  including restructuring activities 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning january  we do not expect the adoption of this pronouncement to have a significant impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in november   the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  an interpretation of sfas statements no 
 and and rescission of fasb interpretation no 
 or fin fin clarifies the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  relating to the guarantor s accounting for  and disclosure of  the issuance of certain types of guarantees 
the disclosure requirements of fin are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods after december  the disclosure provisions have been implemented and no disclosures were required in the provisions for initial recognition and measurement are effective on a prospective basis for guarantees that are issued or modified after december   irrespective of the guarantor s year end 
fin requires that upon issuance of a guarantee  the entity must recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee 
adoption of fin in has not and is not expected to have a material effect on our results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
in january   the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 
 or fin  which addresses consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin expands the criteria for consideration in determining whether a variable interest entity should be consolidated by a business entity  and requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities which include  but are not limited to  special purpose entities  or spes to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risks among parties involved 
this interpretation applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
it applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june   to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  we do not currently have any spe s or variable interest entities  therefore  the adoption of fin is not expected to have any impact on our results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
impact of inflation and foreign currency exchange fluctuations the results of operations for the periods discussed have not been materially affected by inflation or foreign currency fluctuations

it is possible that our results of operations or liquidity and capital resources could be adversely affected by the ultimate outcome of the pending litigation or as a result of the costs of contesting such lawsuits 
risk factors we may need to secure additional financing to fund our long term strategic plan 
exclusive of the funds we raised in the sale of the million shares of common stock in the second quarter of  which generated net proceeds of  in and  we experienced a decrease in available cash  cash equivalents and short term investments due to our continued investments in our business and from operating losses incurred in and we expect to continue to make investments in our business to support our direct distribution efforts and future programs and initiatives  which may further deplete our available cash balances 
we believe that our available cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments  available lines of credit and anticipated future cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our forecasted cash needs in our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including o additional investments  if any  in inventories and deferred processing costs to support our direct distribution efforts  o the progress of our product development programs and the need and associated costs relating to regulatory approvals  if any  which may be needed to commercialize some of our products under development  or those commercialized whose regulatory status may change  and o the resources we devote to the development  manufacture and marketing of our services and products 
we may need to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity and or debt financing in private placements or public offerings to provide funds to meet the need of our long term strategic plan 
additional funds may not be available  or if available  may not be available on favorable terms 
further equity financings  if obtained  may substantially dilute the interest of our pre existing shareholders 
any additional debt financings may contain restrictive terms that limit our operating flexibility 
as a result  any future financings could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
failure to comply with covenants under our loan and security agreement could materially adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have amended our loan and security agreement and mortgage to obtain a waiver of a breach of a financial covenant for the year ended december   to provide revised financial covenants  to grant additional security and to extend our revolving line of credit through april  this loan facility provides a revolving credit facility  an equipment loan and a mortgage 
it also imposes on us certain restrictive operating and financial covenants 
the covenants significantly limit or prohibit  among other things  our ability to advance or incur additional indebtedness  create liens on our assets  pay dividends  sell assets  engage in mergers or acquisitions  or make investments without the consent of the bank 
failure to comply with any of these restrictions could result in a default under this loan facility 
the loan facility also includes subjective acceleration provisions 
such provisions are based upon  in the reasonable opinion of the bank  the occurrence of any adverse or material change in our condition or affairs  financial or otherwise  which impairs the interests of the bank 
following a default  the lender may determine not to make any additional financing available under the revolving line of credit  could accelerate the indebtedness under the revolving credit facility  the equipment loan and or the mortgage  and could foreclose on the real and personal property securing the loans 
foreclosure would adversely affect our continued operations and our ability to repay the indebtedness under the loan facility 
we may not have the funds to repay the debt upon acceleration 
even if available  the terms of any additional debt or equity financing that we may incur could restrict our operational flexibility and thereby adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our cash flows are expected to be adversely impacted by our focus on direct distribution 
commencing in the first half of  we began to distribute tissue forms directly to surgeons and hospitals 
we expect to continue to expand our direct distribution efforts to surgeons and hospitals in and beyond 
as a result  we expect that revenues from direct distribution of tissue will grow significantly as a percentage of our consolidated revenues over the next several years 
this change in distribution methodology has impacted and is expected to continue to have an impact on our cash flow 
as a greater percentage of our revenues are generated from direct shipments to hospitals and other healthcare providers  which typically pay invoices slower than our historical customer base  we expect that our days sales in accounts receivable may increase slightly 
we are dependent upon two primary clients who together provide a majority of our revenues 
we are the processor of allograft bone tissue for large national and international not for profit organizations 
during  mtf and arc accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our revenues 
we entered into a year exclusive processing agreement with arc in december   which we amended in  and a non exclusive processing agreement with mtf in june   which expires on december  the loss of either mtf or arc as a client or a substantial reduction in the amount of allograft bone tissue which we process for either entity would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our dependence upon a limited supply of human donors may curtail business expansion 
our allograft bone tissue processing business primarily depends upon the availability of bone and related connective tissue from human donors recovered by our clients and tro s and tissue banks who recover donated human cadaveric tissue for us 
we rely on the efforts of not for profit donor procurement agencies  including our current clients  to educate the public and foster an increased willingness to donate bone tissue 
these organizations may not be able to find a sufficient number of persons to donate  or may not be willing to provide  sufficient amounts of tissue to meet present or future demand for either allograft bone tissue or any allograft bone tissue based osteogenic materials we are developing 
although we have taken steps to address this tissue supply problem  we cannot assure you that these efforts will be successful in the future or that we will otherwise be able to secure a sufficient supply of tissue 
our inability to secure enough donor tissue to meet our demands could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we face strong competitive threats from firms with greater financial resources and lower costs 
the allograft bone tissue we process competes in the bone graft market with autograft bone tissue  synthetic bone void fillers  growth factors and allograft bone tissue processed by others  primarily tissue banks 
autograft bone tissue has traditionally been the primary choice for surgeons and we believe autograft bone tissue still maintains approximately a share of the united states bone graft market 
in europe  bone graft substitutes  such as bovine bone tissue and synthetics  currently comprise most of the bone grafting market 
many of our competitors have greater financial resources than we do 
for numerous circumstances and procedures for which autograft bone tissue transplantation is either not feasible or not desirable  there are a number of competing alternatives available  including allograft bone tissue processed by others and bone graft substitutes 
in recent years  our grafton r dbm products have faced increasing competitive pressures as more companies have developed  or have announced they are developing  products with characteristics similar to grafton r dbm 
certain of those competitors have  in turn  partnered with large orthopaedic and spine companies to market the competing products they have developed 
we expect that this competition will continue in the future 
many of these competitors have research and development  marketing and other resources that are significantly greater than ours 
they also offer a full line of metal implants and other products used in spinal surgeries 
this could give them a competitive advantage over us since they can offer surgeons a more complete line of products than we currently can 
we believe that a majority of the cadaveric bone banks operating in the united states are engaged in processing allograft bone tissue for transplantation 
many of these bone tissue banks are not for profit organizations  and  as such  they may be able to supply processing services at a lower cost than we can 
several for profit companies  certain of which have substantially greater resources then we do  are processing  marketing and distributing allograft tissue 
we compete with such entities on the basis of our advanced processing technology and the quality and quantity of the bone tissue our processing yields 
since we introduced our allograft bone tissue processing technology in  certain competing processors have claimed to have developed technology similar to that which we use 
we may not be able to compete successfully in the area of allograft bone tissue processing and distribution 
if we were to lose a patent lawsuit in which another party is asserting that our products infringe its patents  we would likely be prohibited from marketing those products and could also be liable for significant damages 
either or both of these results may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we lose a patent lawsuit in which we are claiming that another party s products are infringing our patents and thus  are unable to enforce our patents  it may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our revenues will depend upon reimbursement from public and private insurers and national health systems 
the continued ability of our clients to pay our processing charges for the processing of allograft bone tissue  depends upon our clients ability to distribute processed allograft bone tissue and collect fees from their clients  which are typically hospitals 
the ability of hospitals to pay fees to our clients  or directly to us for allograft bone tissue or non allograft spinal implant systems distributed directly by us to the hospitals  depends in part on the extent to which reimbursement for the costs of such materials and related treatments will continue to be available from government health administration authorities  private health coverage insurers and other organizations 
we may have difficulty gaining market acceptance for our products and services if government and third party payors do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement 
the medical community could choose not to use our allograft bone tissue products 
we believe the market for allograft bone tissue will continue to be based primarily upon the use of such products by physicians specializing in the orthopaedic  neurological and oral maxillofacial surgical areas 
our future growth depends in part upon such physicians wider use of allograft bone tissue as an alternative to autograft bone tissue and other available materials and treatments 
we have tried to educate physicians through our marketing activities 
our future efforts in this regard may fail to generate additional demand for our allograft tissue forms 
governmental regulation could restrict the use of our products 
in the united states  the procurement and transplantation of allograft bone tissue is subject to federal law pursuant to nota  a criminal statute which prohibits the purchase and sale of human organs used in human transplantation  including bone and related tissue  for valuable consideration 
nota permits reasonable payments associated with the removal  transportation  processing  preservation  quality control  implantation and storage of human bone tissue 
we provide services in all of these areas  with the exception of removal and implantation and receive payments for all such services 
we make payments to certain of our clients and tro s and tissue banks for their services related to recovering allograft bone tissue on our behalf 
if nota is interpreted or enforced in a manner which prevents us from receiving payment for services we render or which prevents us from paying tro s or certain of our clients for the services they render for us  our business could be materially  adversely affected 
we are engaged through our direct sales employees and our independent sales representatives in ongoing efforts designed to educate the medical community as to the benefits of processed allograft bone tissue and in particular our allograft bone tissue forms  and we intend to continue our educational activities 
although we believe that nota permits payments in connection with these educational efforts as reasonable payments associated with the processing  transportation and implantation of our allograft bone tissue forms  payments in connections with such education efforts are not exempt from nota s restrictions and our inability to make such payments in connection with our education efforts may prevent us from paying our sales representatives for their education efforts and could adversely affect our business and prospects 
no federal agency or court has determined whether nota is  or will be  applicable to every allograft bone tissue based material which our processing technologies may generate 
assuming that nota applies to our processing of allograft bone tissue  we believe that we comply with nota  but there can be no assurance that more restrictive interpretations of  or amendments to  nota will not be adopted in the future which would call into question one or more aspects of our method of operations 
our products are extensively regulated by federal and  in certain states  by state agencies in the united states 
failure to comply with these requirements may subject us to administrative or judicial sanctions  such as the fda s refusal to clear pending applications  warning letters  product recalls  product seizures  total or partial suspension of production or distribution  civil penalties  injunctions and or criminal prosecution 
in the united states  the allograft bone tissues that we process are regulated by the fda as human tissue based products under section of the public health service act  and under certain circumstances  may be regulated as a medical device under the food  drug  and cosmetic act 
fda regulations do not require that human tissue based products be cleared or approved before they are marketed 
we are  however  required to register and list these products with the fda and to comply with regulations concerning tissue donor screening and testing  and related procedures and record keeping 
the fda periodically inspects tissue processors to determine compliance with these requirements 
the fda has proposed  but not yet finalized  good tissue practice regulations that would impose requirements on the manufacture of human tissue based products  including tissue recovery  donor screening  donor testing  processing  storage  labeling  packaging  and distribution 
the human tissue based product category is a relatively new one in fda regulations  and it is possible that the fda will change its approach to human tissue based products in general or to particular categories of products to require fda clearance or approval or otherwise restrict distribution 
the metal spinal implant products that we distribute in the united states are regulated by the fda as medical devices 
medical devices generally require fda approval or clearance before they may be marketed 
there are two processes by which medical devices can receive approval or clearance 
some products may qualify for clearance under the k process  in which the manufacturer or processor demonstrates that its product is substantially equivalent to another lawfully marketed product ie  that it has the same intended use and is as safe and effective as a lawfully marketed product and does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness as the lawfully marketed product 
k submissions usually include safety and performance data  and in some cases  the submission must include clinical data 
marketing may commence if and when the fda issues a letter finding substantial equivalence 
all of the metal spinal implant systems we distribute are being marketed pursuant to k clearances 
if a medical device does not qualify for the k process  the product may not be distributed until a premarket approval application has been approved by the fda 
premarket approval applications must demonstrate product safety and effectiveness 
a premarket approval application is typically a complex submission  usually including the results of preclinical and clinical studies 
the manufacturer must also pass a premarket inspection of its compliance with fda s quality systems regulation 
marketing may commence if and when the fda issues a premarket approval 
the fda has changed the regulatory status of our grafton r dbm products and the consequences of that decision are uncertain 
in march   the fda informed us that the agency is changing the regulatory status of grafton r dbm and will henceforth regulate it as a medical device 
medical device regulation is a more stringent category of regulation and  in particular  medical devices require fda clearance or approval 
we believe the fda s change in its position regarding grafton r dbm results from its decision to regulate all demineralized bone with a carrier  including those processed and marketed by some of our competitors  as medical devices 
we communicated to the fda that we believe its initial designation of grafton r dbm as a human tissue based product was and still is correct 
in this regard  we have provided information to the fda that we believe should cause the fda to reconsider the position they have expressed in their march  letter as it relates to grafton r dbm 
on february   we met with representatives of the fda to present our facts and views 
communication and interaction with the fda on this issue is continuing 
if we are unsuccessful in that effort  we will be required to obtain a medical device approval or clearance  and to comply with medical device postmarketing obligations 
we believe that grafton r dbm will be eligible for k clearance  but we cannot be sure that we will not be required to obtain premarket approval  or that the fda will issue any clearance or approval in a timely fashion  or at all 
in its march  letter regarding grafton r dbm  the fda stated that it intends to allow us a reasonable period of time to obtain clearance for grafton r dbm  and we will continue to process and distribute grafton r dbm during this period 
we cannot be sure that the fda will clear or approve our submission or will clear or approve any or all claims that we currently make for grafton r dbm 
failure to obtain fda clearance or approval of grafton r dbm  or any limitation on grafton r dbm claims could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 
we also market grafton plus tm dbm as a human tissue based product 
the fda s determination regarding grafton r dbm is also likely to be applied to grafton plus tm dbm 
if the fda maintains its position that all demineralized bone with a carrier is a medical device  we would also be required to obtain fda clearance or approval for grafton plus tm dbm and any other dbm carrier product we may process  and to comply with other medical device requirements for that product 
failure to obtain fda clearance or approval  if required  or any limitation on grafton plus tm dbm could adversely affect us 
allograft bone tissue and tissue banking activities  such as tissue donation and recovery and tissue processing  are regulated in virtually all countries in which we operate outside the united states 
the regulatory schemes and specific requirements for these products and activities vary from country to country 
there are no common or harmonized regulatory approvals or programs for these products and activities  such as there are for medical devices marketed in the european union 
we believe that we comply with the national regulations in the countries in which we currently operate or in the countries we plan to operate in the future  although there can be no assurances that we will be able to do so in the future 
loss of key persons could limit our success 
our success depends upon the continued contributions of our executive officers and scientific and technical personnel 
the competition for qualified personnel is intense  and the loss of services of our key personnel  particularly members of senior management  could adversely affect our business 
if we are unable to enforce our patents or if it is determined that we infringe patents held by others it could damage our business 
we consider our allograft bone tissue processing technology and procedures proprietary and rely primarily on trade secrets and patents to protect our technology and innovations 
consultants employed by third parties and persons working in conjunction with medical institutions unaffiliated with us have conducted significant research and development for our products 
accordingly  disputes may arise concerning the proprietary rights to information applied to our projects which have been independently developed by such consultants or medical institutions 
in addition  you should recognize that although we have attempted to protect our technology with patents  our existing patents may prove invalid or unenforceable as to products or services marketed by our competitors 
our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents 
moreover  our existing or future products and technologies could be found to infringe the patents of others 
prosecuting and defending patent lawsuits is very expensive 
we are committed to aggressively asserting and defending our technology and related intellectual property which we have spent a significant amount of money to develop 
in addition  the industry in which we compete is known for having a great deal of litigation involving patents 
these factors could cause us to become involved in new patent litigation in the future 
the expense of prosecuting or defending these future lawsuits could also have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our products face competitive threats from alternate technologies 
the primary advantage of synthetic bone substitutes and growth factors as compared to allograft bone tissue is that they do not depend on the availability of donated human tissue 
in addition  members of the medical community and the general public may perceive synthetic materials and growth factors as safer than allograft based bone tissue 
the allograft bone tissue we process may be incapable of competing successfully with synthetic bone substitutes and growth factors which are developed and commercialized by others  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
companies are also developing artificial disks which would be used to replace a patient s own injured  degenerated or diseased spinal disks 
if these disks are successfully developed and commercialized  they could have a negative impact on our bio implant business and  therefore  have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we may incur losses from product liability lawsuits 
the testing and use of human allograft bone tissue  bovine tissue products and medical devices manufactured by others and which we distribute  entail inherent risks of medical complications for patients and therefore may result in product liability claims against us 
further  our agreements with our allograft bone tissue processing clients provide for indemnification by us for liabilities arising out of defects in allograft bone tissue they distribute which is caused by our processing 
see item legal proceedings 
we presently maintain product liability insurance in the amount of million per occurrence and per year in the aggregate 
we may be unable to maintain such insurance in the future and such insurance may not be sufficient to cover all claims made against us or all types of liabilities which may be asserted against us 
we face potential lawsuits or governmental enforcement activities based on hazardous waste we generate in our operations 
our allograft bone tissue processing in both the united states and europe generates waste materials  which  in the united states  are classified as medical waste and or hazardous waste under regulations promulgated by the united states environmental protection agency and the new jersey department of environmental protection 
we segregate our waste materials and dispose of them through a licensed hazardous waste transporter in compliance with applicable regulations in both the united states and europe 
our failure to fully comply with any environmental regulations could result in the imposition of penalties  sanctions or  in some cases  private lawsuits  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we rely on our independent sales agents and sales representatives to educate surgeons concerning our products and to market our products 
our success depends largely upon arrangements we have with independent sales agents and sales representatives whereby they educate surgeons concerning our products and market our products 
these independent sales agents and sales representatives may terminate their relationship with us  or devote insufficient sales efforts to our products 
we do not control our independent sales agents and they may not be successful in implementing our marketing plans 
our failure to attract and retain skilled independent sales agents and sale representatives could have an adverse effect on our operations 
the issuance of preferred stock may adversely affect rights of common stockholders or discourage a takeover 
under our amended and restated certificate of incorporation  our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences and privileges of those shares without any further vote or action by our stockholders 
the rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any shares of preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
in january   our board of directors authorized shares of series e preferred stock in connection with its adoption of a stockholder rights plan  under which we issued rights to purchase series e preferred stock to holders of our common stock 
upon certain triggering events  such rights become exercisable to purchase common stock or  in the discretion of our board of directors  series e preferred stock at a price substantially discounted from the then current market price of the common stock 
our stockholder rights plan could generally discourage a merger or tender offer involving our securities that is not approved by our board of directors by increasing the cost of effecting any such transaction and  accordingly  could have an adverse impact on stockholders who might want to vote in favor of such merger or participate in such tender offer 
while we have no present intention to authorize any additional series of preferred stock  such issuance  while providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes  could also have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
the preferred stock may have other rights  including economic rights senior to the common stock  and  as a result  the issuance thereof could have a material adverse effect on the market value of the common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the united states  we are exposed to interest rate risk 
changes in interest rates affect interest income earned on cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and interest expense on short term and long term debt 
we do not enter into derivative transactions related to our cash  cash equivalents  short term investments or debt 
accordingly  we are subject to changes in interest rates 
based on our december  cash and cash equivalents and long term debt  a change in interest rates would impact our results of operations by approximately  the value of the us dollar affects our financial results 
although currently not significant  changes in exchange rates may positively or negatively affect revenues  gross margins  operating expenses and net income in the future 
we do not maintain hedging programs to mitigate the potential exposures of exchange rate risk 
accordingly  our results of operations are adversely affected by the strengthening of the us dollar against currencies in which we sell products and services or a weakening exchange rate against currencies in which we incur costs 
based on the operating results of our foreign operations for the year ended december   a change in the exchange rates would impact our results of operations by approximately  because of the foregoing factors  as well as other variables affecting our operating results  past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance
