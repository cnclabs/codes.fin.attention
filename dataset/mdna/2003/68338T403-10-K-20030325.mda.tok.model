results of operations overview onvia is a leading business to government bg marketplace for government agency buyers and business suppliers 
the onvia network helps business suppliers secure government contracts and helps government agencies find suppliers online 
onvia s network manages the distribution and reporting of bid requests from government agencies nationwide in the billion federal  state and local government marketplace 
business suppliers no longer have to scour newspapers  trade periodicals  or the internet in search of government opportunities 
our network efficiently matches government agency bid requests to suppliers of the requested commodity or services  saving time and money on both sides of the procurement process 
government agencies reduce costs by streamlining the bid process and create a larger and more diverse pool of suppliers 
increased bid competition drives costs down for government agencies  and lowers marketing and administrative expenses 
agencies and suppliers also have access to our bid library that contains thousands of expired bids issued within the last years 
information in our bid library helps agencies save time preparing new bid opportunities  and suppliers can use this library to analyze purchasing trends  identify potential future customers and access federal award information 
our bg network consists of two complementary bg products  demandstar by onvia and the onvia guide  which automate the process of request for proposal rfp and request for quote rfq creation  posting and document distribution for agencies and allows business suppliers access to federal  state and local government agency procurement opportunities nationwide 
demandstar by onvia subscribers to the demandstar by onvia service have access to bid requests from approximately signed government agencies 
bid requests from agencies are supplemented by bids aggregated via our dedicated in house research team 
subscribers have access to agency bid requests by commodity or location  and to our library of small business tools and government contracting reference materials 
subscription revenues from demandstar by onvia are generated from annual subscriptions to this service and the subscription fee is recognized ratably over the term of the subscription 

table of contents the onvia guide our proprietary onvia guide service allows business users the opportunity to participate in government procurement contracts in business categories over six vertical markets 
the vertical markets currently served are architectural  engineering and environmental services it telecom consulting services construction services and building supplies operations and maintenance services transportation subscription revenues from the onvia guide are generated from monthly  quarterly and annual subscriptions to this service and the subscription fee is recognized ratably over the term of the subscription 
in october  we discontinued our monthly product  but will continue to renew and service our existing monthly subscribers 
we added a quarterly product in august this product will provide customers with a longer initial period to experience the value of the product through increased lead flow 
we currently have approximately  subscribing business suppliers to whom we published approximately  bids in  compared to approximately  bids in our subscriber count has remained relatively flat compared to  which reflects our efforts to grow our premium subscribers at the expense of lower value customers 
premium subscribers over the last six months of we directed our marketing and sales activities to sign and retain customers that meet our premium profile 
premium subscribers are defined as customers with higher average revenue and higher retention  and include national  regional and state subscribers 
premium subscribers receive more government leads  directly leading to higher customer satisfaction and retention rates 
our focus on acquisition and retention of these premium customers should continue to positively impact our average cash value per subscriber 
our premium subscribers represented over of our total subscriber base in the fourth quarter of  compared to in the fourth quarter of during we introduced new state  regional and metro area products designed to expand our geographic offerings  and tailored to attract new premium subscribers and increase average cash value per transaction 
during the fourth quarter of we recorded over  new and repeat transactions  compared to  in the same quarter in  a decrease of  transactions reflecting our focus on acquiring premium subscribers and the discontinuation of our monthly product 
we increased our average cash value per transaction to in the fourth quarter of  compared to in the first quarter of  an increase of 
this increase in cash transaction value demonstrates the success we ve seen in acquiring new premium customers and upgrading our existing customers to premium products 
premium data in january  we introduced premium data products  which include post award and pre award bid data 
the post award information offers additional revenue opportunities for many suppliers and most specifically subcontractors 
the pre award bid data offers additional advantages to our subscribers that are interested in participating in the development of the bids and rfps 
we anticipate that the addition of premium data will positively impact our average cash value per subscriber 

table of contents agency adoption we added new agencies in and increased the number of agency submitted bids by over we expect that growth in the number of agencies utilizing our service will be relatively modest in the near term as the company becomes more targeted in the signing of new agencies in specific geographic regions 
corporate customers we also target corporate customers to adopt our bid notification product 
corporate customers include larger companies who purchase multi seat licenses for daily lead notification  or purchase onvia data for redistribution to their employees or customers  or for remarketing their own products 
during we signed a year contract with a new corporate customer  with an aggregate value of approximately million  to provide onvia data for redistribution 
the contract can be terminated for any reason by either party after a period of months upon months written notice 
we also renewed an existing corporate customer for an additional two years for an aggregate value of approximately  in february was the first year we exclusively focused on our bg operations 
in view of the significant changes in the nature of our business  we believe that a historical comparison of revenue and operating results is not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied on as an indication of future performance 
this is particularly true of companies such as onvia that operate in new and rapidly evolving markets 
as a result  onvia s prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties encountered by companies in their early stages of development  particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets 
see risk factors for a more complete description of the many risks onvia faces 
recent developments in march  our board of directors approved a cash distribution of per common share  or approximately million  to return excess capital to onvia s stockholders 
the distribution occurred on may  as a result of the cash distribution  and pursuant to the guidance in fasb interpretation no 
fin  the exercise price of all active employee stock options outstanding on or prior to the distribution date was reduced 
outstanding options with a strike price greater than or equal to the fair market value fmv of the stock on the effective date of the distribution received a strike price reduction equal to the cash distribution  or per share 
for outstanding options with a strike price below the fmv on the date of the distribution the reduction was such that the aggregate intrinsic value of the options immediately after the change was not greater than the aggregate intrinsic value immediately prior to the change  therefore  there was no accounting impact as a result of the change 
in may  we were notified by nasdaq that our common stock had failed to maintain a minimum closing bid price of per share during the day period ending on may  as required by nasdaq marketplace rule  and that our common stock would be delisted if  by may   we did not either transfer our listing to the nasdaq small cap market or file an appeal to the nasdaq listing qualification panel 
as a response  on may   we filed an appeal before the nasdaq listing qualifications panel and proposed a one for ten reverse stock split to remain listed on the nasdaq national market 
on july   onvia s stockholders approved the one for ten reverse stock split to bring the company s share price above the minimum trading price required for continued nasdaq listing and to create a stock price more suitable for attracting new investors  including institutional investors 
the stock split was effective on july  on august   we received notification from nasdaq that the company had demonstrated a closing bid price of at least per share as required by nasdaq and  therefore  nasdaq made the determination to continue the listing of onvia s securities on the nasdaq national market and to close the hearing file

significant accounting policies and management estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of commitments and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we believe the following are our most critical accounting policies and estimates 
revenue recognition subscription revenues are generated from monthly  quarterly and annual subscriptions for our services 
in october we discontinued our monthly product  but we will continue to renew and service our existing monthly subscribers 
subscription revenue is amortized over the term of the service provided 
unearned revenue at december  consists of payments received for prepaid annual and quarterly subscriptions whose terms extend into prior to the closure of our bb website  we also generated revenue from the sale of computer and office products 
product revenue was recognized upon receipt of product by the customer  including any shipping and handling billed to the customer 
we acted as principal in those transactions because orders were initiated directly on our website  we took title to the goods during shipment  and had economic risk related to collection  customer service and returns 
in conjunction with the product outsourcing agreement effective january   these risks were transferred to firstsource corp 
firstsource 
we closed the bb website later in revenues from licensing technology  exchange services and advertising were recognized when the transaction occurred  ratably over the duration of the placement  or over the term of the agreement  as appropriate 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
our allowance  both in total and as a percentage of total accounts receivable  has decreased from to the decrease is primarily because we have experienced higher collections on our government network subscriptions than we had estimated at december  if the 
table of contents financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required  and our ability to recognize sales to certain customers may be affected 
lease obligations in conjunction with the closure of our canadian operations and bb exchange and the elimination of our outside sales force  we recorded a charge during to accrue rental payments on our idle office space leases through december we periodically review the adequacy of our estimates and due to the depressed commercial real estate market and the continued softening of sublease rates in seattle we determined that an additional accrual was necessary

this additional accrual covers our remaining contractual obligations assuming that we will sublease our idle space in mid at estimated current market rates  which are below our contractually obligated rates  through the remainder of the lease obligations 
the lease terms expire on dates ranging from through we currently have approximately  square feet of idle office space in the seattle market 
at december   the total accrual related to future lease payments and estimated broker fees on our idle office space was million 
the obligation for office space under lease  which includes the million accrual  exceeds million 
should it take longer to sublease the excess office space or should the sublease amount be lower than our estimates  the actual cost could exceed the amount accrued

the change to net cash used in financing activities in from net cash provided by financing activities in is primarily attributable to the repurchase of common stock in compared to the sale of equity securities in our initial public offering in the first quarter of our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors 
for example  our pace of expansion will affect our future capital requirements  as will our decision to acquire or invest in complementary businesses and technologies 
further  our ability to sublease or dispose of our idle office space  for which we have approximately million accrued at december   will affect our future liquidity  however  we believe that the existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements under existing operating plans for the foreseeable future 
we expect our gross margin to remain relatively flat in the foreseeable future  however  it may vary in direct relationship to the number of new products we offer 
if we engage in merger or acquisition transactions or our overall operating plans change  we may require additional equity or debt financing to meet future working capital needs  which may have a dilutive effect on existing stockholders 
we cannot make assurances that if additional financing is required  it will be available or  that such financing can be obtained on satisfactory terms 
based upon our current projections  our management estimates that we will reach cash flow profitability by the end of the second quarter of this guidance on cash flow profitability is dependent upon market adoption of our new premium award and bid pipeline information products over the next few months
