item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note segment and geographical information 
sales rayonier s sales as reclassified for discontinued operations for the three years ended december   were as follows in millions year ended december performance fibers cellulose specialties absorbent materials total performance fibers timber and land timber land total timber and land wood products lumber mdf total wood products other intersegment eliminations total sales    rayonier has customers in countries  and percent of the company s sales of billion were made to customers outside the united states 
performance fibers rayonier is a leading manufacturer of high performance cellulose fibers 
the company owns and operates fiber production facilities in jesup  ga and fernandina beach  fl  with a combined annual capacity of approximately  metric tons 
to meet customers needs these facilities are capable of manufacturing more than different grades of performance fibers 
the jesup facility can produce approximately  metric tons of performance fibers  or percent of rayonier s total capacity 
the fernandina beach facility can produce approximately  metric tons of performance fibers  or percent of the company s total capacity 
rayonier produces and sells these performance fibers primarily to meet specific customer orders and specifications throughout the world 
the customers then produce a wide variety of consumer and industrial products 
approximately two thirds of rayonier s performance fibers sales are exported to customers  primarily in asia  europe and latin america 
approximately percent of performance fibers sales are made directly by rayonier sales personnel  with the remainder made through independent sales agents primarily to export locations 
this segment includes two major product lines cellulose specialties and absorbent materials 
cellulose specialties rayonier is one of the world s leading producers of specialty cellulose products  most of which are used in dissolving chemical applications that require a highly purified form of cellulose 
cellulose specialties products are used in a wide variety of end uses such as acetate textile fibers  rigid packaging  photographic film  impact resistant plastics  cigarette filters  high tenacity rayon yarn for tires and industrial hoses  pharmaceuticals  cosmetics  detergents  sausage casings  food products  thickeners for oil well drilling muds  lacquers  paints  printing inks  explosives and lcd screens 
in addition  cellulose specialties include high value specialty paper applications used for decorative laminates for counter tops  automotive air and oil filters  shoe innersoles  battery separators  circuit boards and filter media for the food industry 
rayonier concentrates on and is a leading producer of the most highly valued  technologically demanding forms of cellulose specialty products  such as cellulose acetate and high purity cellulose ethers 
absorbent materials rayonier is a supplier of performance fibers for absorbent hygiene products 
these fibers are typically referred to as fluff fibers and are used as an absorbent medium in products such as disposable baby diapers  feminine hygiene products  incontinence pads  convalescent bed pads  industrial towels and wipes and non woven fabrics 
the absorbent materials product line also includes paper applications that are made as a secondary product to fluff fibers to help match inconsistencies in demand to capacity 
these paper applications usually represent less than percent of total performance fibers production and are used in the manufacture of bond  book and printing paper 
rayonier also produces and markets an engineered absorbent core material that goes into thin super absorbent sanitary napkins and diaper products 
a  ton per year manufacturing facility in jesup  ga was completed in to bring manufacturing in house and aid in the continued development of these products 
although this is a developing business that is currently a very small percentage of the product line  it is expected to increase its contribution to segment results in future years 
timber and land rayonier manages timberlands  sells standing timber at auction to third parties and also sells delivered logs  and sells its timberland for large tract conservation and real estate development 
in the us  the company manages the reportable segment through rayonier timberlands operating company lp rtoc  a wholly owned limited partnership 
the segment executes its strategies in two ways timber and land sales 
timber rayonier owns  leases or controls approximately million acres of timberlands as of december   as follows in thousands of acres region total acres fee owned acres long term leased acres southeast u 
s   northwest us new zealand total   excluded above are approximately  acres managed by rayonier in australia   acres managed in new zealand and  acres of non productive  non harvestable or native vegetation land in new zealand 
on october   rayonier  through its wholly owned subsidiary  rtoc  acquired approximately  owned and leased acres of timberland in georgia  florida and alabama from jefferson smurfit corporation in a business combination accounted for by the purchase method 
the company s southeastern us timberlands consist of approximately million acres located primarily in georgia  florida and alabama 
their proximity to pulp  paper and lumber mills results in significant competition for the purchase of the timber 
approximately percent of timber harvest represents high value wood sold primarily to lumber mills 
the balance is pulpwood used for making pulp and paper 
softwoods are the predominant species on the southeastern us timberlands and include loblolly and slash pine  while hardwoods  the minor species  include red oak  sweet gum  black gum  red maple  cypress and green ash 
through advanced silvicultural practices  the company has increased volume per acre of timber available for harvest from its southeastern us timberlands by approximately percent per year 
this is a primary factor behind an increasing pine harvest trend over the past years 
these practices are also being utilized by the company in the management of the timberlands acquired in  with an increasing trend of similar magnitude anticipated 
northwestern us timberlands consist of approximately  acres primarily on the olympic peninsula in western washington state 
all are owned in fee and consist almost entirely of second growth trees 
these timberlands are primarily softwood stands  with approximately percent hemlock and the remainder douglas fir  western red cedar and spruce 
hardwood timber stands consist principally of alder and maple 
the company s new zealand forest assets subsequent to the sale of its new zealand east coast operations  see note sale of new zealand east coast timber operations consist of  acres of fee owned timberland  plus crown forest licenses that provide the right to grow and harvest timber on approximately  acres of government owned timberland for a minimum period of years 
approximately percent of these timberlands consist of radiata pine  well suited for high quality lumber and panel products 
the balance is douglas fir and other species 
timber is grown and sold for both domestic new zealand uses and for export  primarily to the pacific rim markets 
in addition  the company manages timberlands for other parties in new zealand and australia 
rayonier manages timberlands  endeavoring to scientifically develop forests to their maximum economic value 
the average rotation age for timber from the southeastern us primarily southern pine is years 
the average rotation age for timber destined for domestic and export markets from the northwestern us primarily hemlock and douglas fir is to years 
the average rotation age for timber grown in new zealand primarily radiata pine is to years 
timber in the southeast us is saw timber and pulpwood  while timber in the northwest us and new zealand is primarily saw timber 
rayonier sells timber through a public auction process  predominantly to third parties and also sells delivered logs 
by requiring the company s other operating units to competitively bid for their timber and wood requirements  the company believes it can maximize the true economic return on its investments 
in  approximately percent of the company s standing timber sales were made to third parties 
rayonier s third party timber sales are made on either a lump sum or pay as cut basis 
on a lump sum basis  a minimum percent initial payment is required  title and risk of loss are transferred and installment payments are made in advance for the volume to be cut 
on a pay as cut basis  a percent deposit and percent performance bond are required 
payments are made as the timber is cut 
in the northwestern us  the majority of sales are lump sum due to large  financially stable customers and market practices 
in the southeastern us  where the majority of customers are smaller  family owned businesses  the majority of sales are pay as cut 
the company manages its timberlands in conformity with best forest industry practices 
a key to success is the extensive application of rayonier s silvicultural expertise to species selection for plantations  soil preparation  thinning of timber stands  pruning of selected species  fertilization and careful timing of the harvest  all of which are designed to maximize value while responding to environmental needs 
the following table sets forth timberland acres in thousands as of december   by region and by timber classification region softwood plantation hardwood lands non forest total southeast u 
s   northwest us new zealand total   includes only fee and leased timberlands and excludes management only agreements in new zealand and australia 
merchantable timber inventory is an estimate of the amount of standing timber at the earliest age that it could be economically harvested 
estimates are based on an inventory system that continually involves periodic statistical sampling of the timberlands 
adjustments are made on the basis of growth estimates  harvest information and market conditions 
the following table sets forth the estimated volumes of merchantable timber by location and type  as of december  region softwood hardwood total equivalent total  in thousands of short green tons southeast us  in thousands of short green tons   northwest us  in millions of board feet    new zealand  in thousands of cubic meters    land rayonier invests in timberlands seeking to maximize its total return from a full cycle of ownership 
the end cycle includes selling portions of its timberland base to capture the appreciated value of the underlying asset 
this program includes selling timberland for others to manage and harvest  and selling hbu timberland more valuable for commercial or residential development or conservation purposes 
in november  the company announced that it would routinely sell percent to percent of its timberland base each year in order to capture its appreciated value on a more regular basis 
timberland will be replaced opportunistically when it can be acquired at a discount to long term market trends 
timberland sales for the three years ended december   are summarized in the following table thousands of dollars  except acres sold timberland sales    operating income    acres sold    wood products the wood products business segment manufactures and sells dimension and specialty lumber and mdf 
rayonier operates three lumber manufacturing facilities in the us that produce southern pine and specialty lumber for residential construction and industrial uses 
the mills located at baxley  eatonton  and swainsboro  ga  have a combined annual capacity of approximately million board feet of lumber  while also producing approximately  tons of wood chips for pulping 
lumber sales are primarily to customers in the southeastern u 
s 
and caribbean markets 
rayonier sales personnel sell most of the lumber  however sales to certain export locations are made through independent agents 
substantially all of the wood chip production is sold at market prices to rayonier s jesup  ga  performance fibers facility  accounting for approximately percent of that facility s total wood consumption 
the company operates a premium grade mdf facility in new zealand with an annual capacity of  cubic meters 
the company s mdf is marketed worldwide by rayonier personnel  independent sales agents and a new zealand distributor 
other rayonier also operates a log trading business and is an exporter and trader of softwood logs in the us  new zealand  chile and russia 
the company purchases and harvests timber for sale in domestic and export markets 
timber is purchased from both internal and external sources 
in  approximately percent of northwest us and percent of new zealand log trading sales volume were sourced from company timberlands 
logs were also purchased from independent local dealers who  in some cases  had purchased cutting rights to company timberlands 
additionally  rayonier purchases lumber and wood panel products for sale in both domestic and export markets 
discontinued operations and dispositions during the second quarter of  the company sold its new zealand east coast timberland operations and associated assets for million 
the sale and results of operations were recorded as a discontinued operation in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income and the consolidated statements of cash flows and the related notes have been reclassified to present the east coast operations as a discontinued operation 
see also note sale of new zealand east coast timber operations 
prior years dispositions include rayonier s port angeles  wa performance fibers mill that was closed on february   its interest in the grays harbor  wa  performance fibers and paper complex  which was closed in  its wholly owned subsidiary  southern wood piedmont company swp  which ceased operations in  its eastern research division  which ceased operations in  and other miscellaneous assets held for disposition 
see also note reserves for dispositions and discontinued operations 
foreign sales and operations rayonier s sales for the three years ended december   by geographical destination are as follows in millions sales by destination united states europe japan china other asia latin america canada all other overseas assets  primarily in new zealand  were approximately percent of total assets at the end of  and rayonier s sales from non us operations were approximately percent of total sales 
see also note segment and geographical information 
patents rayonier has a number of patents and pending patent applications that relate to its proprietary products and processes 
the company intends to take such steps as are necessary to protect its patents and file applications for future inventions that are deemed important to its business operations 
competition and customers performance fibers are marketed worldwide against strong competition from domestic and foreign producers 
rayonier s major competitors include international paper  weyerhaeuser  georgia pacific and buckeye technologies 
recently  international paper announced the planned closure of its natchez  mississippi mill by the end of june this mill is a major competitor in the acetate market 
rayonier and the natchez mill are the leading suppliers in this market 
conversely  several foreign  low cost manufacturers of lower grade pulps are attempting to produce high grade acetate pulps and enter the market 
if successful  supply of these performance fibers grades may increase in the future  and with the overall demand growth being fairly modest  cellulose specialty margins may be affected 
on the other hand  the company continues to work towards development of new products and improvement in existing products and processes that could add additional value to the performance fibers business 
pricing  product performance and technical service are principal methods of competition 
the company s us timberlands are located in two major timber growing regions the northwest and the southeast  where timber markets are fragmented and competitive 
in the northwest us  the campbell group  john hancock mutual life insurance co  simpson timber company and washington state department of natural resources are significant competitors 
in the southeast us  the company competes with plum creek and international paper 
price is the principal method of competition 
rayonier s lumber and mdf wood products compete with construction materials manufactured by other companies 
continued improvements in operations at the company s mdf plant are offsetting a weaker us market  increased competition from south american suppliers and a reduced us demand for manufactured wood products from china which contain mdf 
export log markets are highly competitive 
logs are available from several countries and numerous suppliers 
in new zealand  major competitors include carter holt harvey and fletcher challenge 
price and customer relationships are important methods of competition 
the company did not have a single customer that purchased an amount greater than or equal to percent of its consolidated revenues during the years ended december   or on a segment basis  performance fibers sales included one customer that purchased an amount equal to percent of the segment s sales and four other customers that each purchased approximately percent of the segment s sales 
the loss of any one of these customers could have a material adverse effect on this segment s results of operations 
seasonality the company s timber and land segment normally experiences lower timber harvest volumes in the third quarter of each year due to the greater seasonal availability of non rayonier timber during the drier summer harvesting period  particularly in the northwestern us the wood products segment may experience higher seasonal demand in the volume of lumber sold in the second quarter of each year primarily due to the relative strength of housing starts 
the performance fibers segment results are normally not impacted by seasonal changes 
environmental matters see environmental regulation in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note contingencies 
raw materials in the us  timber availability continues to be restricted by legislation  litigation and pressure from various preservationist groups 
availability is also subject to cyclical swings in wood products as well as in pulp and paper markets and weather conditions 
rayonier has pursued  and is continuing to pursue  reductions in usage and costs of key raw materials  supplies and contract services at its performance fibers and lumber mills 
management foresees no significant constraints from pricing or availability of its key raw materials 
research and development rayonier believes it maintains one of the preeminent performance fibers research facilities and staff in the forest products industry 
research and development efforts are directed primarily at developing new and improved cellulose fiber grades and related products  improving manufacturing efficiency  reducing energy needs  improving product quality and developing improved environmental controls 
the research center is adjacent to the performance fibers mill in jesup  ga 
research activities related to timber operations include genetic tree improvement programs as well as applied silvicultural programs to identify management practices that improve financial returns from timber assets 
research and development annual expenditures were approximately million in both and  and million in employee relations rayonier currently employs approximately  people 
of this number  approximately  are employees in the united states  of whom percent are covered by labor contracts 
most hourly employees are represented by one of several labor unions 
labor relations are maintained in a normal and satisfactory manner 
in august and december  jesup s labor agreements  covering approximately employees  were extended through june  in april  fernandina s labor contracts  covering approximately employees  were extended through april  there were no changes to the jesup and fernandina labor contracts in rayonier has in effect various benefit plans for its employees and retirees  providing certain group medical  dental and life insurance coverage  pension and other benefits 
the cost of these plans is borne primarily by rayonier 
item properties rayonier owns  leases or controls approximately million acres of timberlands in the united states 
rayonier manages these properties and sells timber to other company operating units  as well as unaffiliated parties 
rayonier s new zealand subsidiary owns or manages the forest assets on approximately million acres of plantation forests in new zealand and australia 
rayonier and its wholly owned subsidiaries own or lease various other properties used in their operations 
these include two performance fibers mills  an engineered absorbent materials eam facility  three lumber manufacturing facilities  an mdf plant  a research facility and rayonier s corporate headquarters 
these facilities are located in the southeastern and northwestern portions of the us and in new zealand 
additional information on mill volumes is disclosed in item selected financial data 
item legal proceedings rayonier is engaged in various legal actions  including certain environmental proceedings that are discussed more fully in note reserves for dispositions and discontinued operations and note contingencies 
on february   the company received a notice of proposed disallowance from the internal revenue service irs for million in tax deficiency and related penalties for an issue in dispute regarding the company s and federal tax returns 
the company has been discussing this issue with the irs since as a result  the notice of proposed disallowance was not unanticipated and the company has provided adequate book reserves 
the company is contesting this matter and believes that the ultimate outcome will not have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position  liquidity or results of operations 
between and  the company sent contaminated soil excavated in connection with the cleanup of various closed wood processing sites to a third party processor for recycling 
the processing facility closed in and is the subject of a variety of environmental related charges brought by the us environmental protection agency epa and the louisiana department of environmental quality in june  in united states district court for the western district of louisiana 
also in dispute is disposal liability for approximately  tons of recycled material from company sites that are still owned and retained by the processor 
a consent decree was entered in approving sale of the processing facility and assumption by the buyer of responsibility for movement of all remaining recycled material to a landfill 
the parties were unable to complete the sale and the consent decree was vacated in may as a result  the status of the sale of the facility and ultimate responsibility for removal and disposal of the recycled material on site are now uncertain 
there are numerous possible outcomes that could determine the company s ultimate liability  if any 
the company believes that reserves at december  adequately reflect the probable costs to be incurred upon the ultimate resolution of the dispute 
see also note reserves for dispositions and discontinued operations 
in december  the united states commenced a lawsuit against the company in the united states district court for the western district of washington to recover approximately million in costs allegedly incurred by epa in to conduct an expanded site investigation at the company s port angeles mill site 
rayonier is challenging the epa s authority to recover this type of cost  as well as the validity of the amount spent 
the company believes that the ultimate outcome will not have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position  liquidity or results of operations

in rayonier s performance fibers segment  low demand caused commodity fluff pulp prices to decline steadily during in  prices remained low  but stable 
sales volumes of high value cellulose specialties pulp increased during the year due to strong demand  while prices remained relatively stable 
in the timber and land segment  timber volumes increased slightly in the northwest us and new zealand while they declined in the southeast us on average  timber prices declined in the us although they improved in new zealand 
in  the company continued its ongoing strategic land sales program to capture the appreciation of its timberland values on a more regular basis and to reduce debt 
timberland sales were lower in  principally due to a large tract of timberland sold in the second quarter of for million 
in the wood products segment  despite near record demand for lumber  prices declined due to overcapacity and higher imports 
at the company s medium density fiberboard mdf plant in new zealand  price realization improved due to a favorable mix  while volumes remained at the prior year level 
in  rayonier continued to focus its capital spending on cost reduction and quality and productivity improvements in its performance fibers segment 
in the timber and land segment  the company focused its capital spending on investment in reforestation and silvicultural projects for its timberland base 
these investments are expected to help moderate the cyclical effects of the performance fibers business  improve bottom of the cycle earnings and add value to existing assets 
for additional information regarding the company s capital expenditures  see liquidity and capital resources 
rayonier s results continue to be adversely affected by the recessionary global economy and low  but generally stable  product prices 
the company continues to experience strength in its high value cellulose specialties business and its timberland sales program 
on january   the company indicated that first quarter earnings were expected to be lower than both first quarter and fourth quarter earnings due to the timing of land sales and performance fibers shipments  weaker timber markets and increased raw material and energy costs 
meaningful earnings improvement over current levels is not expected until the economy recovers 
during  the company sold its new zealand east coast timberland operations  resulting in a loss on sale of million or per share  which is reflected as a discontinued operation in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 
the new zealand east coast income from discontinued operations of million or per share was reclassified to discontinued operations  resulting in a net loss from discontinued operations of million or per share 
east coast operating income for of million or per share and for of million or per share was also reclassified to discontinued operations 
results of operations  versus sales and operating income sales of billion and operating income of million in were million and million below sales and operating income  respectively 
lower sales and operating income in were a result of unfavorable absorbent materials prices and mix  lower land sales  weaker us timber prices and higher incentive compensation 
these items were partially offset by lower manufacturing costs in performance fibers  lumber and mdf 
performance fibers performance fibers sales of million were million below the prior year primarily due to lower absorbent materials prices  mainly fluff pulp and unfavorable cellulose specialties prices and mix  partially offset by higher cellulose specialties volume 
fluff pulp pricing is commodity in nature and generally moves in tandem with paper pulp market prices 
during  paper pulp and fluff pulp pricing declined significantly throughout the year 
these markets continued to decline during  although not as severely 
as a result  the company s average fluff pulp prices declined percent in compared to  while its average absorbent materials prices declined percent 
offsetting these price declines was a favorable mix change in the company s cellulose specialties volume  which increased percent 
this included a percent increase in acetate pulp volumes  an percent increase in ethers pulp volumes and a percent increase in high value specialty filter papers pulp volume 
despite the increase in volumes  average cellulose specialties prices declined percent in since  the company has improved its mix of cellulose specialties absorbent materials from a percent ratio to a percent ratio in operating income of million for the segment was essentially at the level as a result of unfavorable prices  offset by lower manufacturing costs and higher cellulose specialties volume 
timber and land timber and land sales of million were million below prior year and operating income of million was million below the prior year 
timber timber sales of million and operating income of million were each million below principally due to lower us timber prices 
in the southeast us  average pine timber prices declined percent due to an increasing supply of pine logs in the market 
in the northwest us  timber prices declined percent  as market demand for hemlock and douglas fir remained low compared to prior year levels 
these unfavorable variances were partially offset by a percent increase in radiata pine timber prices in new zealand due to the strong export lumber manufacturing customer base in the southland and west regions that the company supplies 
although delivered log sales did not significantly impact operations  log sales in are expected to increase 
land land sales of million were million below prior year with operating income of million decreasing million 
the operating income decline resulted from lower volume  as only  acres were sold in versus  acres in  which included a significant margin contribution from a major timberland sale  acres in the second quarter 
the company routinely sells between to percent of its timberland base each year in order to capture the appreciated value on a more regular basis 
wood products sales of million for this segment were million above prior year  while the operating loss of million was at the level 
lumber results were essentially at the prior year level with lower manufacturing costs offset by a percent decrease in average prices 
the usual cyclical improvement in lumber prices due to strong housing starts was not evident due to a surge in canadian lumber supply ahead of tariff increases and increased imports driven by the strong us dollar 
mdf results were also essentially at the prior year level  with a percent price appreciation due to mix offset by higher manufacturing costs 
in order to improve operating margins in these non core businesses  the company closed a lumber finishing operation resulting in a million impairment charge to reflect the estimated net realizable value of this asset now held for sale 
impairment testing on the remaining assets in this segment indicates that the net book value is recoverable from estimated future undiscounted cash flows 
the company does not have any immediate plans to exit these businesses 
other sales of all other operations of million were million above prior year  while the operating loss of million was million below the prior year loss 
in  trading margins improved based on higher sales compared to the company has consolidated certain operations in its non core businesses in order to improve operating margins but does not have immediate plans to exit these businesses 
provision for dispositions in  the disposition reserve for the closure of washington facilities including the port angeles  wa performance fiber mill was increased by million due to revised cost estimates to complete required remediation procedures 
no such adjustments were recorded in corporate and other corporate and other costs of million for were million lower than principally due to the favorable impact of balance sheet foreign exchange translation and lower reorganization costs  partially offset by higher incentive compensation 
rayonier purchases foreign currency forward contracts to offset the impact of new zealand us dollar exchange fluctuations on operating results 
upon purchase  the company prepares and accumulates the required formal documentation in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  and designates each new zealand dollar forward contract as a cash flow hedge of certain forecasted new zealand dollar denominated cash outflows 
at each reporting date thereafter  the contracts are marked to market and changes in the fair value of the forward contracts are deferred and recorded as part of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
when the forecasted transaction comes to fruition and is recorded in earnings  the gains or losses on the contracts are reclassified to the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income on the line entitled other operating income  net 
in  the company recorded a pre tax gain of million relating to the contracts versus a pre tax loss of million in in  the new zealand us dollar exchange rate increased from on january   to on december  for additional information relating to the company s new zealand forward contracts  see note financial instruments 
other income expense interest expense of million was million below the prior year principally due to lower debt  partially offset by higher tax deficiency interest accrued resulting from recent irs settlement proposals relating to outstanding tax audit issues 
during  rayonier reduced debt by million utilizing its strong operating cash flow and million in proceeds from the sale of its new zealand east coast operations 
interest and miscellaneous income of million was primarily interest income 
this was consistent with the amount in  as lower interest income in our performance fibers segment in was offset by interest income resulting from the new zealand east coast sale 
income taxes the effective tax rate for was percent compared to percent in the effective tax rates are below us statutory levels primarily due to lower rates in effect for foreign subsidiaries  export sales tax benefits  and research and development credits 
in  the appreciation of the new zealand dollar versus the us dollar and the realization of previously unrecognized foreign tax benefits resulted in an even lower effective tax rate

these unfavorable items were partially offset by higher cellulose specialties  lumber and timber volumes 
performance fibers performance fibers sales of million were million below the prior year  principally due to lower absorbent materials prices and volume  and slightly lower cellulose specialties prices partly offset by higher cellulose specialties volume 
average fluff pulp prices declined percent and percent for the fourth quarter and full year  respectively  compared to the same periods in average absorbent materials prices  which include fluff pulp prices  declined percent compared to fluff pulp prices are significantly impacted by the cyclical nature of commodity market paper pulp prices  which declined during as the sluggish economy caused demand to fall in that market 
however  due to the company s high value product mix  prices for the performance fibers segment tend to lag commodity paper pulp prices and its upturns and downturns are not as pronounced 
average cellulose specialties prices were only percent lower in  while volumes increased percent 
since  the company has improved its mix of cellulose specialties absorbent materials from a ratio to in operating income of million for the segment was million below  as a result of the lower prices and higher manufacturing costs  partially offset by the higher cellulose specialties volume 
timber and land timber and land sales of million were at the prior year level  while operating income of million was below the prior year by million 
timber timber sales of million and operating income of million in were million and million below prior year  respectively 
sales declined due to lower timber prices in all of the company s operating regions 
in the northwest us  average prices declined percent compared to  while in the southeast us average prices declined percent 
these price declines were partly offset by higher volumes 
in new zealand  average prices increased percent while volume declined percent 
land timberland sales of million and operating income of million were above by million and million  respectively 
the operating income improvement essentially results from a higher margin on a major timberland sale in the second quarter of compared to a first quarter major timberland sale  as well as an additional significant timberland sale in the fourth quarter of in  rayonier announced a program to routinely sell between percent to percent of its timberland base to capture its appreciated value annually 
in  the company sold approximately  acres  or percent of its timberland base 
in  it sold approximately  acres  or percent of its timberland base 
wood products sales of million were million above the prior year while an operating loss of million was favorable to by million 
lumber results improved from the prior year due to lower manufacturing costs and a percent increase in volume 
these improvements were partly offset by lower average lumber prices  which declined percent 
poor lumber market conditions  which deteriorated significantly during  carried over into  causing prices to decline in mdf results improved in compared to the prior year due to slightly higher prices and volume and lower manufacturing costs 
other sales of all other operations of million were million below the prior year while an operating loss of million was unfavorable to by million 
the log trading business results declined compared to due to lower volume and slightly lower prices 
corporate and other corporate and other costs of million for were million higher than principally due to higher stock price based incentive compensation and reorganization costs associated with the retirement of two senior executives 
other income expense interest expense of million was million below the prior year principally due to lower debt 
during  rayonier reduced debt by million 
other income in  primarily interest income  was million compared to million in the prior year amount includes a pre tax gain of million due to the sale of the company s interest in a new zealand joint venture 
this gain in was partially offset by an unfavorable impact from mark to market losses on foreign currency forward contracts prior to the adoption of sfas no 
income taxes the effective tax rate for was percent compared to percent in the effective tax rates are below us statutory levels  primarily due to the lower rates in effect for foreign subsidiaries  export sales tax benefits  research and development credits and a year end foreign currency related tax benefit adjustment 
the rate was below due to the reversal of tax provisions for items resolved as a result of the completion of several tax audits 
liquidity and capital resources cash provided by operating activities of million in increased million from this increase was a result of lower working capital requirements  including lower tax and interest payments  and million of pension contributions made in versus million in rayonier used this operating cash flow to reduce debt  finance capital expenditures of million  pay dividends of million  and repurchase million of its outstanding common shares 
during the year  the company paid off its remaining million of outstanding notes 
the year end debt to capital ratio of percent was percentage points lower than the percentage of debt with fixed interest rates was percent as of december   and percent as of december  on december   the company had cash investments of million  an increase of million from year end the cash investments consist of marketable securities with maturities at date of acquisition of days or less 
the severe decline in the us equity markets during reduced the value of the company s pension plan assets and lower interest rates have increased the net present value of projected benefit obligations 
at december   the company s pension plans were underfunded projected benefit obligation in excess of the fair market value of the plan assets by approximately million versus million at december  as a result  the company estimated that approximately million would be required to be contributed to the plan by september to meet the minimum requirements for the plan year  alternatively  to avoid additional funding charges the company elected to contribute million in january in addition to the pension contribution  the company anticipates increased cash outflows in related to potential irs audit settlements and environmental spending 
see note contingencies  and environmental regulation for further information 
cash provided by discontinued operations in of million includes the cash flows from operations of the company s new zealand east coast timber operations prior to its sale and proceeds from the sale of million 
at closing  the company received million in cash and a note receivable for million to be paid in monthly installments during  with a balloon payment due in december in october  the buyer prepaid the outstanding note receivable of million 
cash provided by operating activities of million in declined million from million in the decline was principally a result of lower income 
rayonier used this operating cash flow to reduce debt by million  finance capital expenditures of million  pay dividends of million and repurchase million of its outstanding common shares 
the year end debt to capital ratio of percent was percentage points lower than the percentage of debt with fixed interest rates was percent as of december   and percent as of december  the discussion below is presented to enhance the reader s understanding of rayonier s ability to generate cash  its liquidity and its ability to satisfy rating agency and creditor requirements 
this information includes two measures of financial results earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  and free cash flow 
these measures are not defined by generally accepted accounting principles gaap and the discussion of ebitda and free cash flow is not intended to conflict with or change any of the gaap disclosures described above 
management considers these measures to be important to estimate the enterprise and shareholder values of the company as a whole and of its core segments  and for allocating capital resources 
in addition  analysts  investors and creditors use these measures when analyzing the financial condition and cash generating ability of the company 
ebitda and free cash flow as defined may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
ebitda is defined as earnings from continuing operations before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation  depletion  amortization and the non cash cost of land sales 
ebitda is a non gaap measure of gross cash generating capacity of the company 
in  ebitda was million or per share  a decrease of million or per share from the decrease was primarily due to lower sales in the timber and land segment 
in  ebitda was million or per share  a decrease of million or per share from this decrease was primarily due to lower operating cash from the performance fibers segment and to a lesser degree from the timber and land segment 
below is a reconciliation of cash provided by operating activities to ebitda for the three year period ended december  in millions except per share amounts cash provided by operating activities add income tax expense interest expense working capital increases decreases other balance sheet increases decreases ebitda ebitda per share rayonier has revolving credit agreements with a group of banks that provide the company with unsecured credit facilities totaling million 
the revolving credit facilities are used for direct borrowings and in the past  as credit support for a commercial paper program 
in november  a million facility expired 
as of december   the company had million of available borrowings under its facility  which expires in november in addition  in connection with the financing of the smurfit timberland acquisition  rtoc entered into an agreement with a group of banks that provided rtoc with revolving credit facilities totaling million and a term loan of million  of which million was outstanding at december  as of december   rtoc had million of available borrowings under the revolving credit portion  which expires in in addition  the company has on file with the securities and exchange commission  a shelf registration statement to offer million of new public debt securities 
management believes that internally generated funds  combined with available external financing as described above  will enable rayonier to fund capital expenditures  dividends  share repurchases  working capital  and other liquidity needs for the foreseeable future 
in conjunction with the company s long term debt  certain covenant restrictions are required on the ratio of ebitda to consolidated interest expense and total debt to ebitda 
in addition  there are covenant requirements in effect for rtoc on the ratio of consolidated cash flow available for fixed charges to consolidated fixed charges and the ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated cash flow available for fixed charges 
the covenants listed below are calculated on a trailing month basis 
the most restrictive long term debt covenants in effect for rayonier as of december   were as follows covenant requirement actual ratio at december  favorable unfavorable ebitda to consolidated interest expense should not be less than to to total debt to ebitda should not exceed to to consolidated rtoc cash flow available for fixed charges to consolidated rtoc fixed charges should not be less than to to consolidated rtoc debt to consolidated rtoc cash flow available for fixed charges may not exceed to to in addition to the covenants listed above  the credit agreements include customary covenants that limit the incurrence of debt  the disposition of assets and the making of certain payments between rtoc and rayonier 
the company is currently in compliance with all of these covenants 
rayonier defines custodial capital spending as capital expenditures required to maintain its current earnings level over the cycle and to keep facilities and equipment in safe and reliable condition as well as in compliance with regulatory requirements 
in  capital expenditures of million included million of custodial capital spending  of which million was for environmental spending 
discretionary spending of million was for additions to the jesup packaging line automation and process efficiency projects  the novathin engineered absorbent materials facility  the baxley automated lumber handling system  and the swainsboro mill modifications 
rayonier expects to invest approximately million in capital projects for each of the two years ended and capital projects include profit improvement  custodial capital  timberlands reforestation and various projects to comply with new environmental laws and requirements 
as new environmental regulations are promulgated  additional capital spending may be required 
for additional information concerning environmental expenditures  see environmental regulation 
free cash flow is defined as cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations less net custodial capital spending  dividends at the prior year level and the tax benefit on the exercise of stock options 
free cash flow is a non gaap measure of discretionary cash available for capital expenditures  paying dividends above the prior year level  repurchasing the company s common shares and or reducing debt 
free cash flow of million in increased million from million in the increase primarily results from lower working capital requirements partially offset by higher custodial capital spending 
below is a reconciliation of cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow for the three year period ended december  in millions cash provided by operating activities custodial capital spending  net dividends at prior year level tax benefit on exercise of stock options free cash flow in  rayonier began a common share repurchase program to minimize the dilutive effect on earnings per share of its employee incentive stock plans 
this program limits the number of shares that may be repurchased each year to the greater of percent of our outstanding shares or the number of incentive shares actually issued to employees during the year 
in october  the board authorized the repurchase of an additional one million shares through december  and in october  the board increased the authorization by an additional one million shares 
these share repurchases were authorized separately from the percent of outstanding share anti dilutive program 
below is a table of share repurchases for the past three years shares repurchased    cost of repurchased shares in thousands    average cost per share in february  standard poor s revised its outlook on the company to stable from negative and re affirmed their triple b minus investment grade rating on the company s long term debt 
in addition  they withdrew their a short term debt rating on the company s commercial paper program at the company s request  as the program is currently inactive due to the focus on debt reduction 
moody s investment grade rating on the company is baa  with a stable outlook 
net debt is an additional non gaap measure that management uses as an indication of anticipated debt levels 
it is defined as total debt on a gaap basis less cash invested and intended for debt reduction 
at december  and  cash invested was million and million  respectively  resulting in net debt of million and million  respectively 
the company s net debt to capital ratios were percent and percent as of december  and  respectively 
contractual financial obligations and off balance sheet arrangements in addition to using cash flow from operations  the company finances its operations through the issuance of debt  and by entering into leases 
these financial obligations are recorded in accordance with accounting rules applicable to the underlying transaction  with the result that some are recorded as liabilities on the balance sheet  while others are required to be disclosed in the notes to consolidated financial statements and management s discussion and analysis 
the following table aggregates the company s contractual financial obligations and anticipated cash spending by period payments due by period contractual financial obligations s total thereafter current maturities of long term debt   long term debt    operating leases timberland    operating leases pp e  offices    capital leases purchase obligations   total contractual cash obligations    the nature and purpose of the company s off balance sheet arrangements are to provide credit support for certain creditors in case of default and collateral for certain self insurance programs that the company maintains 
these arrangements consist of standby letters of credit and surety bonds 
as part of its ongoing operations  the company may also periodically issue guarantees to third parties 
the company s off balance sheet arrangements are not considered to be a source of liquidity or capital resource for the company and do not expose the company to material risks or material unfavorable financial impacts 
the following table aggregates the company s financial commitments as of december  financial commitments s total amounts committed standby letters of credit  guarantees  surety bonds  total financial commitments  approximately million of the standby letters of credit serve as credit support for industrial revenue bonds 
the remaining letters of credit support various insurance coverages  primarily workers compensation and pollution requirements 
these letters of credit expire at various dates during and and are typically rolled over as required 
in conjunction with the sale of the new zealand east coast timber operations in  the company guaranteed five years of crown forest license obligations  estimated at million per year 
the buyer of the property is the primary obligor and has posted a performance bond with the new zealand government 
if the buyer fails to pay the obligations  the company would then have to perform under the guarantee and seek legal redress from the buyer 
this guarantee expires in the company has issued surety bonds primarily to secure timber in the state of washington as well as providing collateral for the company s workers compensation self insurance program in that state 
these surety bonds expire at various dates during and and are renewed as required 
critical accounting policies the preparation of rayonier s financial statements requires the company to make estimates  assumptions and judgements that affect the assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities reported in this annual report on form k 
the company bases these estimates and assumptions on historical data and trends  current fact patterns  expectations and other sources of information it believes are reasonable 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different conditions 
merchantable inventory and depletion costs as determined by forestry timber harvest models significant assumptions and estimations are used in the recording of timberland inventory cost and depletion 
rayonier employs a forestry technical services group at each of its timberland management locations 
merchantable standing timber inventory is estimated annually  using industry standard computer software 
the inventory calculation takes into account growth  in growth annual transfer of oldest pre merchantable age class into the merchantable inventory  timberland sales and the annual harvest specific to each business unit 
an annual business unit depletion rate is established by dividing merchantable inventory book cost by standing merchantable inventory 
pre merchantable records are maintained for each planted year age class  recording acres planted  stems per acre  and costs of planting and tending 
changes in the assumptions and or estimations used in these calculations may affect the company s results  in particular  timber inventory and depletion costs 
a three percent change in actual versus estimated standing merchantable inventory would cause depletion to change by approximately million 
depreciation of long lived assets as specifically affected by economic obsolescence the company computes depreciation expense using the units of production method on its performance fibers and mdf production plant and equipment and the straight line method on all other property  plant and equipment over the useful economic lives of the assets involved 
management believes these depreciation methods are the most appropriate under the circumstances as they more closely match revenues with expenses versus other generally accepted accounting methods 
long lived assets are periodically reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the physical life of equipment  however  may be shortened by economic obsolescence caused by environmental regulation  competition and other causes 
environmental costs associated with dispositions and discontinued operations rayonier has significant liabilities accrued for environmental costs relating to past dispositions and discontinued operations that will be spent over the next to years 
significant estimates are used in determining the proper value of these obligations at a given point in time  especially due to the long term nature of the obligations 
typically these cost estimates do not vary significantly on a quarter to quarter basis 
factors affecting these estimates include  but are not limited to  technological and regulatory changes  results from on going work and management s judgement 
management periodically reviews the company s environmental liabilities for technological and regulatory changes and also engages consultants to assess the extent of additional work required 
a material change in an estimate in any given period could have a favorable or unfavorable effect on the results of the company s operations 
in  reserves were increased by million for revised estimates of remediation costs required at the company s closed washington sites  including its port angeles mill 
expenditures for all such environmental costs totaled million in and are expected to increase to million in primarily as a result of the increased spending required at the company s washington state and southern wood piedmont sites 
the company expects annual expenditures in and future years to return to the million to million range 
determining the adequacy of pension assets and liabilities the company maintains four qualified benefit plans which cover substantially all of the company s us workforce and an unfunded plan to provide benefits in excess of amounts allowable under current tax law to participants in the qualified plans 
pension expense for all plans was million in numerous estimates and assumptions are required to determine the proper amount of pension and postretirement liabilities and annual expense to record in the company s financial statements 
the key assumptions include discount rate  return on assets  salary increases  health care cost trends  longevity and service lives of employees 
although there is authoritative guidance on how to select these assumptions  the company s management and its actuaries exercise some degree of judgement when selecting these assumptions 
selecting different assumptions  as well as actual versus expected results  would change the net periodic benefit cost and funded status of the benefit plans recognized in the financial statements 
in determining pension expense of million in  a million return on pension assets was assumed  based on an expected long term rate of return of percent  versus an actual loss of million 
this long term return assumption calculated using geometric compound averaging was established based on historical long term rates of return on broad equity and bond indices  discussions with the company s actuaries and investment advisors and consideration of the actual annualized rate of return of percent through since the spin off from itt corporation 
with the recent decline in equity markets the company has reduced its long term rate of return assumption to percent  effective january  management will review this assumption periodically to ensure it remains reasonable 
at december  the company s asset mix consisted of percent equities and percent bonds 
the company does not expect this mix to materially change in the future 
in determining its future pension obligations  the company selects a discount rate based on rates supplied by its actuaries who incorporate high quality aa rated  long term corporate bond rates into their models 
the discount rate at december  of percent declined from the december  rate of percent 
as a result of reducing the long term expected rate of return and the discount rate and considering the unrecognized actuarial losses of million  the company expects its pension expense to increase million to million from the million recorded in future pension expense will be impacted by many factors including actual investment performance  changes in discount rates and other employee related matters 
if a long term return on plan assets of percent the current assumption had been used at the beginning of and all other assumptions remained constant  pension expense would have increased by about million 
if a discount rate of percent the current assumption had been used to calculate december  pension obligations and all other assumptions remained constant  our pension expense would have increased by approximately million 
the company estimated that contributions of approximately million would be required by september for the company to meet minimum requirements for the plan year  alternatively  to avoid additional funding charges the company contributed million in january although future funding requirements will vary depending on actual investment performance  changes in discount rates and other employee related matters  the company does not anticipate additional cash contributions will be required for the remainder of realizability of both recorded and unrecorded tax assets and liabilities the company has recorded certain deferred tax assets that management believes will be realized in future periods 
these assets are reviewed periodically in order to assess their realizability 
this review requires management to make assumptions and estimates about future profitability affecting the realization of these tax benefits 
if the review indicated that the realizability may be less than likely  a valuation allowance would be made at that time 
in addition  the company has not provided for taxes on approximately million of undistributed foreign earnings as the company intends to reinvest such earnings in the future 
this assumption is reviewed periodically to ensure that any changes in the company s ability and intent to reinvest these earnings will be properly disclosed and accounted for 
these additional foreign earnings could become subject to additional tax if remitted  or deemed remitted  as a dividend 
however  the additional amount of taxes payable is not practicable to estimate 
new accounting standards in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this statement requires entities to record the cost of any legal obligation for the retirement of a tangible long lived asset in the period in which it is incurred

the statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and the company adopted it effective january  in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 recission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
as allowed by the fasb  the company early adopted the standard on april  during  the company refinanced million of its revenue bonds 
in accordance with the standard  the write off of the balance of the deferred financing fees of million and the premium of million paid upon the redemption of the original bonds were not classified as an extraordinary item in the company s consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this statement nullifies emerging issues task force eitf no 
and requires that a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized only when the liability is incurred 
sfas no 
is effective for exit and disposal activities that are initiated after december  the company adopted the standard effective january  and does not expect it to have a material impact on earnings 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
this interpretation addresses the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under guarantees 
in addition  the interpretation clarifies the requirements related to the recognition of a liability by a guarantor at the inception of a guarantee for the obligations that the guarantor has undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the company adopted the disclosure requirements of fin for the fiscal year ended december   and the recognition provisions on january  in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
this standard amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this standard amends the disclosure requirements in both annual and interim financial statements related to the methods of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method on reported results 
the standard also prohibits the use of the prospective method of transition  as outlined in sfas no 
 if options are to be expensed when changing to the fair value based method in fiscal years beginning after december  the company adopted the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
on december  in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
this interpretation applies to variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
it applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june   to variable interest entities in which an enterprise held a variable interest that it acquired on or before january  the company will adopt this interpretation as of july  the company believes it does not have any variable interests that constitute a majority variable interest requiring consolidation  and as a result  there will be no impact on its financial condition or results of operations 
environmental regulation rayonier is subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations concerning air emissions  water discharges and waste disposal 
such environmental laws and regulations include the federal clean air act  the clean water act  the resource conservation and recovery act  and the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act 
management closely monitors all of its environmental responsibilities  together with trends in environmental laws and believes that the company is in substantial compliance with current environmental requirements 
it is the opinion of management that substantial expenditures over the next years will be required in the area of environmental compliance 
during  and  rayonier spent approximately million  million and million  respectively  for capital projects related to environmental compliance for ongoing operations 
during  rayonier expects to spend approximately million on such capital projects 
the environmental protection agency epa finalized its cluster rules governing air emissions in but  due to the specialty nature of rayonier s performance fibers products and operations  the agency postponed finalizing water discharge rules and certain air emissions rules governing the company s performance fibers mills 
rayonier continues to work with the epa to establish such rules for its mills  but the timing and costs associated with such rulemaking are uncertain 
in the opinion of management  capital costs to be incurred over the next five years associated with cluster rule compliance and other environmental regulations are not expected to exceed million at the performance fibers mills 
such capital expenditures are not expected to cause the company in total to exceed an annual average of million to million 
federal  state and local laws and regulations intended to protect threatened and endangered species  as well as wetlands and waterways  limit and may prevent timber harvesting  road building and other activities on private lands  including a portion of the company s timberlands 
over the past several years  the harvest of timber from the company s timberlands in the state of washington has been restricted as a result of the listing of the northern spotted owl  the marbled murrelet and several species of salmon and trout as threatened species under the endangered species act 
in  the timber industry and federal  state  local and tribal governments  entered into an agreement  known as the forests and fish report 
the washington forest practices board has adopted rules implementing the forests and fish report that further restrict timber harvesting within buffers along streams with fish habitat 
all of these restrictions have caused rayonier to restructure and reschedule some harvest plans and have reduced the total acreage and volume of timber available for harvest 
however  these restrictions have not had a material impact on rayonier s annual harvest volumes  and rayonier has made changes to its long term harvest plan to compensate for these restrictions 
rayonier currently estimates that expenditures during for environmental remediation and monitoring costs for all dispositions and discontinued operations will total approximately million 
such costs  including monitoring and remediation costs  will be charged against our reserves for estimated environmental obligations which the company believes are sufficient for costs expected to be incurred over the next to years with respect to dispositions and discontinued operations 
at december   these reserves totaled approximately million 
the actual future environmental costs will be dependent on the outcome of site evaluations and negotiations with federal and state agencies and may also be affected by new laws  regulations and administrative interpretations  and changes in environmental remediation technology 
based on information currently available  management does not believe that any future changes in estimates would materially affect rayonier s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market and other economic risks rayonier is exposed to various market risks  including changes in commodity prices  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company s intent is to minimize the economic impact of these market risks 
derivatives are used  as noted below  in accordance with policies and procedures approved by the board of directors and are managed by a senior executive committee whose responsibilities include initiating  managing and monitoring resulting exposures 
rayonier does not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
cyclical pricing of commodity market paper pulp ultimately influences performance fibers prices  particularly in the company s absorbent materials product line 
however  since rayonier is a non integrated producer of specialized performance fibers for non papermaking end uses  its high value product mix tends to lag on both the upturn and downturn commodity paper pulp prices and its peaks and valleys are less severe 
most of rayonier s revenues and expenses are us dollar denominated 
however  the company does have some risk within its new zealand operation related to foreign currency pricing and costs and periodically enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the risks of foreign currency fluctuations 
at december   the company held foreign currency contracts maturing through january totaling million 
the fair value of outstanding foreign currency contracts at year end was an asset of approximately million 
market risk resulting from a hypothetical cent change in the new zealand dollar us dollar exchange rate amounts to an approximate change of million in pre tax income loss 
rayonier periodically enters into interest rate swap agreements to manage its exposure to interest rate changes  or in back to back arrangements at the time debt is issued in order to cost effectively place the debt 
these swaps involve the exchange of fixed and variable interest rate payments without exchanging principal amounts 
at december   the company had one interest rate swap agreement in existence with a notional amount of million that swapped a fixed percent interest rate for six month libor rate plus percent 
the fair value of this interest rate swap at year end  which matures in  was an asset of million 
market risk resulting from a one percentage point basis points change in the six month libor rate amounts to an approximate change of million in pre tax income loss 
the fair market value of long term fixed interest rate debt is also subject to interest rate risk  however  rayonier intends to hold most of its debt until maturity 
occasionally  callable bonds will be refinanced at the company s option if favorable economic conditions exist 
generally  the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
the estimated fair value of our fixed rate debt at december   was million compared to million in carrying value 
a hypothetical one percentage point increase decrease in prevailing interest rates at december   would result in a corresponding decrease increase in the fair value of our fixed rate debt of approximately million 
the company periodically enters into commodity forward contracts to fix certain energy costs 
the forward contracts effectively eliminate the risk of a change in performance fibers margins resulting from an increase or decrease in fuel oil costs
