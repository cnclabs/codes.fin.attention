current business overview the office furniture industry has experienced about a decline in shipments over the past two years in the united states  as reported by the business and institutional furniture manufacturer s association international bifma  primarily caused by reduced business capital spending 
we implemented specific financial strategies to manage through the industry downturn aimed at reducing our breakeven point  improving our cash flow and strengthening our balance sheet 
we implemented several operational  organizational and financial restructuring activities in including lowered fixed and variable costs through actions which included reducing our global workforce approximately for the year and approximately since 
sold million of leased assets for proceeds of million 
reduced capital expenditures by focusing on shorter payback projects 
consolidated manufacturing operations to reduce excess capacity 
outsourced certain non core manufacturing operations and other activities 
closed or divested certain non strategic operations not meeting financial return targets 
sold certain non strategic and redundant fixed assets 
continued implementation of lean principles in our manufacturing operations 
leveraged investments in enterprise resource planning erp software systems to integrate order fulfillment processes 
launched new user centered products 
because sales volume fell faster than we could capture the benefits from the actions listed above  we reported a loss for however  because of these actions our quarterly breakeven revenue is approximately lower than it was almost two years ago at a level of approximately million  and we earned a profit in q cash flow from operating and investing activities improved as we sold leased assets and controlled capital expenditures 
we used our improved cash flow to strengthen our balance sheet 
we increased our cash balance while reducing debt to its lowest level in nearly four years

overview despite an additional shipping week during the fourth quarter  revenue declined in compared to following a decline of from to our polyvision corporation and custom cable industries acquisitions  both completed in the second half of fiscal  contributed million to our total revenue in the dealer acquisition completed during contributed million to our total revenue 
fiscal revenue was a record  million and reflected the impact of acquisitions and growth across most business segments  product categories and geographies 
we took aggressive steps to reduce costs  which helped to limit our losses in including non recurring items  we lowered total costs from levels and from to the actions we took to reduce costs in included a reduction in workforce or approximately  temporary  part time and full time hourly and salaried positions  reduced spending on items such as capital  travel and outside services  and facility rationalizations and process reengineering 
lower profits led to lower variable compensation  including reduced bonuses and retirement contributions 
we recorded a net operating charge for non recurring items  including charges for workforce reductions and restructuring  totaling million pre tax in compared to million in and million in 
table of contents non recurring charges in consisted of million in severance charges for north america and sdp workforce reductions completed or underway  a million charge for business exit costs  million for international restructuring and severance costs  offset by a million curtailment gain related to our post retirement medical and pension benefit plans 
see further discussion of non recurring items in the segment disclosure analysis below 
despite significant cost reduction actions undertaken in  the impact of lower revenue on fixed cost absorption and non recurring items caused operating margins to decline and resulted in us reporting a net loss of million before the cumulative effect of accounting change 
beginning in  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires companies to discontinue amortizing goodwill and test goodwill annually to determine whether it is impaired 
at the beginning of the first quarter  we recorded a non cash charge of million related to impairment of goodwill in the international segment 
at year end  we recorded a correction of the original calculation resulting in a revised first quarter charge of million 
see further discussion in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
the sfas no 
adoption charge had no effect on revenue  operating income  cash flow or income tax expense  thus the pre tax and after tax effect of the cumulative effect of the accounting change was the same

interest expense related to the financial services debt is recorded as an operating expense 
interest expense related to the debt attributed to the manufacturing portion of our business is recorded as a non operating expense and is shown above 
accordingly  non operating interest expense was not affected by the significant decrease in financial services debt in debt related to the manufacturing portion of our business remained fairly stable during  thus  non operating interest expense was comparable 
table of contents to interest expense in increased from due to an increase in our operating business debt  primarily from increased borrowings related to acquisitions in interest income declined in due to lower average investments outstanding and lower average interest rates 
losses on dealer transitions relate to uncollectible funds loaned to dealers to finance ownership changes 
during  we recognized losses on dealer transitions primarily related to two international dealers that have been significantly affected by the office furniture recession in their markets 
we are working with these dealers to restructure their business and improve their performance 
these losses do not include write offs of receivables that have arisen as a result of product sales 
charges for write offs associated with trade receivables from these affiliates are recorded as operating expenses 
during and  we recognized losses on dealer transitions primarily related to two north america dealers whose operating results deteriorated due to a significant decline in business activity in their local market and several other performance issues 
as a result  these dealers were restructured and ownership was transitioned to new dealer principals 
we carefully monitor the financial condition of dealers in ownership transition 
most of the dealers that have transition financing from steelcase have successfully reduced costs and taken other steps to manage through the downturn 
some individual dealers are facing difficult financial challenges 
we believe our reserves adequately reflect these credit risks 
however  if these dealers experience prolonged or deepening reduction in revenues  the likelihood of losses would increase and we would record additional charges or reserves  as necessary 
the non recurring gain on the disposal of property and equipment primarily related to the sale of our tustin  california manufacturing facility following the relocation of the operations to a smaller  more efficient facility 
we received net proceeds of million and recorded a gain of million 
in  we generated a gain of million on disposal of property and equipment  which was primarily related to the sale of two non income producing real estate assets 
our income tax expense is a function of actual taxable income earned by the company in different countries  the tax rates in various countries and tax planning strategies we implement 
we expect these strategies to result in a long term effective tax rate of between and 
because of our reduced tax liability  resulting from our lower pre tax income and consistent level of permanent tax items  our effective tax rate in was not meaningful

certain tables included in this section contain various non gaap generally accepted accounting principles financial measures 
a non gaap financial measure is defined as a numerical measure of a 
table of contents company s financial performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different than the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap in the consolidated statements of income  balance sheets or statements of cash flows of the company 
pursuant to the requirements of regulation g  each non gaap measure those measures excluding non recurring items is immediately preceded with the most directly comparable gaap measure  and the difference in all cases is the exclusion of items the company considers non recurring due to their nature  size or infrequency 
those items included as non recurring are identified in the discussion following each table 
each non gaap financial measure is presented because we monitor our business operations using this information  based on our belief that it provides an important insight into operating results and trends 
north america year ended income statement data north america february  february  february  in millions revenue gross profit percentage gross profit percentage  excluding non recurring items operating expenses operating expenses  excluding non recurring items operating expense percentage operating expense percentage  excluding non recurring items operating income loss operating income  excluding non recurring items operating income loss percentage operating income percentage  excluding non recurring items despite an additional shipping week during the fourth quarter  revenue in declined more than in the north america segment following about a decline from to  and reflecting a sharper decline than in any of our other manufacturing segments 
north america s largest customers dramatically reduced business capital spending during the past two years  resulting in a decline in revenue in seven of the last eight quarters  reaching its lowest level in q the decline in gross margins was primarily due to the following factors underabsorption of fixed overhead related to excess plant capacity 
inefficiencies resulting from operating individual plants at less than capacity 
as volume declined during the year  north america took additional steps to reduce cost of goods sold 
north america reduced hourly and salaried manufacturing workforce  rationalized and consolidated facilities  continued to implement lean manufacturing and captured savings from strategic sourcing initiatives 
however  the benefits 
table of contents from these actions did not fully offset the underabsorption of fixed manufacturing overhead 
overhead costs  such as depreciation  utilities  maintenance and other fixed costs  do not vary directly with revenue and cannot be reduced quickly 
in addition  when plants operate far below their capacity  indirect labor activities  such as material handling  inventory management and general supervision  may increase as a percentage of revenue 
north america is taking steps to further rationalize and consolidate operations to improve efficiency 
for example  in q we began consolidating two grand rapids  michigan plants  which we expect to complete in fiscal non recurring items included within cost of goods sold totaled a net gain of million 
this amount primarily consisted of workforce severance costs of million netted against post retirement medical and pension benefits curtailment gains of million 
operating expenses decreased almost since this decrease is a result of salaried workforce reductions  restructuring activities and reductions in discretionary and external spending  including elimination of all bonuses and reduction of retirement contributions 
non recurring items included within operating expenses totaled a net charge of million 
this amount primarily consisted of severance and workforce reduction costs of million offset by a gain of million for post retirement medical and pension benefits curtailment 
we maintain loss reserves related to dealer trade receivables  and we carefully monitor the financial condition of these dealers 
generally  steelcase dealers in north america have successfully reduced costs and taken other steps to manage through the downturn 
we have processes that allow us to monitor and react quickly to changes in credit quality of our dealers 
we believe our reserves adequately reflect these credit risks 
however  if these dealers experience a prolonged or deepening reduction in revenues  the likelihood of losses would increase and additional charges or reserves would be necessary

table of contents despite an additional shipping week during the fourth quarter  revenue for our sdp segment declined almost in following a nearly decline in the shutdown of an under performing business in this segment accounted for million of the revenue decline from to for the two year period  excluding the revenue of the shutdown business  the decline for sdp was approximately and was less than our consolidated decline of nearly 
sdp revenue is generally less dependent on large project orders and is less affected by declines in business capital spending due to its differentiated  design oriented product portfolio and focus on niche applications 
sdp margins are higher than our other manufacturing segments margins 
margins were relatively stable over the past two years because the cost structure of the sdp companies adjusts more quickly to changes in demand given their higher variable costs and lower fixed costs 
accordingly  the significant decline in revenue had less impact on sdp s fixed cost absorption 
margins in were approximately  excluding the shutdown business s negative gross margin of million 
despite salaried workforce reductions of approximately in the past two years  as well as other cost reduction efforts  operating expenses increased as a percentage of revenue 
essentially  revenue declined faster than the reduction in fixed costs 
operating expenses included non recurring charges of million in and million in related to workforce reductions 
sdp initiatives completed during to reduce costs included the merging of designtex and jm lynne into one company now referred to as the designtex group 
duplicated selling  administrative and distribution processes  as well as excess facilities  were consolidated  streamlined and or eliminated 
the consolidation of brayton s manufacturing operations from four facilities into one 
the relocation of metropolitan furniture s operations to a new  lower cost leased facility

table of contents international revenue declined over in each of the past two years due to the global nature of the economic recession 
while the timing of the recession varied from market to market  all of our major markets were affected 
revenue for our international segment hit its lowest point in q with sequential quarter improvements throughout subsequent quarters  partially attributable to the translation effect of the strengthening of the euro versus the us dollar in the latter half of following the initial volume driven decline in gross margins in  international gross margins remained relatively flat in for the following reasons international implemented social plans and workforce reduction efforts launched in  which resulted in a reduction of manufacturing related workers over the last two years 
international completed the divestiture of two under performing businesses in q  both of which generated negative margins in international implemented additional cost reduction efforts and continued to pursue lean manufacturing initiatives 
the decline in gross margins from to was primarily related to underabsorption of overhead due to the decrease in revenue 
included in cost of sales were non recurring restructuring charges for workforce reductions and asset impairments of million in and million in compared to  operating expenses decreased both in absolute terms and as a percent of revenue during the decrease can be attributed to a million reduction in charges related to dealer credit issues  a million reduction in amortization expense due to the change in accounting for goodwill  and cost reductions related to restructuring activities completed during and  including workforce reductions 
operating expenses included non recurring restructuring charges of million in and million in for workforce reductions and the impairment of assets to be sold 
economic conditions in certain countries continue to put pressure on some of our dealers 
we continue to carefully monitor the financial condition of dealers for changes in credit quality 
we believe our reserves adequately reflect these credit risks 
however  if dealers experience a prolonged or deepening reduction in revenues  the likelihood of losses would increase and additional charges or reserves would be necessary 

table of contents financial services year ended income statement data financial services february  february  february in millions revenue net financing margin general and administrative expenses non recurring items operating income loss beginning in q  we will adopt a new strategy for financial services in which we continue to originate leases for customers and will earn an origination fee for that service  but use a third party to provide lease funding 
as a result  we will no longer have credit or residual risk related to those leases 
as we were developing this new funding strategy during  we sold a substantial portion of our lease portfolio with a book value of million for proceeds of million 
after settling interest rate hedges related to these leases and transaction costs  we recorded a net gain of million 
as a result of the sale of these leased assets and a decline in leasing activity due to the overall industry recession  revenue declined in the decline in revenue and increases in lease credit reserves resulted in a million decline in financial services operating income in  including non recurring severance charges of million 
the remaining leases  with a gross receivable value of million  fall into four different categories 
the leases in each category are collateralized by the related furniture 
the first category includes leases that may be sold in the coming year 
the second category includes leases with credit qualities that have fallen since they were first originated 
we do not believe we can sell the leases in this category economically 
these lease customers are current on payments and we expect to work these balances down over time 
the third category includes leases that are less marketable because they include service contracts and will likely be held to the end of the lease term 
finally  the fourth category includes leases with a net investment value of million which are not current because these customers are experiencing financial difficulty 
reserves against the lease portfolio totaled million at february   million at february  and million at february  we continue to monitor all four categories of leases and we believe our reserves adequately reflect the current credit risk 
our ten largest lease customers make up million of gross lease receivables 
if financial services was to experience further defaults related to larger leases  it is likely significant increases in reserves would be necessary 
see notes and of the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding financial services activity 
see note for discussion of concentration of credit risk related to the financial services segment 

table of contents in the future  financial services will no longer be reported as a separate segment since its results and asset base are below the threshold requirements 
in future filings  financial services will be included with the other category 
other year ended income statement data other february  february  february  in millions revenue operating loss operating loss  excluding non recurring items as mentioned in part i item  our other category includes the operating companies of polyvision  ideo and attwood and miscellaneous revenue and expenses from unallocated corporate expenses and ventures 
the operating companies contributed revenue of million in  million in and million in the significant increase from to was largely due to the acquisition of polyvision in late the operating companies generated operating income totaling in  in and million in the significant increase from to primarily related to improved results reported by ideo 
the decrease in operating income of the companies from to was primarily related to decreased volume 
more than of corporate expenses which represent shared services are charged to the operating segments as part of a corporate allocation 
the unallocated portion of these expenses is considered general corporate costs and is reported within the other category 
revenue and costs of exploring new business opportunities within new market niches or areas related to  but not part of  our core business activities are considered ventures  and are reported in the other category 
net non recurring items totaling million were included in results and primarily consist of million of business exit costs related to a venture 
in  non recurring charges were million for workforce reductions 
liquidity and capital resources we generated positive cash flow from both operating and investing activities in as of february   our financial position included cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
these funds  in addition to cash generated from future operations  lease sales and available and future credit facilities  are expected to be sufficient to finance our known or foreseeable liquidity and capital needs 
total consolidated debt as of february  was million  consisting of million that related to our financial services segment and million that related to our other business segments 
our consolidated debt to capital ratio was at year end 
total debt as of february  was million

we have not accessed the commercial market since may and no longer maintain a short term rating 
we allowed the day million tranche of the bank facility to expire in april and expect to replace the remaining year tranche with a new facility by june we expect the new facility to be sized between million 
certain of our financing and lease facilities require us to satisfy financial covenants including a minimum net worth covenant  a maximum debt ratio covenant  and a minimum interest coverage ratio covenant 
as a result of the correction of the goodwill impairment charge  as discussed earlier  we were not in compliance with the minimum net worth covenant as of february  this affected our global bank facility  our two term facilities and  through a cross default provision  our aircraft operating lease 
there was million in obligations under the affected facilities  including under the two term facilities and million under the aircraft operating lease 
there were no obligations outstanding under the global bank facility 
the global bank facility lenders approved a waiver of that covenant through june  at which time we expect to have our new facility in place 
this waiver automatically remedied the non compliance with the aircraft lease 
we secured a waiver and an amendment of the affected covenant related to the two term facilities 
the company has commitments related to certain sales offices  showrooms  and equipment under non cancelable operating leases that expire at various dates through minimum payments for operating 
table of contents leases having initial or remaining non cancelable terms in excess of one year are presented in the contractual obligation table below 
the aircraft lease is a synthetic lease structure that was put in place in may the synthetic lease structure provides us with access to funding through a commercial paper facility 
for accounting purposes  we have classified the lease as an operating lease and minimum future payments of million with respect to this lease are included in the contractual obligations table below 
the remaining lease balance including residuals is million 
under fasb interpretation fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  it is reasonably likely that the lessor will be consolidated in our consolidated balance sheet at the end of q the aircraft will be capitalized as part of our assets and related lease balance will be recorded as our debt

table of contents although there was a year to year decline in net income before the cumulative effect of the accounting change  most of the year to year change in cash generated from operating activities is reflected in changes in operating assets and liabilities 
in  operating assets less operating liabilities decreased by million 
the dramatic reduction in revenue from q to q drove a similar decline in receivables  inventories and payables  which is reflected in this line 
in  the reduction in revenue was not as dramatic  and we saw a relatively small decline in receivables and inventories  net of payables  before translation adjustments 
however  there was a substantial net increase in other operating assets  net of other operating liabilities 
this increase was caused by a curtailment of the post retirement medical and pension benefit plans and reductions in other employee benefit liabilities related to reduction in force 
we also used cash during for restructuring costs that had been accrued during the reduction in cash reflected in other  net relates to an increase in deferred taxes because of deferred taxable losses on leased asset sales and an increase in foreign tax loss carryforwards 
the other  net reduction in cash was net of addbacks related to non cash losses and write offs related to asset dispositions included in net income in that year

we reduced capital expenditures approximately in following an approximate reduction in the significant reductions in capital spending over the past two years reflect an emphasis on limiting new projects to those that meet key eva milestones and deliver short payback cost savings or support critical 
table of contents strategic initiatives such as product development 
at the end of  our committed capital expenditures totaled million and related to numerous equipment  facility and software projects 
the primary use of cash in investing activities during was for strategic acquisitions and capital expenditures 
acquisitions included polyvision corporation  custom cable inc and steelcase artwright manufacturing 
we experienced a substantial decrease in dealer notes receivable during dealers required less working capital because of the downturn in the furniture industry 
in  we had significant proceeds from the disposal and sale leaseback of fixed assets  which were partially offset by increased capital expenditures 
during  we generated incremental cash by financing certain non income producing assets through the use of several sale leaseback arrangements 
in addition  we sold other non income producing assets during the year 
cash provided by used in financing activities year ended cash flow data financing activities february  february  february  in millions short term and long term debt  net dividends paid common stock issuance repurchase  net net cash used in financing activities over the past two years  one of our focus points was strengthening our balance sheet 
one way we accomplished this was by reducing debt through the cash generated from operating and investing activities 
we paid common stock dividends of per share in  per share in  and per share in the dividend rate declared by the board of directors was per share in each quarter of we issued common stock in for proceeds of million related to the exercise of employee stock options

table of contents the board of directors has authorized share repurchases of up to million shares 
we did not repurchase any common shares during approximately million shares remain available for repurchase under the program and we have no outstanding share repurchase commitments 
since the inception of our repurchase program  million shares have been repurchased for million 
the reduction in share repurchase activity since is due in part to a shift towards using excess cash to reduce debt  particularly during the economic downturn 
currently  about of our common shares are class a tradable compared to at the time of our initial public offering in february we do not expect share repurchases to reduce our tradable share float in the long run since we anticipate class b common stock to gradually convert to class a common stock over time 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition is based upon our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
the company s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and related notes 
although these estimates are based on historical data and management s knowledge of current events and actions it may undertake in the future  actual results may differ from the estimates if different conditions occur 
the accounting policies that typically involve a higher degree of judgments  estimates and complexity are listed and explained below 
revenue recognition revenue consists substantially of product sales and related service revenues as well as finance revenue associated with our financial services segment 
product sales are recognized when the product ships 
typically  this is when title and risks associated with ownership have passed 
title passes on delivery  rather than shipment  for less than of product sales 
this exception does not have a significant effect on annual revenues or net income 
service revenue is not material 
finance revenue consists of interest income from dealer financing and leasing revenue 
interest income is recognized at established interest rates as earned over time 
direct finance lease revenue includes interest earned on the net investments in leased assets  which is recognized over the lease term as a constant percentage return 
operating lease revenue is recognized as income as payments are scheduled to be received over the lease term 
the recognition of finance revenue is discontinued when  in the opinion of management  the borrower will be unable to meet their scheduled repayments 

table of contents allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses is maintained at a level considered by management to be adequate to absorb an estimate of probable future losses existing at the balance sheet date 
in estimating probable losses  we review accounts that are past due  non performing  or in bankruptcy 
we also review accounts that may have higher credit risk using information available about the customer  such as financial statements  news reports  and published credit ratings 
we also use general information regarding industry trends  the general economic environment and information gathered through our network of field based employees 
using an estimate of current fair market value of the collateral and other credit enhancements  such as third party guarantees  we arrive at an estimated loss for specific accounts and estimate an additional amount for the remainder of the portfolio based on historical trends 
this process is based on estimates  and ultimate losses may differ from those estimates 
uncollectible receivable balances are written off when we determine that the balance is uncollectible 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance when received 
long lived assets we periodically review the carrying value of our long lived assets held and used and assets to be disposed of 
this review is performed using estimates of future cash flows and or a market value approach 
if the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired  an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
residual values for lease receivables residual value is an estimate at the inception of the lease term of what fair market value of the leased equipment will be at the end of the lease term 
we record and periodically review and adjust residual values based on historical experience and market studies conducted by independent third parties primarily based on the economic life of products  type of products and the availability of a secondary market 
goodwill goodwill represents the difference between the purchase price and the related underlying tangible net asset values resulting from business acquisitions and is originally stated at cost 
annually  or if conditions indicate an earlier review is necessary  the carrying value of the reporting unit is compared to an estimate of its fair value 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value  goodwill is impaired  and will be written down in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
product warranty the accrued liability for warranty costs is based on an estimated amount needed to cover future warranty obligations incurred as of the balance sheet date for products sold 
this estimated amount is determined by historical product data and management s knowledge of current events and actions 
the reserve is adjusted periodically based on actual claims experience and changes in anticipated claim rates 

table of contents pension and other post retirement benefits the determination of the obligation and expense for pension and other post retirement benefits is dependent on the selection of certain actuarial assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions include  among others  the discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets and rates of increase in compensation and health care costs 
these assumptions are reviewed and updated annually based on relevant external and internal factors and information 
income taxes deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
these assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse 
the company has net operating loss carryforwards available in certain jurisdictions to reduce future taxable income 
future tax benefits for net operating loss carryforwards are recognized to the extent that realization of these benefits is considered more likely than not 
this determination is based on the expectation that related operations will be sufficiently profitable or various tax  business and other planning strategies available to us will enable us to utilize the operating loss carryforwards 
we cannot be assured that we will be able to realize these future tax benefits or that future valuation allowances will not be required 
to the extent that available evidence about the future raises doubt about the realization of a deferred income tax asset  a valuation allowance is established 
forward looking statements from time to time  in written reports and oral statements  the company discusses its expectations regarding future performance 
for example  certain portions of this annual report on form k contain various forward looking statements 
such statements involve certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to vary 
the company s performance may differ materially from that contemplated by forward looking statements for a variety of reasons  including  but not limited to competitive and general economic conditions uncertainty domestically and internationally  delayed or lost sales and other impacts related to acts of terrorism  acts of war or governmental action  changes in domestic or international laws  rules and regulations  including the impact of changed environmental laws  rules or regulations  major disruptions at our key facilities or in the supply of any key raw materials  competitive pricing pressure  pricing changes by the company or its competitors  currency fluctuations  changes in customer demand and order patterns  changes in the financial stability of customers or dealers including changes in their ability to pay amounts owed to the company  changes in relationships with customers  suppliers  employees and dealers  product sales mix  the success including product performance and customer acceptance of new products  current product innovations and platform simplification  and their impact on the company s manufacturing processes  the ability of the company to effectively cull older products  the ability of the company to successfully negotiate new credit facilities  possible acquisitions or divestitures by the company  the company s ability to reduce costs  including ramp up costs associated with new products and

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the principal market risks ie the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices to which we are exposed include foreign exchange risks and interest rates on debt 
foreign exchange risks operating in international markets involves exposure to the possibility of volatile movements in foreign exchange rates 
these exposures may impact future earnings and or cash flows 
revenue from foreign locations primarily europe and canada represented approximately of our consolidated revenue in and the economic impact of foreign exchange rate movements is complex because such changes are often linked to variability in real growth  inflation  interest rates  governmental actions and other factors 
these changes  if material  could cause us to adjust our financing and operating strategies 
therefore  to solely isolate the effect of changes in currency does not accurately portray the effect on these other important economic factors 
as foreign exchange rates change  translation of the income statements of our international subsidiaries into us dollars affects year over year comparability of operating results 
while we generally hedge specific transaction risks  we generally do not hedge translation risks because we believe there is no long term economic benefit in doing so 
changes in foreign exchange rates that had the largest impact on translating our international operating profit for related to the euro and the canadian dollar versus the us dollar 
we estimate that a adverse change in foreign exchange rates would have increased our operating loss by approximately million in both and  assuming no changes other than the exchange rate itself 
for each year  this would have represented approximately of our non us operating loss 
as discussed above  this quantitative measure has inherent limitations 
further  the sensitivity analysis disregards the possibility that rates can move in opposite directions and that gains from one currency may or may not be offset by losses from another currency 
the translation of the assets and liabilities of our international subsidiaries is made using the foreign exchange rates as of the end of the year
