critical accounting policies for the company include revenue recognition  accounting for software licensed to customers  accounting for long lived assets  accounting for income taxes and accounting for retirement benefits 
revenue recognition sales of computer hardware and business forms products are recorded when title passes upon shipment to customers 
revenues from software license fees are accounted for in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue when i pervasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  iii the sales price is fixed or determinable  and iv collectibility is reasonably assured

the application of sop requires judgment  including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements as defined in emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  and if so  whether vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists for those elements 
software revenues which do not meet the criteria set forth in eitf issue no 
 application of aicpa sop to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entity s hardware  are recorded ratably over the contract period as services are provided

 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
sfas no 
specifies that costs incurred in creating a computer software product should be charged to expense when incurred  as research and development  until technological feasibility has been established for the product 
technological feasibility is established either by creating a detail program design or a tested working model 
judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established 
the company follows a standard process for developing software products 
this process has five phases selection  definition  development  delivery and general customer acceptability gca 
when using proven technology  management believes that technological feasibility is established upon the completion of the definition phase detail program design 
when using newer technology  management believes that technological feasibility is established upon completion of the delivery phase tested working model 
once technological feasibility is established  software development costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers gca 
software development costs consist primarily of payroll and benefits for both employees and outside contractors 
upon general release of a software product  amortization is determined based on the larger of the amounts computed using a the ratio that current gross revenues for each product bears to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues for that product  or b the straight line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product  ranging from three to seven years

the company accounts for these assets under the provisions of sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill not be amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually 
the statement also requires recognized intangible assets with finite useful lives to be amortized over their useful lives 
long lived assets  goodwill and intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable from future cash flows 
future cash flows are forecasted based on management s estimates of future events and could be materially different from actual cash flows 
if the carrying value of an asset is considered impaired  an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns

 employers accounting for pensions and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
these statements require the use of actuarial models that allocate the cost of an employee s benefits to individual periods of service 
the accounting under sfas no 
and sfas no 
therefore requires the company to recognize costs before the payment of benefits 
certain assumptions must be made concerning future events that will determine the amount and timing of the benefit payments 
such assumptions include the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  the rate of future compensation increases and the healthcare cost trend rate 
in addition  the actuarial calculation includes subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate the projected benefit obligation 
the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates  or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences may result in a significant impact on the amount of postretirement benefit expense recorded in future periods 
the company annually evaluates the assumptions used to determine postretirement benefit expense for its qualified and non qualified defined benefit plans 
the company adjusted assumptions used to measure the amount of postretirement benefit expense  reducing the discount rate from in fiscal year to in fiscal year and reducing the expected long term rate of return on plan assets from in fiscal year to in fiscal year the company is not required to make minimum contributions to its postretirement plans in fiscal year  although the company may elect to make contributions 
in fiscal year  the company made voluntary contributions of  to its qualified pension plans
