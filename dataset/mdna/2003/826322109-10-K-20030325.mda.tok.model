item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis provides information which management believes is relevant for an assessment and understanding of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto 
the information contained below may be subject to risk factors 
we urge you to review carefully the section risk factors in this form k for a more complete discussion of the risks associated with an investment in our securities 
see note on forward looking statements and risk factors under item overview our continuing operations derive revenues from our health maintenance organization  managed indemnity plans and military health care services 
to a lesser extent  we also derive revenues from non hmo and insurance products consisting of fees for workers compensation third party administration  utilization management services and ancillary products  professional fees consisting primarily of fees for providing health care services to non members and co payment fees received from members  and investment and other revenue 
our principal expenses consist of medical expenses  military contract expenses  and general and administrative expenses 
medical expenses represent capitation fees and other fee for service payments paid to independently contracted physicians  hospitals and other health care providers to cover members  pharmacy costs  as well as the aggregate expenses to operate and manage our wholly owned multi specialty medical group and other provider subsidiaries 
as a provider of health care management services  we seek to positively affect quality of care and expenses by contracting with physicians  hospitals and other health care providers at negotiated price levels  by adopting quality assurance programs  monitoring and managing utilization of physicians and hospital services and providing incentives to use cost effective providers 
military contract expenses represent payments to providers for health care services rendered under the tricare program  as well as administrative costs to operate the military health care subsidiary 
general and administrative expenses generally represent operational costs other than those directly associated with the delivery of health care services and military contract services 
discontinued operations 
during the third quarter of  we announced our plan to exit the texas hmo health care market and received formal approval from the texas department of insurance to withdraw our hmo operations in mid october 
we ceased providing hmo health care coverage in texas on april  as part of our plan to exit texas  in the third quarter of  we recorded a charge of million for premium deficiency costs  the write down of certain assets  legal and restitution costs  and various other exit related costs 
we elected to early adopt statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets or sfas no 
 effective january  in accordance with sfas no 
 beginning january   our texas hmo health care operations were reclassified and presented as discontinued operations 
on january   we announced that we were exploring strategic alternatives for our workers compensation insurance company  cii financial  inc  or cii 
the alternatives may include a sale  spin off or management buyout 
the disposal of the operations was approved by our board of directors on december  accordingly  beginning in the fourth quarter of  we reclassified our workers compensation insurance business as discontinued operations 
we will continue to operate the business until a disposal occurs 
in conjunction with the decision to dispose of the workers compensation operations  cii recorded valuation adjustments of million  million after tax  to reduce this business to its estimated net realizable value upon disposition 
the valuation adjustments included the write down of accounts receivable  fixed assets and certain other assets of million and additional loss reserves of million for the accident year and million for prior accident years 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
in preparing these financial statements  we are required to make judgments  assumptions and estimates  which we believe are reasonable and prudent based on the available facts and circumstances 
these judgments  assumptions and estimates affect certain of our revenues and expenses and their related balance sheet accounts and in disclosing our contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our assumptions and estimates primarily on historical experience and trends and factor in known and projected trends 
on an on going basis  we re evaluate our selection of assumptions and the method of calculating our estimates 
actual results  however  may differ from our calculated estimates and this difference would be reported in our current operations 
the following discusses our most critical accounting policies and estimates  which have been reviewed by the audit committee of our board of directors 
medical premiums and expenses 
medical premium revenues are recorded in the month when we are obligated to provide services to our enrolled members 
premiums received in advance of the coverage period are recorded as unearned premiums 
our premium revenues are net of an estimate for an allowance for retroactive adjustments 
at december   our allowance for retroactive adjustments for health care premium revenues was million 
retroactive adjustments result from changes in enrollments that relate to prior periods due to delays in processing or reporting by employers 
we use historical trends and known activities to estimate our premium allowances 
any subsequent difference between actual premium adjustments and previously estimated premium adjustments would be reflected in that subsequent year s operating results 
health care medical expenses are recorded in the period when services are provided to enrolled members  including estimates for provider costs which have been incurred as of the balance sheet date but not yet reported to us 
we use a variety of standard actuarial projection methods to make these estimates and we must use our judgment in selecting development factors and assumed trends 
in making our projections  we consider medical cost utilization and trends  changes in internal processes  the average interval between the date services are rendered and the date claims are received and or paid  denied claims activity  disputed claims activity  utilization  seasonality patterns and changes in membership 
our assumptions could be affected by the timing of the receipt of claims  the timing of processing claims and unanticipated changes  such as adverse legal outcomes  legislative or regulatory changes  new interpretations of existing laws or regulations or disputed contract provisions that result in our having to provide new or extended benefits and changes in our health care delivery system or costs 
any subsequent changes in an estimate for a prior year would be reflected in that subsequent year s operating results 
management believes  based on information presently available  that the recorded liability for medical claims payable  which at december   represented of our total consolidated liabilities or million  are reasonable and adequate to cover future health care claim payments 
however  a difference between the recorded liability and actual developed claim payments could have a material impact to our financial results 
for example  a increase in medical claims payable as of december   would reduce reported net income for the year by  or and diluted earnings per share would be reduced by 
military contract revenues and expenses 
military contract revenue is recorded based on the contract price as agreed to by the federal government 
the contract was based on prior years data provided by the government along with assumptions of future trends 
the contract contains provisions that adjust the contract price based on actual experience  which we call the bid price adjustment  or bpa  and for government directed change orders 
for the year ended december   we estimate that approximately million or of the total military contract revenues were for bpa and change orders 
at december   military accounts receivable due from the federal government was million of which approximately million was for accrued bpa and change order revenues 
as the data becomes available from the government  we compare the actual results to the contract assumptions and the estimated effects of these adjustments are recognized on a monthly basis 
in addition  we record revenue based on estimates of the earned portion of any contract change orders not originally specified in the contract 
the bpa and government directed change orders are subject to negotiation and we must use our judgment in making our estimates 
the actual negotiated price could be substantially different from what we had originally estimated 
any subsequent difference would be reported in that subsequent year s operations 
military contract health care costs are recorded in the period when services are provided to eligible beneficiaries  including estimates for provider costs which have been incurred as of the balance sheet date but not reported to us 
we use a variety of actuarial projection methods to make these estimates and we must use our judgment in selecting development factors and assumed trends 
our assumptions  which are in large part related to the same assumptions we use in estimating military contract revenues  could be affected by unanticipated changes  such as new interpretations of contract provisions that result in our having to provide new or extended benefits and changes in our health care delivery system or costs 
we must also factor into our assumptions the limited risk sharing that we have with the government in providing health care services 
any substantial change in our estimates may to a large degree be mitigated by the risk sharing contract provision 
at december   our military health care payable was million 
any subsequent changes in an estimate for a prior year would be reflected in that subsequent year s operating results 
investment securities 
at december   we had total investments for continuing operations of million 
all of these investments are classified as available for sale and are presented at fair value 
except for restricted cash and investments  which totaled million at december   and are reported as non current assets  the remainder of these investments of million are available to support current operations and are therefore reported as current assets 
our discontinued operations had total investments of million of which million was classified as available for sale and the balance of million was classified as held to maturity 
held to maturity investments are reported at amortized cost because we have the intent and ability to hold these investments until they mature 
unrealized investment gains and losses  net of related income taxes  on the available for sale investments are included as a separate component of stockholders equity until realized 
realized gains and losses are calculated using the specific identification method and are included in investment and other revenues 
we periodically review our investment portfolio to determine if there is an impairment that is other than temporary 
we must use our judgment in testing for impairment and we consider  among other factors  the length of time and the extent of a security s unrealized loss  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  economic forecasts and market or industry trends 
if the impairment is determined to be other than temporary  a realized loss is recognized at the date of determination 
to date  we have not experienced any significant impairments that were other than temporary in our investments 
however  due to the current economic environment and the volatility of the securities market  testing for impairment has become more difficult and there is no assurance that future impairments may not be sustained  which could adversely impact our business and results of operations 
for example  if an other than temporary impairment occurred that reduced our investments by at december   our reported net income for the year would be reduced by million or and fully diluted earnings per share would be reduced by 
litigation and legal accruals 
we are subject to various claims and other litigation in the ordinary course of business 
such litigation includes  but is not limited to  claims of medical malpractice  claims for coverage or payment for medical services rendered to hmo members and claims by providers for payment for medical services rendered to hmo and other members 
we may also face claims for punitive damages that are not covered by insurance 
we are also subject to claims for workers compensation and claims by providers for payment for medical services rendered to injured workers 
with respect to certain pending actions  we maintain commercial insurance coverage with varying deductibles for which we maintain estimated reserves for our self insured portion based upon our current assessment of such litigation 
in addition  we accrue estimated legal defense and other settlement costs based on our assessment of the available information  including our outside legal counsel s assessment of the case 
we also assess potential legal exposure  based on the available information  to determine if a precautionary notice of potential claim should be reported to our insurers and if an accrual should be established 
workers compensation loss and loss adjustment expenses 
discontinued operations workers compensation insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses  or lae  are based upon the accumulation of cost estimates for reported claims occurring during the period as well as an estimate for losses that have occurred but have not yet been reported 
similar to the health care medical expenses  we use a variety of standard actuarial projection methods to make these estimates and we must use our judgment in selecting development factors and assumed trends 
unlike health care medical expenses  where the cost to provide health care services is substantially completed within one year  workers compensation claims can be paid out over a substantial number of years due to certain lifetime benefits 
in addition  the period between when a claim is reported to us and when the injury occurred could be longer than one year and when we are no longer insuring the account 
loss and lae reserves have a significant degree of uncertainty when related to their subsequent payments 
although our reserves are established on the basis of a reasonable estimate  it is not only possible but probable that our reserves will differ from their related subsequent developments 
underlying causes for this uncertainty include  but are not limited to  uncertainty in development patterns  unanticipated inflationary trends affecting the cost of services covered by the insurance contract  adverse legal outcomes and new interpretations of laws or regulations or of disputed contract provisions that result in our having to provide new or extended benefits 
this uncertainty can result in both adverse as well as favorable development of actual subsequent activity when compared to the reserve established 
during the past four years  we have had adverse development in our previously recorded loss and lae reserves that has ranged from a low of million to a high of million 
any subsequent change in loss and lae reserves established in a prior year would be reflected in that subsequent year s operating results 
management believes  based on information presently available  that the recorded liability for loss and lae reserves is reasonable and adequate to cover future workers compensation claim payments 
at december   loss and lae reserves represented of the liabilities of discontinued operations and of our total consolidated liabilities 
a change between the recorded liability and actual developed claim payments could have a material impact to our business and results of operations 
for example  a increase in loss and lae reserves  not covered by reinsurance  as of december   would reduce reported net income for the year by million or and diluted earnings per share would be reduced by reinsurance recoverable 
included in the assets of discontinued operations is reinsurance recoverable  which represents the estimated amount of unpaid workers compensation loss and lae reserves that would be recovered from our reinsurers and  to a lesser extent  amounts billed to the reinsurers for their portion of paid losses and lae 
reinsurance receivable for ceded paid claims is recorded in accordance with the terms of the agreements and reinsurance recoverable for unpaid losses and lae is estimated in a manner consistent with the claim liability associated with the reinsurance policy 
any significant changes in the underlying claim liability could directly affect the amount of reinsurance recoverable 
reinsurance recoverable  including amounts related to paid and unpaid losses  are reported as assets rather than a reduction of the related liabilities 
reinsurance contracts do not relieve us from our obligations to enrollees  injured workers or policyholders 
if our reinsurers were to fail to honor their obligations because of insolvency  disputed contract provisions or for other reasons  we could incur significant losses 
prior to entering into reinsurance contracts  we evaluate the financial condition of our reinsurers to minimize our exposure to significant losses from reinsurer insolvencies 
in addition  we periodically monitor the financial strength of our reinsurers to determine if an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance recoverables is warranted 
to date  we have never had to write off a workers compensation reinsurance recoverable balance and no allowance for uncollectible amounts has been established 
at december   reinsurance recoverable for workers compensation was million 
any subsequent change in reinsurance recoverable established in a prior year would be reflected in that subsequent year s operating results 
management believes  based on information presently available  that the recorded balance for reinsurance recoverables is reasonable and collectible 
a change between the recorded balance and the actual developed recoverable could have a material impact to our business and results of operations 
for example  a decrease in reinsurance recoverables as of december   would reduce reported net income for the year by million or and diluted earnings per share would be reduced by 
deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities result from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years 
our temporary differences arise principally from certain net operating losses  accrued expenses  reserves that are discounted for tax return purposes  depreciation and impairment charges 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of the existing temporary differences 
a valuation allowance is established for those portions of the deferred tax assets that we consider to be more likely than not unrealizable 
at december   our total deferred tax assets  including discontinued operations  was million and our total deferred tax liabilities were million 
management believes  based on information presently available  that the recorded deferred tax assets are reasonable and recoverable 
a change between the recorded asset and the subsequently used deferred tax asset could have a material impact to our business and results of operations 
for example  a decrease in the deferred tax asset as of december  would reduce reported net income for the year by  or and diluted earnings per share would be reduced by 
other 
in addition to the most critical accounting policies and estimates discussed above  other areas requiring us to use judgment  assumptions and estimates include  but are not limited to  workers compensation earned but unbilled premiums  contractual discounts on professional fee revenue  allowances for doubtful receivables  other accrued liabilities  accrued payroll and taxes  post employment benefit liabilities  accrued policyholders dividends  unearned premium revenue and contingent assets and liabilities 
for a more extensive discussion of our accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
results of operations the following table sets forth selected operating data as a percentage of revenues for the periods indicated years ended decembe r  operating revenues medical premiums military contract revenues professional fees investment and other revenues total operating expenses medical expenses military contract expenses general and administrative expenses asset impairment  restructuring  reorganization and other costs total operating income loss from continuing operations interest expense other income expense  net income loss from continuing operations before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes income loss from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations net income loss year ended december  compared to total operating revenues increased approximately to billion from billion for the change in operating revenues was comprised of the following an increase in medical premiums of million an increase in military contract revenues of million an increase in professional fees of million a decrease in investment and other revenues of approximately  medical premiums from our hmo and managed indemnity insurance subsidiaries increased million or 
the million increase in premium revenue reflects a increase in medicare member months the number of months individuals are enrolled in a plan  a increase in medicaid member months and a increase in commercial member months 
the growth in medicare member months contributes significantly to the increase in premium revenues as the medicare per member premium rates are more than three times higher than the average commercial premium rate 
hmo and pos premium rates for renewing commercial groups increased on average to while the overall rate increase  including continuing business and new members  resulted in an approximate increase 
managed indemnity rates increased approximately 
we did not receive a medicaid rate increase in and we do not anticipate one in the basic medicare rate increase received in for the las vegas area was approximately 
our overall medicare rate increase was approximately due primarily to the following an increase in the social hmo membership as a percentage of our total medicare membership 
the social hmo members have a higher average rate than our other medicare members 
over of our las vegas  nevada medicare members are enrolled in the social hmo medicare program 
we experienced increased risk factors in our social hmo membership which contributes to higher rates and corresponding medical expenses 
we received rate increases in excess of for membership outside of the las vegas area 
the centers for medicare and medicaid services  or cms  formerly known as the health care financing administration  or hcfa  may consider adjusting the reimbursement factor or changing the program for the social hmo members in the future 
at this time  however  the final reimbursement per member for has not been determined and there is no guaranty that the social hmo contract will be renewed beyond it should be noted that congress has in the past agreed to extend the contract 
if the reimbursement for these members decreases significantly and related benefit changes are not made timely  there could be a materially adverse effect on our business 
continued medical premium revenue growth is principally dependent upon continued enrollment in our products and upon competitive and regulatory factors 
military contract revenues increased million or 
the increase in revenue is primarily the result of additive change order work and is significantly offset by increased military contract expenses associated with those change orders 
the congressionally approved department of defense  or dod  fiscal year budget included several sweeping changes to the tricare program 
in april  smhs began implementation of a prescription drug program for beneficiaries over age likewise  in october  smhs implemented tricare for life which is a comprehensive health care benefit to those retired military beneficiaries over age both of these modifications resulted from congressional changes to the program 
smhs administers the expanded benefits only to the over age retiree military population 
smhs does not directly fund claims payment or bear any health care underwriting risk on these program modifications for the actual level of health care service utilization and does not record any claim payments or related revenue on these program modifications 
smhs will complete the last year of a five year contract in may  but it has successfully completed negotiations with the dod to extend the contract for up to four years at the government s sole option on a year to year basis 
the dod is also currently procuring managed care services under the next generation tricare contract  or the t nex contract  in a combined and larger north region covering michigan  ohio  kentucky  indiana  illinois  wisconsin  virginia and north carolina in addition to the areas that make up region which we currently serve 
smhs submitted its bid to the dod for the t nex contract for the north region on january   with sierra as a proposed guarantor 
the award decision for this contract is initially expected to be made in mid once awarded  the new contractor is scheduled to be fully operational in region by the third quarter of  based on the current timetable set by the dod  and the new contract would supersede the remainder of the contract extension we have negotiated with the dod under our current tricare region contract 
in march  we contributed million of the proceeds of the sierra debentures to smhs in furtherance of its bid for the t nex contract 
professional fees increased million or as a result of higher average co pays and increased visits at our provider subsidiaries 
investment and other revenues decreased approximately  or due primarily to a decrease in the average investment yield during the period offset by an increase in the average invested balance 
investment and other revenues now include the revenue associated with administrative services  which were previously reported as part of specialty product revenues 
medical expenses increased million or due primarily to our increased membership 
medical expenses as a percentage of medical premiums and professional fees decreased to from 
the decrease is primarily due to premium yields in excess of cost and utilization increases which were partially offset by higher bed days in our medical claims payable liability requires us to make significant estimates 
see the discussion of our medical claims payable liability under critical accounting policies and estimates for a further explanation 
during the third quarter of  the company entered into a new hospital contract 
with this new contract  which began october   the company holds some form of contracted provider relationship with every hospital in the las vegas area 
military contract expenses increased million or 
the increase is consistent with the increase in revenues discussed previously 
health care delivery expense consists primarily of costs to provide managed health care services to eligible beneficiaries in accordance with sierra s tricare contract 
under the contract  smhs provides health care services to approximately  eligible individuals of active duty military personnel  military retirees under the age of and dependents of military retirees through a network of approximately  health care providers and certain other subcontractor partnerships 
also included in military contract expenses are costs incurred to perform specific administrative services  such as health care appointment scheduling  enrollment  medical and network management services as well as health care advice line services  and other administrative functions of the military health care subsidiary 
these administrative services are performed for active duty personnel and family members as well as retired military families 
general and administrative expenses  or g a  increased approximately million or 
the primary increases in g a expenses were payroll and benefits  brokers fees  which were primarily due to increased premium revenues  and facility lease expense 
the increase in facility lease expense is due to the rent payments associated with the sale leaseback transaction for our administrative buildings now being recorded as an operating expense 
previously the rent payments were recorded as interest and a reduction of principal and the assets were being depreciated 
our administrative office buildings associated with the sale leaseback transaction qualified as a sale at the end of the first quarter of this resulted in a quarterly increase in g a expenses of approximately million and a corresponding decrease in interest expense 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a further explanation of the sale leaseback transaction 
as a percentage of revenues  g a expenses were for  compared to in as a percentage of medical premium revenue  g a expenses were for  compared to for g a expenses now include the expenses associated with administrative services which were previously reported as part of specialty product expenses 
interest expense decreased million or 
interest expense related to the revolving credit facility decreased million due to a decrease in the average balance of outstanding debt during the period and a decrease in the weighted average cost of borrowing 
our average interest rate on the revolving credit facility  excluding the amortization of deferred financing fees  our interest rate swap agreement and fees on the unused portion of the credit facility was in  compared to in we incur a fee of on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility 
in addition  we are amortizing approximately  per quarter of deferred financing fees 
interest expense related to the sale leaseback transaction decreased by million as the remaining buildings qualified as a sale during see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a further explanation of the sale leaseback transaction 
we had various increases in interest expense of approximately  other income expense  net increased million 
we had a net loss on sale of assets of million in in addition  we had an increase between and for various other expense items totaling approximately  provision for income taxes was recorded at million for compared to million for the effective tax rate for was compared to for our ongoing effective tax rate is less than the statutory rate due primarily to tax preferred investments 
discontinued operations consist of our texas hmo health care operations and the cii workers compensation operations 
the loss from discontinued operations for was million compared to million for the texas hmo health care operations had a gain of million for which was offset by a loss on the cii workers compensation operations of million 
discontinued texas hmo health care operations 
the gain from the texas hmo health care operations for included gains  net of tax  related to reserves and accrued liabilities of million and to real estate of million 
during  we had favorable development in both medical claims and legal  restitution and other exit related costs 
as a result  we reduced our estimate for medical claims payable by million and our legal  restitution and other exit related costs by million 
the adjustments resulted in income  net of tax  from the discontinued texas hmo health care operations of million 
during  txhc sold four real estate properties and a piece of land which resulted in a gain  net of tax  on the sale of approximately  in conjunction with the sales we were required  under the terms of the mortgage loan agreement  to pay pre determined minimum amounts of the mortgage note 
since the principal payments resulted in a reduction of future interest  future accrued interest was reduced and a gain  net of tax  of million was recorded 
discontinued cii workers compensation operations 
the discontinued workers compensation operations for had a loss of million  which included valuation adjustments of million  or million after tax  to reduce this business to its estimated net realizable value upon disposition 
we will continue to operate the business until a disposal occurs 
net earned premiums increased by million or due primarily to a decrease in ceded reinsurance premiums of million that was partially offset by a million decrease in gross earned premiums 
gross written premiums decreased by million due primarily to reduced california premium writings 
we have been attempting to increase our premium rates  especially in california  where we have experienced significant adverse loss development 
in addition  we are becoming more selective in the types of accounts we insure 
in  our average premium rate increase on renewing california policies was approximately  which is on top of a average rate increase in due to lost business and lower amounts of new business  gross premiums written in california were reduced by million 
in other states  our average premium rate increase on renewing policies was approximately in compared to in and gross premiums written have increased by million  primarily in nevada 
due to the impact of new legislation in california see below and the continuing higher amounts of average incurred claims we have been experiencing  our rate increase in the first two months of on renewing california policies is approximately 
in addition  we continue to implement stricter underwriting guidelines 
this has resulted in a continuation of lost business and lower amounts of new business and our premiums written for the first two months of in california are down approximately over the comparable period 
premiums written in our other states are also down by approximately  primarily in colorado 
premium production results for the first two months of may not be indicative of the full year s premium production 
premiums in force are an indicator of future written premium trends and represent the total estimated annual premiums of all policies in force at a point in time 
total inforce premiums decreased by from million at december  to million at december  as noted above  our premiums written in the first two months of are significantly reduced from the first two months of total inforce premiums at february  are million  which represents a reduction of from december  at february   premiums in force for california business was reduced by to million and non california business was reduced by to million 
investment and other revenue decreased by million due to a  investment valuation adjustment and a decrease in the average investment yield during the period offset by an increase in the average invested balance 
expenses increased in the cii workers compensation operations by approximately million or 
the increase in expenses is primarily due to the following in conjunction with the decision to dispose of the workers compensation operations  cii recorded valuation adjustments  which included the write down of accounts receivable  fixed assets and certain other assets of million and an increase in loss and lae reserves of million 
approximately million in additional loss and lae is related to the increase in net earned premiums in compared to in  we recorded million of net adverse loss development for prior accident years compared to net adverse loss development of million recorded in of the million recorded  million is related to our mandatory participation in assumed reinsurance pools and million was recorded in conjunction with the valuation adjustments described above 
the net adverse loss development recorded was largely attributable to higher costs per claim  or claim severity  in california  primarily on accident years   and higher claim severity has had a negative impact on the entire california workers compensation industry in the past few periods and this trend may continue 
the loss and lae ratio for the accident year was higher by which resulted in an increase of approximately million in additional losses including the million recorded as part of the valuation adjustments 
excluding the valuation adjustment  which represents of net earned premiums  the accident year loss and lae ratio would have been less than the accident year loss ratio 
the decrease is due to the higher premium rates we have been obtaining which were substantially offset by higher estimated average incurred claims 
the net decrease in underwriting expenses  policyholders dividends and other operating expenses  excluding the valuation adjustments  was approximately  the net adverse loss development on prior accident years included those years that were covered by our low level reinsurance agreement 
this resulted in an increase in the reinsurance recoverable balance which is then reduced by amounts collected from reinsurers 
during the year ended december   we increased our ceded reserves by million and received payments from our reinsurers totaling million 
the loss and lae reserves recorded as of december  reflect our best estimate of the ultimate loss costs for reported and unreported claims occurring in accident year as well as those occurring in accident years prior to and are slightly in excess of our independent actuary s point estimate 
workers compensation claim payments are made over several years from the date of the claim 
until the final payments for reported claims are made  reserves are invested to generate investment income 
the combined ratio is a measurement of the workers compensation underwriting profit or loss and is the sum of the loss and lae ratio  underwriting expense ratio and policyholders dividend ratio 
a combined ratio of less than indicates an underwriting profit 
our combined ratio  net of valuation adjustments which represent  was compared to for the increase was primarily due to increased net adverse loss development for prior accident years 
excluding valuation adjustments and prior accident years adverse loss development  the combined ratio would have been for and for in february  california enacted assembly bill this new legislation increased benefits paid to injured workers starting january  increased loss costs  such as benefit increases  are normally built into the rate making process so that premiums are increased to cover the increase in costs 
on october   the california insurance commissioner approved an increase of in pure premium rates for new and renewal policies effective in in addition  the commissioner approved a increase in pure premium rates for the unexpired terms of policies in force at january  although we have increased our premiums  there is no assurance that our increase will be sufficient enough to cover the ultimate cost increases or that the estimate of cost increases provided by the workers compensation insurance rating bureau the organization that accumulates premium and loss data for the state of california for rate making purposes is accurate 
assembly bill is effective for claims occurring on and after january  however  due to other statutes  certain temporary total disability claims with dates of injury prior to will automatically increase to the new benefit levels effective january  under our low level reinsurance agreement  we reinsured of the first  of each claim  of the next  and of the next  the maximum net loss retained on any one claim ceded under this agreement was  this agreement covered all policies in force at july  and continued until june   when we exercised an option to extend coverage to all policies in force as of june  the termination of the low level agreement resulted in our keeping more retained losses and lae 
however  our california premium rates have been increasing  which we believe will largely mitigate the loss of this favorable reinsurance protection 
the premium rate increases on policies renewed in california during and were approximately and  respectively 
for policies effective from july   we obtained excess of loss reinsurance for of the losses above  and less than  this agreement terminated on june  and only covered claims with dates of injury occurring by that date 
we already had an existing excess of loss reinsurance agreement that covered of the losses above  the latter reinsurance agreement is a fixed rate multi year contract that expired december  we executed an option to extend the coverage for all policies in force as of december  until they expire in in the wake of the events of september  and the ensuing hardening of the reinsurance market  our new reinsurance agreements  which cover new and renewal policies effective on and after january   will cost more and has reduced coverage limits  including exclusions for terrorist acts 
we continue to retain the first  per occurrence but the maximum coverage has been reduced from statutory ie  unlimited limits to million per occurrence 
we also must meet certain annual aggregate deductibles before we can begin to recover from some of our reinsurers 
this new coverage will result in our retaining more of the losses and lae 
we have factored these higher costs into our premium rates but there is no assurance that our rates will be adequate to cover these additional costs 
the reinsurers on the new agreement consist of domestic as well as foreign reinsurers  and all are rated at least a or better by am best company as of december  reinsurance contracts do not relieve us from our obligations to injured workers or policyholders 
at december   we had million in reinsurance recoverable 
we evaluate the financial condition of our reinsurers to minimize our exposure to significant losses from reinsurer insolvencies 
we also periodically review the financial strength ratings of our reinsurers to determine if an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance is warranted 
as of december  and  no allowance was established 
at december   all of our reinsurers were rated aa and a or better by fitch ratings and the am best company  respectively 
should these companies be unable to perform their obligations to reimburse us for ceded losses  we would experience significant losses 
year ended december  compared to total operating revenues for increased approximately to billion from billion for the change in operating revenues was comprised of the following an increase in medical premiums of million an increase in military contract revenues of million a decrease in professional fees of million a decrease in investment and other revenues of million medical premiums from our hmo and managed indemnity insurance subsidiaries increased million or 
the million increase in premium revenue reflects a increase in medicare member months the number of months individuals are enrolled in a plan and a increase in commercial member months 
the growth in medicare member months contributes significantly to the increase in premium revenues as the medicare per member premium rates are over three times higher than the average commercial premium rate 
hmo premium rates for commercial groups increased approximately  managed indemnity rates increased approximately and medicare rates increased approximately 
military contract revenues increased million or 
the increase in revenue is primarily the result of additive change order work and is significantly offset by increased military contract expenses associated with those change orders 
the congressionally approved dod fiscal year budget included several sweeping changes to the tricare program

asset impairment  restructuring  reorganization and other costs for are discussed below 
asset impairments 
management adopted a plan in the second quarter of to discontinue medical delivery operations in mohave county  arizona and to sell the real estate assets located there  as well as an underperforming medical clinic in las vegas 
in connection with the restructuring plans adopted and announced by us in the second quarter of  we re evaluated the recoverability of certain long lived assets  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  or sfas no 
 and accounting principles board opinion no 
 intangible assets  or apb no 
 and determined that the carrying values of certain goodwill and other long lived assets were impaired 
in assessing the asset impairment of the long lived assets  we first allocated a portion of related goodwill to the fixed assets to be disposed of  in accordance with sfas no 
the fixed assets were then written down to estimated fair value less costs to sell  which was determined from independent valuations 
the remainder of the related goodwill was then assessed for recoverability in accordance with apb no 
based on projected discounted cash flows 
the charges recorded for the write off of goodwill totaled million related primarily to the prime holdings  inc acquisition 
the charges recorded for fixed asset impairment totaled million for the arizona and nevada operations 
restructuring and reorganization

as a result of this restructuring  we recorded charges in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring of approximately million 
of the costs recorded  million was for severance   was related to clinic closures and lease termination and  was for other costs 
other the million of costs recorded in the second quarter of relate primarily to an accrual for certain legal settlements as wells as the write down of certain receivables 
the table below presents a summary of asset impairment  restructuring  reorganization and other costs for the years indicated

management believes that the remaining reserves as of december  are adequate and that no revisions to the estimates are necessary at this time 
interest expense decreased million or 
interest expense related to the revolving credit facility decreased million due to a decrease in the average balance of outstanding debt during the period and a decrease in the weighted average cost of borrowing 
our average revolving credit facility balance was million in compared to million in our average interest rate on the revolving credit facility  excluding the amortization of deferred financing fees and our interest rate swap agreement was in compared to in the decreases were offset by an increase in interest expense of million related to the net financing obligations associated with the sale leaseback transaction and million in other interest expense 
other income expense  net decreased million 
we had a net loss on sale of assets in of million compared to a gain of million in in addition  we had an increase between and for various other income items totaling approximately  provision for income taxes was recorded at million for compared to a tax benefit of million for the effective tax rate for was compared to for the effective tax rate for reflects the non deductibility of certain portions of goodwill impairment expense recorded during the period 
discontinued operations consist of our texas hmo health care operations and the cii workers compensation operations 
the loss from discontinued operations for was million compared to million for the texas hmo health care operations had a loss of million for compared to a gain of million for the cii workers compensation operations 
discontinued texas hmo health care operations 
the loss includes costs to exit the texas hmo health care market of million offset by various other income from operations 
included in the loss were the following a asset impairment charges of million for impaired goodwill  b million for impaired real estate and other fixed assets  c medical expenses of million  primarily for adverse development on prior periods medical claims  d million for premium deficiency medical costs  e million for premium deficiency maintenance costs  and f other restructuring  reorganization and other costs of million 
discontinued cii workers compensation operations 
the discontinued workers compensation operations for had a profit of million compared to a loss of million in net earned premiums increased by million or due primarily to a decrease in ceded reinsurance premiums 
ceded reinsurance premiums decreased as our low level reinsurance agreement expired on june  and was replaced by a new reinsurance agreement with lower ceded premiums 
expenses increased in the cii workers compensation operations by approximately million or 
the increase in expenses is primarily due to the following approximately million in additional loss and lae is related to the increase in net earned premiums in compared to in  we recorded million of net adverse loss development for prior accident years compared to net adverse loss development of million recorded in the net adverse loss development recorded was largely attributable to higher costs per claim  or claim severity  in california 
higher claim severity has had a negative impact on the entire california workers compensation industry and this trend may continue 
we established a higher loss and lae ratio for the accident year  which has resulted in an increase of approximately million 
the majority of the increase is due to the termination of the low level reinsurance agreement on june   which results in a higher risk exposure on policies effective after that date and a higher amount of net incurred loss and lae 
during the second quarter of  we wrote off capitalized costs of million related to the application development of an information system software project  which was canceled because the vendor was unable to fulfill its contractual obligations 
the amounts written off included software and consulting costs of million and capitalized internal personnel costs of million 
a net increase in underwriting expenses  policyholders dividends and other operating expenses of million related primarily to the increase in net earned premiums 
the combined ratio is a measurement of the workers compensation underwriting profit or loss and is the sum of the loss and lae ratio  underwriting expense ratio and policyholders dividend ratio 
a combined ratio of less than indicates an underwriting profit 
our combined ratio was in compared to for the decrease was primarily due to significantly higher prior year adverse loss development recorded during excluding adverse loss development  the combined ratio would have been for and for the increase in the accident year loss and lae ratio was primarily due to the run off of the low level reinsurance  which resulted in our retaining more of the incurred losses 
the underwriting expense ratio decreased primarily due to higher retained net earned premiums 
liquidity and capital resources we had cash flows from operating activities for continuing operations of million for the year ended december  compared to million in we used the majority of the cash flow for the purchase of investments and for reductions of debt 
overall  discontinued operations used cash of million in compared to million in excluding cash used to purchase investments  discontinued operations used cash of  in compared to million in the improvement in continuing operations over is primarily attributable to cash from earnings and the change in assets and liabilities 
the cash flow resulting from the change in assets and liabilities of million was primarily due to the following a source of cash due to the decrease in the deferred tax asset balance of million a source of cash due to the increase in medical claims payable of million a source of cash due to the increase in other liabilities of million a source of cash due to the increase in other current liabilities of million a source of cash due to the decrease in other current assets of million a use of cash due to the decrease in military health care payable balance of million a use of cash due to the increase in the military accounts receivable balance of million various other changes in assets and liabilities accounting for the remaining source of cash of million smhs receives monthly cash payments equivalent to one twelfth of its annual contractual price with the department of defense  or dod 
smhs accrues health care revenue on a monthly basis for any monies owed above its monthly cash receipt based on the number of at risk eligible beneficiaries and the level of military direct care system utilization 
the contractual bid price adjustment  or bpa  process serves to adjust the dod s monthly payments to smhs  because the payments are based in part on dod estimates for beneficiary population and beneficiary population baseline health care cost  inflation and military direct care system utilization 
as actual information becomes available for the above items  quarterly adjustments are made to smhs monthly health care payment in addition to lump sum adjustments for past months 
in addition  smhs accrues change order revenue for dod directed contract changes 
as a result of preliminary data accumulated from the bpa process in the last quarter of  smhs will receive an upward adjustment in of approximately million to its monthly dod payments starting january our business and cash flows could be adversely affected if the timing or amount of the bpa and change order reimbursements vary significantly from our expectations 
on november   smhs entered into a securitization arrangement with general electric capital corporation 
the arrangement provides for the assignment of smhs federal government accounts receivable to smhs funding 
smhs funding is a special purpose limited liability company owned by smhs and was formed for the purpose of purchasing all receivables of smhs 
this entity is fully consolidated into smhs 
smhs funding may assign an undivided interest in certain of the receivables to a subsidiary of general electric capital corporation in the event that additional financing by smhs is warranted 
this securitization arrangement was not utilized in and we do not anticipate utilizing it in see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in the event smhs wins the competitive procurement for the north region t nex contract  smhs has received a commitment from general electric capital corporation to provide a million senior secured revolving credit facility to support smhs additional working capital needs and to refinance its existing securitization agreement 
net cash used from continuing operations for investing activities during included million in capital expenditures associated with the continued implementation of new computer systems  leasehold improvements on facilities and furniture  equipment and other capital purchases to support our growth 
this was offset by net proceeds of  from property and equipment dispositions 
the net cash change in investments for the year was an increase in investments of million as investments were purchased with available funds 
cash used in financing activities during included payments of million on debt related items offset by million in proceeds received from the sale leaseback notes and million in cash received related to the sale of stock through our employee stock purchase plan and stock option plans 
the year included net proceeds from long term borrowings proceeds less payments of million and proceeds of million related to the sale of stock through our employee stock purchase plan 
on december   we sold the majority of our las vegas  nevada administrative and medical clinic real estate holdings in a sale leaseback transaction 
as part of the transaction  we financed a portion of the sales price with mortgage notes receivable of million and provided deposits of million 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for leases  or sfas no 
 we recorded the transaction as a financing obligation of million offset by the mortgage notes receivable of million 
as of september   we had received the deposits back and full payment of the outstanding mortgage obligations 
the payments cured the continuing involvement criteria from sfas no 
and the transaction then qualified as a sale 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a further explanation 
sierra debentures in march  we issued million aggregate principal amount of senior convertible debentures due march  we used the net proceeds of the offering to repay the million outstanding under our existing credit facility and to contribute million to smhs in furtherance of its bid for the tricare next generation contract 
we also used million of the proceeds to purchase million shares of our common stock under our repurchase program 
the remainder of the net proceeds will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes  including  subject to board approval  additional share repurchases 
the debentures are convertible  at the option of the holders  into shares of sierra health services  inc common stock at a conversion price of  upon certain conditions including the sale price of sierra s common stock exceeding of the conversion price at specified times 
the debentures are puttable to us for cash or sierra common stock  at our election  on march in  and and upon certain corporate events including a change in control 
the debentures can be called for cash beginning on march  new credit facility on march   we entered into a new million revolving credit facility which replaces the amended and restated credit facility 
the new facility may be increased up to an aggregate amount of million upon receipt of new commitments from existing or additional lenders 
interest on the facility is initially libor plus 
the facility will expire on april  but can be extended  at the sole discretion of each of the lenders  until march  the new facility is available for general corporate purposes 
the new credit facility is secured by guarantees by certain of our subsidiaries and a first priority perfected security interest in i all the capital stock of each of our unregulated  material domestic subsidiaries direct or indirect as well as all of the capital stock of certain regulated  material domestic subsidiaries and ii all other present and future assets and properties of ours and those of our subsidiaries that guarantee our credit agreement obligations including  without limitation  accounts receivable  inventory  real property  equipment  contracts  trademarks  copyrights  patents  license rights and general intangibles subject  in each case  to the exclusion of the capital stock of cii financial  inc or any of its subsidiaries and certain other exclusions 
the new revolving credit facility has covenants that restrict our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to dispose of assets  incur indebtedness  incur other liens  make investments  loans or advances  make acquisitions  engage in mergers or consolidations  or make capital expenditures and otherwise restricts certain corporate activities 
in addition  we will be required to comply with specified financial ratios as set forth in the new credit agreement 
cii financial senior debentures at september   cii financial  inc  currently part of our discontinued operations  had approximately million of subordinated debentures that were due on september  these subordinated debentures were neither assumed nor guaranteed by sierra and were subordinated to sierra s credit facility debt 
in december  cii financial commenced an offer to exchange the subordinated debentures for cash and or new debentures 
on may   cii financial closed its exchange offer on million of its outstanding subordinated debentures 
cii financial purchased million in principal amount of subordinated debentures for million in cash and issued million in new senior debentures  due september   in exchange for million in subordinated debentures 
the transaction was accounted for as a restructuring of debt  therefore all future cash payments  including interest  related to the debentures will be reductions of the carrying amount of the debentures and no future interest expense will be recognized 
accordingly  the new senior debentures have a carrying amount of million consisting of principal of million and million in future accrued interest 
since the time of the exchange and as of december   sierra has purchased million in outstanding senior debentures which are eliminated upon consolidation 
to facilitate the exchange offer  sierra lent cii financial million  of which million was borrowed from california indemnity insurance company  a wholly owned subsidiary of cii financial 
in addition  california indemnity received approval from the california department of insurance to pay a dividend of million to cii financial 
in september  california indemnity received approval from the california department of insurance to pay an additional million dividend to cii financial  which was used to pay the remaining subordinated debentures that matured on september  the new senior debentures pay interest  which is due semi annually on march and september of each year  commencing on september  the new senior debentures rank senior to outstanding notes payable from cii financial to sierra and cii financial s guarantee of sierra s revolving credit facility 
the new senior debentures may be redeemed by cii financial at any time at premiums starting at and declining to for redemptions after april  in the event of a change in control of cii financial  the holders of the new senior debentures may require that cii financial repurchase them at the then applicable redemption price  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
cii is a holding company and its only significant asset is its investment in california indemnity 
of the million in cash and cash equivalents it held at december   approximately million was designated for use only by the regulated insurance companies 
cii has limited sources of cash and is dependent upon dividends paid by california indemnity 
california indemnity may only pay a dividend without the prior approval of the state insurance commissioner to the extent the cumulative amount of dividends or distributions paid or proposed to be paid in any year does not exceed the amount shown as unassigned funds reduced by any unrealized gains or losses included in any such amount on its statutory statement as of the previous december in  california indemnity cannot pay dividends without the prior approval of the state insurance commissioner 
in california indemnity paid a total of million in dividends 
we are not in a position to assess the likelihood of obtaining future approval for the payment of dividends other than those specifically allowed by law in each of our subsidiaries state of domicile 
sierra share repurchase program on january   we announced that our board of directors authorized a program for the repurchase of up to million shares of our common stock 
on february   we announced that we had repurchased approximately  shares of our common stock and that our board of directors had authorized us to purchase up to an additional  shares under our share repurchase program 
such purchases have been made from time to time at prevailing prices in the open market  by block purchase or in private transactions 
as of march   we had purchased a total of million shares for million 
statutory capital and deposit requirements our hmo and insurance subsidiaries are required by state regulatory agencies to maintain certain deposits and must also meet certain net worth and reserve requirements 
the hmo and insurance subsidiaries  including the discontinued operations  had restricted assets on deposit in various states totaling million at december  the hmo and insurance subsidiaries must also meet requirements to maintain minimum stockholders equity  on a statutory basis  as well as minimum risk based capital requirements  which are determined annually 
additionally  in conjunction with the kaiser texas acquisition  txhc entered into a letter agreement with the texas department of insurance whereby txhc agreed to maintain a net worth of million  on a statutory basis  until certain income levels were achieved 
in conjunction with the exit from the texas hmo health care market  the texas department of insurance approved a plan of withdrawal and txhc is now required to maintain deposits and net worth of at least million 
we believe we are in material compliance with our regulatory requirements 
of the million in cash and cash equivalents held at december   including discontinued operations  million was held by discontinued operations and of the remainder  million  was designated for use only by the regulated subsidiaries 
amounts are available for transfer to the holding company from the hmo and insurance subsidiaries only to the extent that they can be remitted in accordance with the terms of existing management agreements and by dividends 
the holding company will not receive dividends from its regulated subsidiaries if such dividend payment would cause violation of statutory net worth and reserve requirements 
obligations and commitments the following schedule represents our obligations and commitments for long term debt  capital leases and operating leases at december  with the exception of our amended and restated revolving credit facility  the amounts below represent the entire payment  principal and interest  on our outstanding obligations 
the outstanding balance of the amended and restated revolving credit facility is million as of december  the amount has been reflected as due in as the credit facility was refinanced and terminated in conjunction with the issuance of the sierra debentures and the new million credit facility on march  long term capital operating debt leases leases t otal in thousands continuing operations payments due in less than year  payments due in to years  payments due in to years   payments due after years  total continuing operations   discontinued operations payments due in less than year  payments due in to years  payments due in to years  payments due after years total discontinued operations 
 included in long term debt payments for discontinued operations is a mortgage loan secured by certain underlying real estate assets of the discontinued operations of million and the cii senior debentures of million 
we are actively seeking a buyer for the real estate assets and anticipate selling them by the end of as the assets are sold  we are required to make reductions on the mortgage note and completely satisfy the obligation once all of the assets have been sold 
other we have a capital budget of million and are also limited in the amount of capital expenditures we can make by our new revolving credit facility 
the planned expenditures are primarily for a new medical clinic  the purchase of computer hardware and software  furniture and equipment and other normal capital requirements 
our liquidity needs over the next months will primarily be for the capital items noted above  debt service and funds required to exit the texas hmo health care market 
we believe that our existing working capital  operating cash flow and  if necessary  equipment leasing  divestitures of certain non core assets and amounts available under our credit facility should be sufficient to fund our capital expenditures and debt service 
additionally  subject to unanticipated cash requirements  we believe that our existing working capital and operating cash flow should enable us to meet our liquidity needs on a long term basis 
we have a million interest rate swap agreement that allows us to mitigate the risk of interest rate fluctuation on our credit facility 
the original intent of the agreement was to keep our interest rate on million of the credit facility relatively fixed 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  we recorded the interest rate swap agreement at its fair value as of december  the fair value indicated that we would need to pay  to terminate the swap agreement 
if the prime rate were to decrease by  we estimate our maximum increase in annual expense associated with the swap to be approximately in the second quarter of  our board of directors authorized a million loan from us to our chief executive officer  or ceo 
in april  our board of directors authorized an additional million loan from us to our ceo 
in the second quarter of  our board of directors approved a loan amendment which extended the maturity of the principal balance along with accrued interest to december  during and  our ceo made payments of million and  respectively 
as of december   the aggregate principal balance outstanding and accrued interest for both instruments was million 
all amounts borrowed bear interest at a rate equal to the rate at which we could have borrowed funds under our revolving credit facility at the time of the borrowing plus basis points 
the amounts outstanding are collateralized by certain of the ceo s assets and rights to compensation from us 
inflation health care costs continue to rise at a rate faster than the consumer price index 
we use various strategies to mitigate the negative effects of health care cost inflation  including setting commercial premiums based on our anticipated health care costs  risk sharing arrangements with our various health care providers and other health care cost containment measures including member co payments 
there can be no assurance  however  that in the future  our ability to manage medical costs will not be negatively impacted by items such as technological advances  competitive pressures  applicable regulations  increases in pharmacy costs  utilization changes and catastrophic items  which could  in turn  result in medical cost increases equaling or exceeding premium increases 
government regulation our business  offering health care coverage  health care management services  workers compensation programs and  to a lesser extent  the delivery of medical services  is heavily regulated at both the federal and state levels 
government regulation of health care coverage products and services is a dynamic area of law that varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction 
amendments to existing laws and regulations are continually being considered and interpretation of the existing laws and rules changes from time to time 
regulatory agencies generally exercise broad discretion in interpreting laws and promulgating regulations to enforce their interpretations 
while we are unable to predict what legislative or regulatory changes may occur or the impact of any particular change  our operations and financial results could be negatively affected by any legislative or regulatory requirements 
for example  any proposals to eliminate or reduce the employee retirement income security act  or erisa  which regulates insured and self insured health care coverage plans offered by employers  pre emption of state laws that would increase litigation exposure  affect underwriting practices  limit rate increases  require new or additional benefits or affect contracting arrangements including proposals to require hmos and ppos to accept any health care provider willing to abide by an hmo s or ppo s contract terms may have a material adverse effect on our business 
the continued consideration and enactment of anti managed care laws and regulations by federal and state bodies may make it more difficult for us to manage medical costs and may adversely affect financial results 
in addition to changes in existing laws and regulations  we are subject to audits  investigations and enforcement actions 
these include possible government actions relating to erisa  the federal employees health benefit plan  or fehbp  federal and state fraud and abuse laws and laws relating to utilization management and the delivery and payment of health care 
in addition  our medicare business is subject to medicare regulations promulgated by cms 
violation of government laws and regulations may result in an assessment of damages  civil or criminal fines or penalties  or other sanctions  including exclusion from participation in government programs 
in addition  disclosure of any adverse investigation or audit results or sanctions could negatively affect our reputation in various markets and make it more difficult for us to sell our products and services 
in addition to the items described above  we urge you to review carefully the section risk factors in this form k for a more complete discussion of the risks associated with an investment in our securities 
see note on forward looking statements and risk factors under item recently issued accounting standards in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  or fin fin requires a guarantor to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation it has undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
we will apply fin to guarantees  if any  issued after december  we do not expect the adoption of fin to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  or fin fin requires an investor with a majority of the variable interests in a variable interest entity to consolidate the entity and also requires majority and significant variable interest investors to provide certain disclosures 
a variable interest entity is an entity in which the equity investors do not have a controlling interest or the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance the entity s activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support from the other parties 
we do not expect the adoption of fin to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in april  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 recission of fasb statements no

opinion no 

applying the provisions of opinion no 
will distinguish transactions that are part of an entity s recurring operations from those that are unusual and infrequent that meet the criteria for classification as an extraordinary item 
sfas no

in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  or sfas no 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
a fundamental conclusion reached by the fasb in this statement is that an entity s commitment to a plan  by itself  does not create a present obligation to others that meets the definition of a liability 
sfas no 
also establishes that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability 
the provisions of this statement are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december   with early adoption encouraged 
we did not elect to early adopt sfas no 
nor do we expect the adoption to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  or sfas no 
sfas no 
is an amendment of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas requires prominent disclosures in interim as well as annual financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported net income 
the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years ended after december  we have not yet determined if we will implement the voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting as allowed under sfas no 
for item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk for the impact of interest rate changes and changes in the market value of our investments 
we have not utilized derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our long term debt 
as of december   including discontinued operations  we have approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and current  long term and restricted investments 
of the investments  approximately million are classified as available for sale and million are classified as held to maturity 
these investments are primarily in fixed income  investment grade securities 
our investment policy emphasizes return of principal and liquidity and is focused on fixed returns that limit volatility and risk of principal 
because of our investment policies  the primary market risk associated with our portfolio is interest rate risk 
assuming interest rates were to increase by a factor of  the net hypothetical loss in fair value of stockholders equity related to financial instruments is estimated to be approximately million after tax of total stockholders equity 
of the million decrease  million is related to our discontinued operations 
we believe that such an increase in interest rates would not have a material impact on future earnings or cash flows  as it is unlikely that we would need or choose to substantially liquidate our investment portfolio 
the effect of interest rate risk on potential near term net income  cash flow and fair value was determined based on commonly used interest rate sensitivity analyses 
the models project the impact of interest rate changes on a wide range of factors  including duration and prepayment 
fair value was estimated based on the net present value of cash flows or duration estimates  assuming an immediate increase in interest rates 
because duration is estimated  rather than a known quantity  for certain securities  other market factors may impact security valuations and there can be no assurance that our portfolio would perform in line with the estimated values 
as of december   we had million in borrowings outstanding under a revolving credit facility 
the average cost of borrowing on the revolving credit facility for  including the amortization of deferred financing fees and the impact of the swap agreement  was 
if the average cost of borrowing on the amount outstanding as of december  were to increase by a factor of  our annual income before tax would decrease by approximately  as of december   cii had million principal amount of senior debentures outstanding  which is net of million in debentures purchased by sierra and eliminated upon consolidation 
the market value of the outstanding debentures was estimated to be approximately million at december   based on the last trade in before the debentures were no longer listed by the new york stock exchange 
if interest rates were to fluctuate by a factor of  we do not anticipate a material change in the fair value of the debentures based on the current market for them
