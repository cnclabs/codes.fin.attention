all of the company s operating gamma knife units are financed by means of interest bearing debt 
eight of the company s fourteen gamma knife units have been in operation for more than three years  and have lower interest expense than newer units because interest expense decreases with each principal payment 

table of contents other income and expense increase increase decrease decrease in thousands interest and other income percentage of revenue minority interest percentage of revenue interest and other income decreased  in compared to and decreased  in compared to the decrease in was primarily due to reduced return on cash investments due to the market decline in interest rates that started during and continued through  as well as lower invested cash balances 
the decrease in was primarily due to reduced return on cash investments due to the market decline in interest rates that began during minority interest increased  in and  in compared to prior years 
minority interest represents the pre tax income earned by the minority member s interest in gkf 
the increase in minority interest reflects the increased profitability of gkf 
income taxes increase increase decrease decrease in thousands income tax benefit expense percentage of revenue income tax expense increased  in compared to  and increased  in compared to the company s income tax provision for all of was reduced by a  income tax benefit from the exercise of options to purchase  common shares in the first and second quarters 
the income tax benefit is a result of compensation expense that was recognized when these options for common shares were granted in the company began recording a federal and state income tax provision in as the company s deferred tax liability began to exceed its deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance that had been provided for the deferred tax asset in excess of the deferred tax liability was eliminated in second quarter in the company recorded no income tax expense or benefit because a valuation allowance was provided for the entire deferred tax asset in excess of the deferred tax liability 
the company anticipates that it will continue to record income tax expense if it operates profitably in the future 
currently there are minimal actual tax payments required due to net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets available for tax purposes 
the company had a net operating loss carryforward for federal income tax return purposes at december  of approximately  net income increase increase decrease decrease in thousands  except per share amounts net income net income per share n a the company had net income of  in compared to  in and  in net income for included increased income from operations of  compared to  which was offset by reduced interest and other income of  net income for included a provision for federal and state income taxes of  startup costs for or and medleader of  and an

net income for included restructuring costs of  and startup costs for or and medleader of  liquidity and capital resources the company had cash and cash equivalents of  at december  compared to  at december  our expected primary cash needs on both a short and long term basis are for capital expenditures  business expansion  working capital and other general corporate purposes 
restricted cash of  at december  reflects cash that may only be used for the operations of gkf 
operating activities provided cash of  in net income of  depreciation of  and an increase in the deferred tax liability of  were offset by a decrease in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities of  and increases in prepaid expenses and other assets of  and receivables of  the company s trade accounts receivable decreased slightly to  at december  from  at december  this decrease was primarily due to a reduction in the number of days revenue outstanding in accounts receivable dso for some of the gamma knife contracts  which offset additional accounts receivable due to two new gamma knife contracts in the dso was and days as of december  and december   respectively 
we expect dso to fluctuate in the future depending on timing of customer payments received and the mix of fee per use vs 
retail customers 
other receivables increased by  primarily due to a credit on over payment of use taxes 
investing activities used  of cash in the company used  of its cash towards the purchase of equipment  primarily deposits on future gamma knife units 
this was offset by an increase in minority interest of  financing activities used  of cash during  primarily due to principal payments on long term debt of  and the payment of dividends of  proceeds received from the exercise of stock options of  was partially offset by the repurchase of common stock for working capital decreased  to  at december  from  at december  due to the decrease in cash  as well as an increase in the current portion of long term debt 
the increase in debt was primarily due to the financing of two additional gamma knife units during the company invests its cash in money market funds to minimize the potential for principal erosion 
cash is invested in these short term funds pending use in the company s operations 
the company believes its cash position combined with its working capital is adequate to service the company s cash requirements in the company finances all of its gamma knife units  and anticipates that it will continue to do so with future contracts  but there can be no assurance that financing will continue to be available on acceptable terms 
impact of inflation and changing prices the company does not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on operations because a substantial majority of the costs that it incurs under its customer contracts are fixed through the term of the contract

application of critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and follow general practices within the industry in which it operates 
application of these principles requires management to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions and judgments 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
estimates  assumptions and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value  when a decline in the value of an asset not carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment write down or valuation reserve to be established  or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event 
carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility 
the fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by other third party sources when available 
when third party information is not available  valuation adjustments are estimated in good faith by management primarily through the use of internal cash flow modeling techniques 
the most significant accounting policies followed by the company are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these policies along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this financial review  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions and estimates underlying those amounts  management has identified the determination of the allowance for doubtful accounts and revenue recognition to be two areas that required the most subjective or complex judgments  and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available 
the following are our critical accounting 
table of contents policies in which management s estimates  assumptions and judgments most directly and materially affect the financial statements revenue recognition revenue is recognized when services have been rendered and collectibility is reasonably assured  on either a fee per use or revenue sharing basis 
the company has twelve fee per use customers and two revenue sharing customers 
the fee per use agreements provide for a fixed fee per procedure  and are typically for a ten year term 
revenue is recognized at the time the procedures are performed 
the company receives a percentage of the reimbursement received by the medical center less the operating expenses of the gamma knife under the revenue sharing agreements 
revenue is recognized at the time the procedures are performed  based on an estimate of the per procedure net revenue that is being collected at the medical center 
the estimates are reviewed quarterly to ensure that the estimates represent the amounts that will be realized 
allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are recorded at net realizable value 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based on historical collections plus an allowance for probable losses 
for the revenue sharing customers  the company receives reimbursement from the customer based on the customer s collections from individuals and third party payors such as insurance companies and medicare 
for the fee per use customers  the company receives a fixed fee from the hospital or medical center for use of the gamma knife unit 
receivables are charged against the allowance in the period that they are deemed uncollectable
