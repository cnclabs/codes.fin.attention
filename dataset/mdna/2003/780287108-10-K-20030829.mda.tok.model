item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
royal gold s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including the risks described in the section titled risk factors in this annual report on form k 
overview royal gold is engaged in the acquisition and management of precious metals royalties 
although we also explore and develop properties thought to contain precious metals in exchange for royalty or other carried interests  we are primarily engaged in the acquisition of existing royalty interests and in financing projects that are in or near production in exchange for royalty interests 
we do not operate the properties on which we have royalties 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements  in conformity with accounting principles accepted in the united states of america  requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the most critical accounting policies to royal gold relate to the assumptions regarding future gold prices and the estimates of reserves and recoveries of mine operators 
we rely on reserve estimates reported by the operators on the properties in which we have royalty interests and have found them to be reasonable 
these estimates and the underlying assumptions affect the potential impairments of long lived assets and the ability to realize income tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets 
these estimates and assumptions also affect the rate at which we charge depreciation and amortization to earnings 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates these estimates and assumptions  however  actual amounts could differ from these estimates and assumptions 
the operators reserves stated as of december   were based on a gold price of per ounce 
we based our deferred tax asset valuation on a per ounce gold price as of june  if the long term gold price is substantially lower  these estimates would need to change and could result in material adverse write offs of assets and the need to establish a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset 
liquidity and capital resources at june   we had current assets of  compared to current liabilities of  for a current ratio of to this compares to current assets of  and current liabilities of  at june   resulting in a current ratio of to during fiscal  liquidity needs were met from  in royalty revenues   from the common stock issuances discussed below  our available cash resources  and interest and other income of  for calendar  based on information from the operator  we anticipate production of approximately one million ounces of gold at the pipeline mining complex 
production at the pipeline mining complex was approximately million ounces of gold during the fiscal year ended june  in july  we sold  shares of common stock  at a price of per shares  resulting in gross proceeds of  in september  we sold an additional  shares of common stock  at a price of per share  resulting in gross proceeds of  during december  we purchased high desert 
as consideration  we issued  shares of common shares and paid  in cash to the former shareholders of high desert 
at the time of acquisition  high desert had cash of  see note acquisition of high desert mineral resources  inc 
we have a million line of credit from hsbc bank usa that may be used to acquire producing royalties 
repayment of any loan under the line of credit will be secured by a mortgage on our gsr royalty at the pipeline mining complex  and by a security interest in the proceeds from any of our royalties at the pipeline mining complex 
any assets purchased with the line of credit will also serve as collateral 
at this time  no funds have been drawn under the line of credit 
we currently anticipate that current financial resources and funds generated from operations will be adequate to cover anticipated expenditures for general and administrative expense costs  exploration and business development costs  and capital expenditures for fiscal and beyond 
our current financial resources are available for royalty acquisition and to fund dividends 
in the event of a substantial acquisition  we could seek additional debt or equity financing 
we may also seek additional funding in any event from time to time if management deems appropriate 
our contractual obligations as of june  follow payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating leases rg russia long term retirement obligation total for information on our contractual obligations  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
royal gold believes it will be able to fund all existing obligations from net cash provided by operating activities 
results of operations fiscal year ended june   compared with fiscal year ended june  for the fiscal year ended june   we recorded net income of  or per basic share  as compared to net income of  or per basic share  for the fiscal year ended june  net income for the fiscal year ended june   reflects  in royalty revenues 
in fiscal  we recognized a deferred tax asset of  which increased net income for the period by per share 
for fiscal  we received royalty revenues of  from the pipeline mining complex   from the sj claims   from the leeville project   from bald mountain  and  from the martha mine 
for the fiscal year ended june   we received total royalty revenues of  of which  was attributed to our royalties from the pipeline mining complex 
this increase in royalty revenue in fiscal resulted from a higher sliding scale royalty rate from the pipeline mining complex due to a higher gold price in fiscal  and the addition of revenues from the acquired sj claims and leeville project royalties 
the royalties from the sj claims and leeville project represent revenues for approximately seven months of production 
cost of operations increased compared to the fiscal year ended june   primarily related to nevada net proceeds tax expenditures associated with the increased royalty revenues  and due to losses of  associated with the mark to market of put option contracts during the year 
costs of operations associated with approximately seven months of activity from the acquired sj claims and leeville project royalties also contributed to the increase 
general and administrative expenses of  for the fiscal year ended june   increased compared to  for the fiscal year ended june   primarily because of increased investor relations costs associated with a substantial increase in the number of our shareholders 
exploration and business development expenses increased from  for the fiscal year ended june   to  for the fiscal year ended june   primarily due to the acquisition of the rg russia interest and additional exploration and lease maintenance costs associated with the acquired high desert exploration properties in nevada 
depreciation and depletion increased from  for the fiscal year ended june   to  for the fiscal year ended june   primarily due to increased production at bald mountain and the amortization of the recently acquired sj claims and leeville project royalty properties  partially offset by lower depletion rates associated with our gsr and nvr royalties 
based upon updated production information we obtained from the operator during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a non cash impairment of mining assets of  related to our royalty interest in the mule canyon mine 
also in fiscal  we recorded a gain of  on the sale of certain patented mining claims in southwestern colorado 
we recorded a non cash charge of  related to our equity investments in yamana resources for the fiscal year ended june  the decline in value of these securities was deemed to be other than temporary and  therefore  the decline in value was recognized 
included in the charge for the fiscal year ended june   was a previous unrealized loss of  recorded in other comprehensive income 
there was no comparable charge in the current period 
interest and other income increased from  for the fiscal year ended june   to  for the fiscal year ended june   primarily due to an increase in investable funds  partially offset by lower interest rates 
as noted above  we recognized a non cash deferred tax asset of  during fiscal during fiscal  we recorded  in deferred tax expense associated with the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards  partially offset by the reduction of a portion of the remaining valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset of  fiscal year ended june   compared with fiscal year ended june  for the year ended june   we recorded net earnings of  or per basic share  as compared to net earnings of  or per basic share  for the year ended june  net earnings reflect  in royalty revenues for fiscal compared with  in royalty revenues in fiscal in fiscal  we received royalty revenues of  from million ounces of production from the pipeline mining complex  and  from our royalty at bald mountain 
in the prior fiscal year  we received royalty revenues of  from million ounces of production from the pipeline mining complex  and  from bald mountain 
this increase in royalty revenue was directly related to the higher gold price in fiscal  which also increased the royalty rate on our gsr royalty above price thresholds from the prior periods 
during the first three quarters of fiscal  the gold price averaged greater than per ounce and averaged greater than per ounce for the fourth quarter 
costs of operations of  for the year ended june   increased compared to  for the year ended june   primarily related to nevada net proceeds tax expenditures associated with the increased royalties at the pipeline mining complex 
general and administrative expenses of  for the year ended june   increased from  for the year ended june   primarily due to increased legal fees  investor relations and annual report expenses  increased listings fees and a decrease in costs allocated to exploration business development expenses 
we recorded  for non cash employee stock option compensation expense for the year ended june   resulting from employees surrendering shares at fair market value as payment for the exercise price of options 
there were none in the prior year 
exploration and business development expenses decreased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  primarily due to decreased expenditures for gold exploration in europe 
depreciation and depletion costs increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  primarily due to the increased depletion associated with our purchase of the nvr royalty at the pipeline mining complex  and higher production rates at the pipeline mining complex 
in fiscal  we recorded an impairment related to our royalty interest at bald mountain of  because of the operator s revised reserve estimates 
no impairment was taken in fiscal interest and other income decreased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  primarily due to significantly lower investment rates on funds available for investing offset by higher funds available for investing 
we recorded a non cash deferred tax asset of  during the year ended june   related to our assessment that the utilization of our net operating losses were more likely than not due to the higher gold price at fiscal year end and our history of profitability

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the market price of various precious metals varies widely and is affected by numerous factors beyond our control 
please see risk factors decreases in prices of precious metals would reduce our royalty revenues  for more information on factors that can affect gold prices 
the royalties we receive can fluctuate significantly with changes in the market price of precious metals as a result of royalty rates that are tied to the price of gold and because operators may curtail or cease mining operations on properties on which we have royalties if gold prices fall significantly 
during the fiscal year ended june   we reported royalty revenues of  with an average gold price for the period of per ounce 
the gsr royalty  on the pipeline mining complex  which produced the majority of our revenues for the period  is a sliding scale royalty with variable royalty rate steps based on the average london pm gold price for the period 
for the fiscal year  if the price of gold had averaged higher or lower by per ounce which includes a one price step in gsr  we would have recorded an increase in revenues or decrease in revenues of approximately  or  respectively 
due to the set price steps in the gsr royal ty  it is not possible to extrapolate these effects on a linear basis 
we receive royalties from the nvr royalty on the pipeline mining complex in gold  and the value of this royalty therefore depends on the price of gold 
we sold  ounces of gold bullion in fiscal at an average realized price of per ounce  and  ounces of gold bullion in fiscal at an average realized price of per ounce 
we have purchased puts for calendar quarters to protect against a significant decline in the price of gold through calendar year these puts  however  allow us to benefit from any gold price increase 
each calendar quarter covered by these puts has revenue protection for  ounces of gold at per ounce and  ounces of gold at per ounce 
under current circumstances  we have no plans to enter into additional put contracts
