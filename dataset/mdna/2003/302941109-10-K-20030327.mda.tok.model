our highly skilled professionals assist distressed companies in improving their financial position  or their creditors or other stakeholders in maximizing recovery of their claims 
we also provide other consulting services such as corporate recovery  forensic accounting  fraud investigation and asset tracing  regulatory  intellectual property and mergers and acquisitions advisory services 
our trial support practice group advises clients in all phases of litigation  including pre filing  discovery  jury selection  trial preparation  expert testimony and the actual trial 
in july  we committed to a plan to sell our applied sciences practice group  which offers a broad range of forensic engineering and scientific investigation services 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the results of operations of our applied sciences practice group are treated as discontinued operations 
unless otherwise indicated  all amounts included in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are from continuing operations 
we have included in note pending sale of applied sciences practice group to the consolidated financial statements a more comprehensive discussion about our discontinued operations 
our direct cost of revenues consists primarily of employee compensation and related payroll benefits  the cost of outside consultants assigned to revenue generating activities and other related expenses billable to clients 
in  our direct costs were of revenues  consistent with our long term goal of and an improvement from in and in selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits paid to office and corporate staff  as well as rent  marketing  corporate overhead expenses and depreciation and amortization of property and equipment 
in  selling  general and administrative expenses  including depreciation and amortization of property and equipment  accounted for about of our revenues  a substantial reduction from the of revenues realized in and in the primary reason for this relative decline is that the majority of our growth in revenues has been in our financial consulting practice groups which have lower ratios of selling  general and administrative expenses than our trial support practice groups 
our corporate overhead costs  which are included in selling  general and administrative expenses  represented about of revenues in  in and in the relative decline in our corporate overhead costs reflects the increased leverage of our overhead and corporate support services in relation to our increased revenue base 
we had goodwill related to our continuing operations of about million at december  that we recorded principally from business combinations that we completed in the last five years  including million related to our acquisition of brs and million related to our acquisition of technology financial consulting  inc tfc  both during this goodwill represented about of our total assets at december  as of january   we no longer amortize this goodwill  but rather make at least annual assessments of impairment 
our applied sciences practice group had goodwill of approximately million at december   which is included in long term assets of discontinued operations in the consolidated balance sheets 

table of contents recent developments acquisition of brs on august   we acquired brs for million in cash and  shares of our common stock valued at million 
on a pro forma basis  as adjusted to present brs as a company separate from pwc  brs had revenues of million and operating income of million for the year ended december   and revenues of million and operating income of million for the eight month period ended august  pending sale of our applied sciences practice group in july  we committed to a plan to sell our applied sciences practice group  consisting of two separate business components or asset disposal groups  lwg  inc and lwg  inc 
prior to september   these two business components comprised our applied sciences reporting segment 
in january  we sold the lwg asset disposal group for total consideration of million  consisting of cash of million and a seven year note in the amount of million 
an after tax loss of approximately  was recorded in the accompanying financial statements to present the lwg asset disposal group at its fair value less cost to sell 
the remaining sea asset disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition  subject only to the terms that are usual and customary for sales of such asset disposal groups 
an active program to locate a buyer  and other actions required to complete the plan to sell  have been initiated 
the sale of the sea asset disposal group is considered probable and is expected to be completed by the end of actions necessary to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn 
the assets comprising the sea asset disposal group are measured at the lower of their carrying amount or estimated fair value less cost to sell 
property and equipment held for sale are no longer being amortized 
we currently expect to recover the carrying value of the assets of the sea disposal group  which was million at december  however  it is reasonably possible that the ultimate amount realized from the sale may be less than the carrying value 
depending on the sale price and the tax structure of the transaction  the amount realized after taxes from the sale may be less than the carrying value 
because the operations and cash flows of the applied sciences practice group will be eliminated from our future operations as a result of the pending disposal transaction  and because we will not have any significant continuing involvement in the held for sale operations after the disposal transactions  the results of the applied sciences practice group s operations are reported for all periods presented as a separate component of income  net of income taxes 

table of contents critical accounting policies general 
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which we have prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  goodwill  income taxes and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we derive substantially all of our revenue from providing professional services to our clients 
most of these services are rendered under arrangements that require the client to pay us a fee for the hours that we incur at agreed upon rates 
we also bill our clients for the cost of the production of our work products and other direct expenses that we incur on behalf of the client  such as travel costs and materials that we purchase to produce presentations for courtroom proceedings 
we recognize our revenue from professional services as work is performed and expenses are incurred 
the basis for our policy is the fact that we normally obtain engagement letters or other agreements from our clients prior to performing any services 
in these letters and other agreements  the clients acknowledge that they will pay us based upon our time spent on the matter and at our agreed upon hourly rates 
revenues recognized but not yet billed to clients  have been recorded as unbilled receivables in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
billings in excess of services provided represents amounts billed to clients  such as retainers  in advance of work being performed 
some clients pay us retainers before we begin any work for them 
we hold retainers on deposit until we have completed the work 
we apply these retainers to final billings or refund any excess over the final amount billed to clients  as appropriate  upon our completion of the work 
if the client is in bankruptcy  fees for our professional services are subject to approval by the court 
in some cases  a portion of the fees to be paid to us by a client is required to be held by a court until completion of our work 
we make the initial determination whether to record all or a portion of such a holdback as revenue prior to collection on a case by case basis 
bad debts 
we also maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our clients to pay our fees or for disputes that affect our ability to fully collect our billed accounts receivable as well as potential fee reductions imposed by bankruptcy courts 
we estimate this allowance by reviewing the status of past due accounts and recording general reserves based on our experiences in these cases and historical bad debt expense 
our actual experience has not varied significantly from our estimates 
however  if the financial condition of our clients were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to pay our fees  we may need to record additional allowances in future periods 
this risk is mitigated by the retainers that we require from some of our clients prior to performing significant services 

table of contents we believe that the addition of brs will not have a significant effect on our bad debt expense as a percentage of revenue 
goodwill 
we have remaining goodwill from continuing operations of about million at december  that we recorded for business combinations that we completed principally in the last five years 
in prior years  this goodwill was amortized over to year periods and resulted in amortization expense approximating million in as of january   we adopted financial accounting standards board statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets statement 
under the new rules  goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are subject to at least annual impairment tests in accordance with the statement 
accordingly  we no longer amortize this goodwill  but rather make at least annual assessments of impairment 
during the second quarter of  we completed the transitional impairment tests required by statement for this goodwill as of january  no impairment of goodwill was identified as a result of these tests 
in the future  we will be making impairment tests during the fourth quarter of each year 
in making these impairment assessments  we must make subjective judgments regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the reporting units of our business that are associated with this goodwill 
it is possible that these judgments may change over time as market conditions or our strategies change  and these changes may cause us to record impairment charges to adjust our goodwill to its estimated implied fair value 
in december  we wrote down million of goodwill related to the lwg asset disposal group to reflect the net assets of this disposal group at their fair value less cost to sell 
the lwg asset disposal group was sold in january effect of recent accounting pronouncements as of january   the company adopted financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets statement 
statement supersedes and serves to clarify and further define the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and provides a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of 
statement does not apply to goodwill and other intangible assets that are not amortized  and retains the company s current policy to recognize an impairment loss only if the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable from its undiscounted future cash flows and to measure the impairment loss as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset 
in april  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 recission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections statement 
among other changes  statement rescinds statement  which required all gains and losses from extinguishment of debt to be aggregated and classified as an extraordinary item  net of the related tax effect 
statement provides that gains and losses from extinguishment of debt should be classified as extraordinary items only if they are unusual or infrequent or they otherwise meet the criteria for classification as an extraordinary item  and observes that debt extinguishment transactions would seldom  if ever  result in extraordinary item classification of the resulting gains and losses 
we will adopt statement in january  and upon adoption  we will report as other expenses any extraordinary losses that we incur upon the extinguishment of our debt 
in addition  when we present for comparative purposes financial statements issued prior to december   we will reclassify to other expenses any 
table of contents extraordinary losses that we recorded upon the early extinguishment of debt in those periods 
in  we reported a million loss from the early extinguishment of certain debt 
upon the sale of the sea asset disposal group  our agreement with our bank lending group requires the cash proceeds to be used to retire portions of our debt 
also  in february  we completed the public offering of approximately million shares of our common stock for million cash less approximately million of offering costs 
in accordance with our credit agreement  we used half the proceeds from the stock offering to retire portions of our long term debt 
in february  we wrote off  of deferred bank financing fees in connection with the early debt retirement related to the public offering and we estimate that we will write off up to approximately  of deferred bank financing fees upon the sale of the sea asset disposal group  depending upon the sales price and payment terms 
in accordance with statement  we will record these charges as other expense in the statement of operations 
in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities statement 
statement supersedes eitf issue no 
liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity 
statement requires that costs associated with an exit or disposal plan be recognized when incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
statement is to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after december  we do not expect that our adoption of statement will have a material effect on our reported results of operations and financial position

results of continuing operations years ended december   and revenues 
revenues from continuing operations for the year ended december  increased to million compared with million in the greatest growth was in our bankruptcy and restructuring practice groups  which includes the august acquisition of brs  in addition to our organic growth 
our forensic consulting practices also experienced significant growth in revenue  principally attributable to our ability to recruit seasoned financial professionals to meet the continued strong demand for our consulting services  as well as the acquisition of tfc at the beginning of the year 
our trial support practice groups revenue also grew during  although at a more modest rate 
the number of our professional employees at december  grew from december  of this growth  occurred as a result of organic growth and the development of new practice areas  and the remainder as a result of the acquisitions of brs and tfc 
during the first quarter of  we also raised our professional rates by an average of 
the new practice areas we added during the year have contributed to the revenues and operating income during the year 

table of contents revenues in increased when compared to  primarily through organic growth 
the revenue growth was principally the result of our acquisition of policano manzo  llc p m in early and the successful integration of its financial professionals into our existing practices 
direct cost of revenues 
direct cost of revenues of our continuing operations was of our total revenues in  in and in the improvement in and resulted primarily from the relative growth of our turnaround  restructuring and bankruptcy practice area  which has higher gross margins than our other practice areas 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
as a percent of our total revenues  these expenses  which include depreciation and amortization of property and equipment  were in  in and in this decline in was primarily the result of the growth in our turnaround  restructuring and bankruptcy services  which have a lower selling and general administrative expense as a percent of revenues than our other practice areas 
the increase in was the result of costs incurred to open larger offices in several major cities  including new york and washington  dc 
amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets 
as required by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we no longer amortize goodwill  beginning january  amortization of goodwill of continuing operations was million in and million in in connection with the acquisition of brs  we recorded approximately million of other intangible assets  consisting primarily of client backlog  which are being amortized over their useful lives ranging from to months 
we began to amortize these other intangible assets in september  and amortization expense in was million 
interest income and expense  net 
net interest expense consisted primarily of interest on debt we incurred to purchase businesses over the past several years 
interest rates during have been lower than in  which rates were lower than in as a result  interest expense in was million  compared to million in despite our additional borrowings in august to acquire brs 
interest expense in was million related to borrowings to acquire p m  a portion of which was at interest 
we achieved lower interest rates by refinancing our outstanding debt in late and experienced declining market interest rates on our revolving credit facility 
income taxes 
our effective tax rate for continuing operations in was  compared to in and in we expect our effective tax rate from continuing operations to approximate in see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to our effective tax rates during each of these years  and a summary of the components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities 
extraordinary loss on early extinguishment of debt  net of income taxes 
as a result of the write off of unamortized debt discount and deferred financing costs associated with the debt that we refinanced or retired early in  we had a million loss on early extinguishment of debt  net of taxes in we have included in effect of recent accounting pronouncements a more comprehensive discussion of our accounting for this extraordinary loss 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources during the year ended december   net cash provided by our operations was about million as compared to about million for and million in we continue to finance operations and capital expenditures solely through cash flows from operations 
cash flows from operations have improved year over year since primarily due to increases in net income 
during  this increase occurred primarily because our total revenues from continuing operations increased by  while our direct cost of revenues and our selling  general and administrative expenses declined as a percentage of revenues to from in 
additionally  we realized a million income tax benefit from stock option exercises that further increased our cash flows from operations during the income tax benefit from stock option exercises was million in and  in our operating assets and liabilities consist primarily of billed and unbilled accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued expenses and accrued compensation expense 
changes in these balances are affected by the timing of billings and collections of receivables as well as payments for compensation arrangements 
during  changes in operating assets and liabilities increased cash flows from operations by million 
this was primarily because our accrued compensation expenses increased by million and billed and unbilled accounts receivables declined by million when compared to the prior year 
a substantial portion of total compensation for our professional employees is in the form of incentive compensation  which is normally paid after year end 
our average collection period in declined when compared to  primarily because of retainers paid by clients prior to the performance of our services 
our customary collection terms range from to days for all of our clients 
during  we spent million for net additions to property and equipment  primarily for expansion of one of our major offices and investments in technology and equipment for our new practice areas  including approximately million related to the integration of brs 
this trend in investing activities  after giving effect to the recent acquisition of brs  is in line with our historical net additions to property and equipment of million in  and million in in  we expect to spend approximately million for property and equipment additions  including million related to the integration of brs

our financing activities in all periods have consisted principally of borrowings and repayments under long term debt arrangements as well as issuances of common stock and exercises of warrants and stock options 
our long term debt arrangements have principally been obtained to provide financing for our acquisitions of businesses  particularly brs in and policano manzo  llc in we borrowed million in the third quarter of to acquire brs and during the year we repaid million in debt 
at december   we had availability under our revolving line of credit of million 
on august   we terminated our previous credit facility and entered into the new credit facility in connection with our acquisition of brs 
the new credit facility consisted of our then existing term loan for million  a new term loan for million and a new revolving credit 
table of contents facility for million 
on september  and december   we repaid million of the million term loan 
our debt under the credit facility bears interest at an annual rate equal to libor plus an applicable margin or an alternative base rate defined as the higher of the lender s announced prime rate or the federal funds rate plus the sum of basis points and an applicable margin 
if not prepaid  our million term loan will mature on december   and our million term loan will mature on august  under the credit facility  we have granted the lenders a security interest in substantially all of our assets 
at december   we had outstanding aggregate debt under the credit facility of million  bearing interest at per annum 
we will not be subject to any penalties for early payment of the debt under the credit facility 
under the provisions of the credit facility  we must apply at least half of the net proceeds that we obtain from any public offering of our equity securities to repayment of the debt 
in february  we completed the public offering of million shares of our common stock for million cash 
we used half the proceeds of the public offering to reduce our debt

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risk associated with changes in interest rates on our variable rate debt 
we have managed this risk by entering into interest rate swaps 
these hedges reduce our exposure to rising interest rates  but also reduce the benefits from lower interest rates 
we do not anticipate any material changes to our market risk exposures in interest rate swaps with notional principal amounts of million at december  were designated as hedges against a portion of our outstanding debt and were used to convert the interest rate on a portion of our variable rate debt to fixed rates for the life of the swap 
our pay rate on the hedged portion of our debt was at december   compared to our receive rate of 
because of the effectiveness of our hedge of variable interest rates associated with our debt  the change in fair value of our interest rate swaps resulting from changes in market interest rates is reported as a component of other comprehensive income
