item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations buckeye technologies inc and its subsidiaries manufacture value added cellulose based specialty products in the united states  canada  germany  ireland and brazil and sell these products in worldwide markets 
on august   we acquired the cotton cellulose business of fibra  sa located in americana  brazil 
during fiscal years and  we made difficult strategic decisions to reduce overheads and streamline our manufacturing and headquarters operations 
these decisions are reflected in our restructuring program and in our announcement of the discontinuation of production of cotton linter pulp at our lumberton  north carolina facility 
volume and net sales net sales in fiscal were million  an increase of million or over fiscal of million 
the anticipated decline in cotton cellulose sales prices from their unusually high levels in fiscal was offset by higher volume and sales prices for fluff pulp and airlaid nonwoven materials 
the decrease in net sales in fiscal of million or from fiscal year sales of million was primarily due to lower sales prices on fluff pulp and airlaid nonwovens and lower shipment volumes of cotton cellulose 
these decreases were partially offset by higher sales prices of cotton cellulose 
operating income our operating income for fiscal was million  a decrease of million compared to fiscal this decrease was primarily due to higher restructuring and impairment costs recorded in fiscal these costs are explained in detail later in this discussion 
in fiscal  operating income was million or of sales compared to million or of sales in fiscal this decrease was mainly due to the sales issues previously noted  increased cost of cotton raw materials and the restructuring and impairment costs discussed below 
the decrease was partially offset by reducing sales  research and administrative expense by million or versus the prior year 
the reduction in research expenses was the result of focusing efforts on key projects 
our results in both fiscal and were adversely affected by the weak global economy 
segment results historically  we reported results in one segment 
although nonwoven materials  processes  customers  distribution methods and regulatory environment are very similar to specialty fibers  we believe it is now appropriate for nonwoven materials to be disclosed as a separate reporting segment from specialty fibers 
the specialty fiber segment is an aggregation of cellulosic fibers based on both wood and cotton 
we make financial decisions and allocate resources based on the sales and operating income of each segment 
we allocate selling  research  and administration expense to each segment and we use the resulting operating income to measure the performance of the segments 
we exclude items that are not included in measuring business performance  such as restructuring costs  asset impairment and certain financing and investing costs 
specialty fibers external net sales in fiscal were million compared to million in fiscal  a decrease of million or 
the decrease in net sales in fiscal was due to lower selling prices on cotton based products being only partially offset by slightly higher unit volumes and the restart of operations at our americana facility 
during fiscal  specialty fiber external net sales decreased by million from the million achieved in fiscal the reduction was the result of a reduction in the selling price of fluff pulp  being only partially offset by higher average prices on cotton based products 
sales price increases and decreases for cotton based products are influenced by the variability in the cost and supply of cotton fibers 
as the cost of these fibers increased in we increased our sales prices 
as these costs fell during fiscal we reduced our sales prices 
during fiscal these prices decreased by approximately  while in fiscal they increased by approximately 
fluff pulp prices vary with market conditions and fell dramatically during fiscal during fiscal  our average fluff pulp price increased by versus fiscal market supply constraints  coupled with a weakening us dollar and higher energy costs  provided the basis for us to increase our list price of fluff pulp by per metric ton effective april  the higher price was partially implemented during the fiscal fourth quarter and was the major contributor to the fact that our average fluff pulp price during the past year was higher than the fiscal average level 
the announced summer closure of one of the world s largest dissolving wood cellulose mills has significantly tightened the market for high purity dissolving wood pulps 
we announced a per metric ton price increase effective april  for wood based products 
as we have many calendar year supply agreements with customers  the full impact of this price increase will not be felt until calendar year however  selling prices meaningfully improved in the fiscal fourth quarter compared to the third quarter 
we are capitalizing on this opportunity to significantly reduce our shipments of fluff pulp and to increase our shipments of dissolving chemical pulps particularly in acetate applications 
in the fourth quarter we were able to increase chemical pulp and customized fiber shipments by  metric tons and reduce fluff pulp shipments by a corresponding amount 
we understand that the competitor s mill closed in july and we understand produced a six month supply of inventory for a key customer 
therefore  we do not anticipate seeing most of the benefits of this change until calendar year operating income for fiscal was million of net sales compared to million of net sales for fiscal  an improvement of million 
this improvement in operating income reflected modestly higher fluff pulp pricing  a more favorable dissolving wood pulp sales mix  operating the americana facility for most of the year  and operating expense reductions 
these improvements were partially offset by margin compression for cotton based products  increased energy and chemicals costs  a cotton raw material write down  and the impact of a strengthening euro on the operating cost of our glueckstadt  germany facility 
the cost items noted above had a greater impact on the second half of the year than the first half of the year and many are one time or relatively short term in nature 
during fiscal  the decrease in operating income versus fiscal was due mainly to the sales issues previously noted and the increased cost of cotton fibers 
these were partially offset by cost reductions resulting from reduced employment and lower sales  research and administrative expenses 
we restarted manufacturing at our brazilian plant in july this facility manufactures chemical cellulose and distributes it to a single customer 
the plant was idled due to the high cost of cotton linters 
during fiscal  we reached an agreement on an extension of the initial volume agreement with our customer 
this extension is anticipated to provide sufficient volume to enable the plant to continue to operate at full capacity through calendar year nonwoven materials net sales in fiscal were million compared to million in fiscal  an increase of million or 
the increase in net sales in fiscal was primarily due to an increase in shipments and strengthening of the euro 
net sales in fiscal were million or less than fiscal primarily due to lower shipment volume  reduced sales prices and mix changes 
capacity expansions in calendar have resulted in an oversupplied market with very competitive pricing in north america 
the weak global economy has negatively impacted the growth rate of airlaid nonwovens thus slowing the absorption of available capacity 
nonwoven materials operating income in fiscal was million compared to an operating loss of million in fiscal  an improvement of million 
our improvement in operating income in fiscal reflects significant reductions in waste and cost reductions 
these improvements were partially offset by the impact of a strengthening canadian dollar on the operating cost of our canadian facility 
our fiscal operating loss was million lower than our operating income of million in fiscal operating results in fiscal decreased mainly due to the reduced sales prices previously noted 
during fiscal  we were starting up a new airlaid nonwovens machine in north carolina and installing and starting up new stac pac tm folding machines at all of our locations 
these start ups caused us to incur higher than normal waste levels and manufacturing costs 
these negative factors were partially offset by a decrease in sales  research and administrative expense in fiscal restructuring costs in early april  we announced our decision to discontinue production of cotton linter pulp at our lumberton  north carolina facility 
we completed this partial closure in august we will continue to produce cosmetic cotton products at that location 
this decision reflects a steady decline in demand in the cotton fiber paper industry  which has contracted by about one third since the late s 
while cotton linter pulp is one of our core businesses  current demand does not economically justify operating a facility that can only produce products for paper applications 
to better meet our customers needs  we are consolidating our us cotton linter pulp production at our larger memphis  tennessee facility 
this facility can produce products for both chemical and paper applications 
this consolidation and the resulting increase in facility utilization will enable us to improve our operating results by over million annually and reduce our working capital needs by approximately million 
we expect this more efficient operating configuration to reduce our cost of goods sold beginning in january as a result of the restructuring  approximately positions were eliminated 
involuntary termination benefits and miscellaneous costs of million were paid and million were accrued as of june  we expect payments related to the restructuring program to continue throughout fiscal all costs of this program are reported in the statements of operations as restructuring costs 
we are continuing to pursue cost reduction initiatives company wide 
in fiscal  we initiated a restructuring program designed to deliver cost reductions by reducing overhead expenses 
all costs of this program are reported in our statements of operations as restructuring costs 
in connection with this program  we paid involuntary termination benefits of million in fiscal and accrued million as of june  during fiscal  the major portion of the million accrual was paid 
as a result of this restructuring  approximately positions were eliminated  which reduced our costs by over million annually 
our nonwovens and specialty fibers businesses in north america and europe were impacted by this cost reduction program 
as a part of this restructuring  we closed our engineering offices located in finland 
impairment of long lived assets we have evaluated the ongoing value of the property  plant and equipment associated with the lumberton facility 
using the guidance issued under sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  we determined that long lived assets associated with the lumberton facility  having a carrying amount of million  were no longer recoverable and were  in fact  impaired 
we wrote these assets down to their estimated fair value of million in fiscal this impairment resulted in a million non cash charge against our operations and an million after tax increase in our net loss in fiscal additional information is included in note  impairment and restructuring costs  to the consolidated financial statements 
in fiscal we abandoned certain airlaid nonwovens equipment  which had a carrying value of million 
we evaluated the ongoing value of these assets  which principally included an uninstalled airlaid machine acquired with the purchase of walkisoft in and also included some equipment that did not operate as intended  and wrote them down to their estimated fair value of million 
we also abandoned certain engineering drawings and fully impaired the carrying value of million 
these impairments contributed to a million decrease in our operating income  and a million after tax increase in net loss  in fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded impairment costs of million 
the impairment costs related primarily to obsolete airlaid nonwovens packaging equipment that we replaced with more efficient stac pac tm packaging lines 
net interest expense and amortization of debt costs we incurred net interest expense and amortization of debt costs of million in fiscal compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
this decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates in fiscal  which were partially offset by million of interest capitalization in fiscal net interest and amortization of debt costs were million higher in fiscal compared to million incurred in fiscal the increase was primarily due to higher levels of debt 
the increase was partially offset by the favorable effect of an interest rate swap agreement which we entered into in may this interest rate swap agreement exchanged fixed rate interest payments for floating rate interest payments on million of our million aggregate principal amount senior subordinated notes due october  foreign exchange  amortization of intangibles and other foreign exchange  amortization of intangibles and other expense in fiscal  and were million  million and million  respectively 
the million favorable variance in fiscal from was due primarily to an increase of million in foreign currency gains partially offset by the settlement of a contract dispute and other miscellaneous items 
the higher costs in fiscal versus fiscal were due primarily to lower foreign currency gains in fiscal income taxes our effective tax rate for fiscal was versus in fiscal  which is primarily attributable to the utilization of a foreign net operating loss carryforward that had previously been fully reserved 
our effective tax rate for fiscal was versus in fiscal  due to the recognition of higher research and development tax credits in fiscal financial condition our financial condition improved during the current fiscal year 
we are committed to reducing our debt  strengthening our operations and continuing to improve our profitability and cash flow 
cash flow net cash provided by operating activities for the years ended june   and we provided cash from operating activities of million  million and million  respectively 
the million improvement in fiscal cash flow was due to a million increase in operating results before the effect of certain non cash charges a change in accounting and impairment of long lived assets 
additionally  reductions in inventories and the receipt of an million federal tax refund that reduced prepaid expenses contributed to the improved cash flows from operations in fiscal these improvements were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable due to a change in the terms of a supply contract with a significant customer 
the decrease in cash provided by operating activities of million for fiscal was due primarily to lower earnings  lower current liabilities and an increase in prepaid expenses as a result of the federal tax refund not yet received 
net cash used in investing activities in fiscal  we used million cash in investing activities  as compared to million in fiscal million of the reduction was due to the redemption of short term investments in fiscal that had been purchased in fiscal the remaining decrease in fiscal was due to continued efforts to reduce capital expenditures and the lack of any major construction or projects during the year 
the decrease in cash used in investing activities during fiscal was due primarily to the completion of the airlaid nonwovens machine at the gaston plant 
additionally  we used million in cash in fiscal to acquire the americana facility 
overall  we used cash to make capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal in fiscal and fiscal  we made these expenditures primarily to construct  purchase  modernize and upgrade our production equipment and facilities 
a majority of our capital expenditures in fiscal related to the construction of the large airlaid nonwovens machine at the gaston plant 
we expect to make capital expenditures including environmental expenditures and capital costs associated with the scheduled extended maintenance shutdown at our foleyplant for fiscal of not more than million 
net cash provided by used in financing activities in fiscal  we used cash to repay million in debt including a million note payment to upm kymmene in connection with the purchase of walkisoft 
in may  we sold  shares of common stock at a price of per share 
the net proceeds of the offering were million 
we also used additional borrowings under our bank credit facilities along with the cash provided by operating activities to make our and million note payments to upm kymmene 
our board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to million shares of our common stock 
under this authorization  we will hold the repurchased shares as treasury stock and such shares will be available for general corporate purposes  including the funding of employee benefit and stock related plans 
in fiscal  we repurchased no shares of our common stock 
through june   we had repurchased a total of  shares under the current board authority 
at june   we were prohibited from repurchasing our common stock under the terms of our revolving credit facility 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual cash obligations as of june  certain of these contractual obligations are reflected in our balance sheet  while others are disclosed as future obligations under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states

in millions june  june  debt and capital lease obligations on balance sheet less interest rate swap non cash fair value adjustment to debt less cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and short term investments net debt liquidity we have the following major sources of financing revolving credit facility  receivables based credit facility and senior subordinated notes 
our revolving credit facility and senior subordinated notes contain various covenants 
based on our recent results of operations and the amendment to our revolving credit facility in july  which was effective as of june   we were in compliance with these covenants as of june  and believe we will remain in compliance through the maturity of the revolving credit facility on march  revolving credit facility 
we amended our revolving credit facility on july  to modify the financial covenants applicable for the period from june  through march  in addition  the lenders under this facility consented to an issuance of new senior notes  provided that we use at least million of the proceeds therefrom to permanently reduce amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
these lenders also consented to the prepayment of the million note due october  to upm kymmene 
the interest rate applicable to borrowings under this revolving credit facility is the agent s prime rate plus to or at our option  a libor based rate ranging from libor plus to libor plus 
this facility is secured by substantially all of our assets located in the united states 
at june   we had outstanding borrowings under this facility of million 
letters of credit issued through our revolving credit facility of million were outstanding at june  the amount available for borrowing under our credit facility was million at june  receivables based credit facility 
on september   we amended our million receivables based credit facility 
the amendment extended the maturity of this facility from december  to december  the interest rate applicable to borrowings under this facility is one week libor plus  and the facility is secured by certain insured receivables 
at june   we had outstanding borrowings under this facility of million  unused borrowing availability of million  and restricted cash of million 
senior subordinated notes 
at march   our fixed charge coverage ratio as defined in the subordinated note indentures fell below falling below the ratio does not breach any covenant and is not an event of default under any of our debt agreements 
however  as specified in those indentures  until such time as this ratio again equals or exceeds  we can only incur debt that falls within the definition of permitted indebtedness in the indentures 
as a result  if we elect to refinance any of our bank credit facilities  unless we can then satisfy the fixed charge coverage ratio  we will be unable to refinance that portion of our credit facilities that exceed million 
under each such indenture  the ratio test is measured on a rolling four quarter basis 
while we can offer no assurance in this regard  we believe that our operating results will improve over the next several quarters and that such improved results together with recent reductions in our outstanding debt  will enable us to exceed the required ratio necessary to incur ratio debt under the senior subordinated note indentures 
interest rate swap 
in may  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement in respect of million of our fixed rate senior subordinated notes maturing in october the swap agreement converts interest payments from a fixed rate to a floating rate of libor plus 
the terms of the swap agreement are consistent with the terms of our october notes  thus  this arrangement qualifies as a fair value hedge under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
as such  we record the net effect from the swap agreement as part of interest expense 
the swap agreement settles quarterly until its maturity in october during fiscal years  and  the swap agreement reduced our net interest expense by million  million and million  respectively 
based upon interest rates then applicable with respect to similar transactions  we recorded the fair value of the swap agreement as an asset and recorded a corresponding increase in debt of million at june  and million at june  current portion of long term debt 
in fiscal  we reclassified our canadian loan maturing september   our final payment to upm kymmene due october  and our receivables based credit facility maturing december  from long term debt to current liabilities 
we reached agreement in principle to renew our canadian million us million equivalent based on exchange rates in effect at june  loan 
if we elect to renew our canadian loan  it will have a maturity date of november  and will require a reduction of the principal to canadian million at september  and all other terms and conditions will remain the same 
shelf registration 
on march   we filed a form s shelf registration statement 
the shelf registration statement allows us to issue various types of securities  including common stock  preferred stock and debt securities  from time to time  up to an aggregate of million 
we filed the registration statement to gain additional flexibility in accessing capital markets for general corporate purposes 
this s registration statement became effective on april  on may   we sold  shares of common stock under this registration statement at a price of per share 
the net proceeds of the offering were million 
we used these proceeds for general corporate purposes 
refinancing of senior subordinated notes and revolving credit facility 
we announced on september  that we plan to offer million of senior notes due in a private offering 
the notes will be guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries 
we anticipate using a portion of the net proceeds from the private placement to redeem our senior subordinated notes due  pay the related redemption premium and repay a portion of our existing bank debt 
we can make no assurance that this offering will be completed 
we are also considering a new revolving credit facility in order to refinance our existing revolving credit facility 
we have received commitments from three lending institutions  including affiliates of the initial purchasers of the senior notes  to participate in a new credit facility  subject to customary closing conditions 
however  we have reached no decision to proceed with this refinancing at this time 
while we can offer no assurances  we believe that our cash flow from operations  together with current cash  cash equivalents and short term investments on hand  will be sufficient to fund necessary capital expenditures expected not to exceed million in fiscal  meet operating expenses and service our debt obligations for the foreseeable future 
critical accounting policies this discussion and analysis is based upon our consolidated financial statements 
our critical and significant accounting policies are more fully described in note  accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements 
some of our accounting policies require us to make significant estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates underlying our financial statements requires the exercise of management s judgment 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and any such differences may be material to our financial statements 
our management exercises critical judgment in the application of our accounting policies in the following areas  which significantly affect our financial condition and results of operation 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and with our independent auditors 
inventories we state our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  we are required to make judgments as to future demand requirements and estimated market values and compare that with the current cost of inventory 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected  we may be required to write down inventory 
depreciation we provide for depreciation on our production machinery and equipment at our cotton cellulose and airlaid nonwovens plants using the units of production depreciation method 
under this method  we calculate depreciation based on the expected productive hours of the assets and  in any case  subject to a minimum level of depreciation 
if the estimated productive hours of these assets change in the future  we may have to adjust depreciation expense per unit of production accordingly 
we use the straight line method for determining depreciation on our other capital assets 
long lived assets long lived assets are reviewed for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
for assets that are to be held and used  an impairment is recognized when the estimated undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset or group of assets is less than their carrying value 
if impairment exists  an adjustment is made to write the asset down to its fair value  and a loss is recorded as the difference between the carrying value and fair value 
fair values are determined based on quoted market values  discounted cash flows or internal and external appraisals  as applicable 
assets to be disposed of are carried at the lower of carrying value or estimated net realizable value 
see note of our consolidated financial statements for information concerning impairment charges 
we have made acquisitions in the past that included a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets 
on july   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 and  as a consequence  discontinued the amortization of goodwill 
under the guidelines of sfas no 
 goodwill is subject to an annual impairment test based on its estimated fair value 
unless circumstances otherwise dictate  we perform our annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter 
we will continue to amortize other intangible assets that meet certain criteria over their useful lives  and these assets will also be subject to an impairment test based on estimated fair value 
we typically base our estimates of fair value on operating earnings and adjust these by a discount factor in valuing future cash flows 
the determination of an impairment loss is complex and requires that we make many assumptions and estimates 
if our estimates of future cash flows or the underlying assumptions and estimates change  we may need to record additional impairment losses in the future 
planned maintenance shutdowns we accrue the cost of periodic planned maintenance shutdowns over the period between shutdowns  based on our estimates of incremental spending and fixed overhead cost 
if we revise our estimates of the costs of such shutdowns  or if the period between shutdowns changes  then we may be required to adjust the amount of such accruals 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin 
fin requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity 
the primary beneficiary is defined as the party which  as a result of holding its variable interest  absorbs a majority of the entity s expected losses  receives a majority of its expected residual returns  or both 
fin is effective immediately for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after january  the provisions of fin must be applied to all other variable interest entities for the first interim or annual period beginning after june  we do not expect the adoption of fin to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
cumulative effect of change in accounting effective july   we adopted sfas no 
 which established new accounting and reporting requirements for goodwill and other intangible assets as described in our critical accounting policies 
based on our assessment  effective july  we reduced our goodwill by million in the converting business  which we had purchased in the merfin acquisition in we recorded no tax benefit as a result of the reduction in the carrying value of goodwill 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange  interest rates  raw material costs and the price of certain commodities used in our production processes 
to reduce such risks  we selectively use financial instruments 
all hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to clearly defined policies and procedures 
further  we do not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes 
the following risk management discussion and the estimated amounts generated from the sensitivity analyses are forward looking statements of market risk  assuming that certain adverse market conditions occur 
actual results in the future may differ materially from those projected results due to actual developments in the global financial markets 
the analysis methods used to assess and mitigate risks discussed below should not be considered projections of future events or losses 
a discussion of our accounting policies for risk management is included in accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
interest rates the fair value of our long term public debt is based on an average of the bid and offer prices at year end 
the fair value of the credit facility approximates its carrying value due to its variable interest rate 
the carrying value of other long term debt approximates fair value based on our current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing instruments 
the carrying value and fair value of long term debt at june  were million and million  respectively  and at june  were million and million  respectively 
market risk is estimated as the potential change in fair value resulting from a hypothetical decrease in interest rates and amounts to million at june  and million at june  we had million of variable rate long term debt outstanding at june  at this borrowing level  a hypothetical increase in interest rates would have a million unfavorable impact on our pretax earnings and cash flows 
the primary interest rate exposures on floating rate debt are with respect to us prime rates and european interbank rates 
at june   we had one interest rate swap agreement with a total notional value of million  terminating on october  we entered into the interest rate swap agreement on may  the agreement involves the exchange of fixed rate interest payments at for floating rate interest payments at three month libor plus over the life of the agreement without the exchange of any underlying principal amounts 
the net amounts paid or received under this interest rate swap agreement are recognized as an adjustment to interest expense 
foreign currency exchange rates foreign currency exposures arising from transactions include firm commitments and anticipated transactions denominated in a currency other than an entity s functional currency 
buckeye and our subsidiaries generally enter into transactions denominated in their respective functional currencies 
our primary foreign currency exposure arises from foreign denominated revenues and costs and their translation into us dollars 
the primary currencies to which we are exposed include the european euro  canadian dollar and the brazilian real 
we generally view as long term our investments in foreign subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the us dollar 
as a result  we do not generally hedge these net investments 
however  we use capital structuring techniques to manage our net investment in foreign currencies as considered necessary 
the net investment in foreign subsidiaries translated into dollars using the year end exchange rates is million and million at june  and  respectively 
the potential loss in value of our net investment in foreign subsidiaries resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates amounts to million at june  and million at june  this change would be reflected in the equity section of our consolidated balance sheet 
cost of raw materials amounts paid by us for wood  cotton fiber and fluff pulp represent the largest component of our variable costs of production 
the availability and cost of these materials are subject to market fluctuations caused by factors beyond our control  including weather conditions 
significant decreases in availability or increases in the cost of wood or cotton fiber  to the extent not reflected in prices for our products  could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
commodities in order to minimize market exposure  we use forward contracts to reduce price fluctuations in a desired percentage of forecasted purchases of natural gas over a period of generally less than one year 
there were no natural gas contracts outstanding at june  requiring fair value treatment 
at june   the company had natural gas contracts outstanding and included in other assets with a fair value of million 
the fair value is based upon exchange quoted market prices of comparable instruments 
while the contract outstanding as of june  did not qualify for hedge accounting  neither its effect on the results of operations nor the year end position was material to our overall results 
exposure to commodity products also creates volatility in pricing 
if our research and development efforts do not result in the commercialization of new  proprietary products  we will continue to have significant exposure to fluff pulp and other commodity products  which could result in volatility in sales prices and profits 
industry cyclicality the demand and pricing of our products  particularly fluff pulp  are influenced by the much larger market for papermaking pulps which is highly cyclical 
the markets for most cellulose and absorbent products are sensitive to both changes in general global economic conditions and to changes in industry capacity 
both of these factors are beyond our control 
the price of these products can fluctuate significantly when supply and demand become imbalanced for any reason 
financial performance can be heavily influenced by these pricing fluctuations and the general cyclicality of the industries in which we compete 
it is not certain that current prices will be maintained  that any price increases will be achieved  or that industry capacity utilization will reach favorable levels 
the demand  cost and prices for our products may thus fluctuate substantially in the future and downturns in market conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
contingencies our operations are subject to extensive general and industry specific federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws and regulations 
we devote significant resources to maintaining compliance with such requirements 
we expect that  due to the nature of our operations  we will be subject to increasingly stringent environmental requirements including standards applicable to wastewater discharges and air emissions and will continue to incur substantial costs to comply with such requirements 
given the uncertainties associated with predicting the scope of future requirements  there can be no assurance that we will not in the future incur material environmental compliance costs or liabilities 
for additional information on environmental matters  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
forward looking statements except for the historical information contained herein  the matters discussed in this annual report are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  economic  competitive  governmental  and technological factors affecting our operations  markets  products  services and prices  and other factors 
we undertake no obligation to publicly release the result of any revisions to these forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events
