critical accounting policies preparation of this annual report on form k requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the company s financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
the company s critical accounting policies  including the assumptions and judgments underlying them  are disclosed under the caption statement of accounting and financial policies under item these policies have been consistently applied and address such matters as revenue recognition  depreciation methods  inventory valuation  asset impairment recognition and pension and postretirement expense 
while policies associated with estimates and judgments may be affected by different assumptions or conditions  the company believes its estimates and judgments associated with the reported amounts are appropriate in the circumstances 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
the company considers the policies discussed below as critical to an understanding of the company s financial statements as application of these policies places the most significant demands on management s judgment  with financial reporting results relying on estimation of matters that are uncertain 
senior management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates and the related disclosure herein with the audit committee of the board of directors 
provision for allowances  claims and doubtful accounts the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of customers and sets credit limits based upon review of the customers current credit information and payment history 
the company monitors customer payments and maintains a provision for estimated credit losses based on historical experience and specific customer collection issues that the company has identified 
estimation of such losses requires adjusting historical loss experience for current economic conditions and judgments about the probable effects of economic conditions on certain customers 
the company cannot guarantee that the rate of future credit losses will be similar to past experience 
the company considers all available information when assessing each quarter the adequacy of the provision for allowances  claims and doubtful accounts 
inventory valuation the company s inventories are valued at cost  which is not in excess of market 
cost is determined by the last in  first out lifo method 
the company regularly reviews inventory on hand and records provisions for obsolete and slow moving inventory based on historical and current sales trends 
changes in product demand and the company s customer base may affect the value of inventory on hand which may require higher provisions for obsolete inventory 
deferred tax asset the company records operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and the estimated effect of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts in the consolidated balance sheet 
the company follows detailed guidelines in each tax jurisdiction when reviewing tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provides for valuation allowances as required 
deferred tax assets are reviewed for recoverability based on historical taxable income  the expected reversals of existing temporary differences  tax planning strategies and  most importantly  on projections of future taxable income 
the projections of future taxable income require assumptions regarding volume  selling prices  margins  expense levels and industry cyclicality 
if the company is unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  the company will be required to record additional valuation allowances against the company s deferred tax assets 
pension and postretirement benefit plan assumptions the company sponsors various benefit plans covering a substantial portion of its employees for pension and postretirement medical costs 
statistical methods are used to anticipate future events when calculating expenses and liabilities related to the plans 
the statistical methods include assumptions about  among other things  the discount rate  expected return on plan assets  rate of increase of health care costs and the rate of future compensation increases 
the company s actuarial consultants also use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates when estimating expenses and liabilities 
the assumptions used in the actuarial calculation of expenses and liabilities may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences may result in a significant impact on the amount of pension or postretirement benefit expense the company may record in the future 
for example  regarding pension expense  a 
percent decrease in the discount rate from percent to percent would have increased annual pension expense by million 
also  a 
percent decrease in the expected rate of return on plan assets from percent to percent would have increased annual pension expense by million 
for postretirement benefits  a one percent increase in the health care trend rate from percent in grading down to percent in to percent in grading down to percent in would have increased postretirement benefit expense by million
