item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in thousands  except share and per share amounts unless otherwise noted this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations as of december  and for the years ended december  and should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto set forth elsewhere in this report 
this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements  including our expectations of future industry conditions  strategic plans and forecasts of operational results 
various risks may cause our actual results to differ materially 
a list and description of some of the risks and uncertainties is contained below and in the summary of risk factors included in item the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates  which include  among others  those related to collaborative arrangements  property and equipment  income taxes  litigation and other contingencies  materials and supplies  derivatives  intangible assets  and bad debts 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form our basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the impact and any associated risks related to these and our other accounting policies on our business or operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  please refer to our notes to the consolidated financial statements 
there can be no assurance that actual results may not differ from the estimates referred to above 
overview we are a population genetics company developing drugs and dna based diagnostics based upon our discoveries in the inherited causes of common diseases 
our population approach and resources have enabled us to isolate genes and targets directly involved in the development of many of the most common diseases 
we are focused on turning these findings into a growing pipeline of products and services which we believe will be able to combat the causes of disease  not just the signs and symptoms 
our approach to the discovery of healthcare knowledge brings together three key types of non personally identifiable data derived from our population research in iceland 
genotypic and disease data from more than  volunteer participants in some disease gene research programs  and genealogical data linking together the entire present day population of iceland and going back to the settlement of the country in the ninth century 
our business strategy is to leverage our capabilities and assets to create product driven value streams from the near through to the longer term 
our business is divided into two components products and services 
our primary product focus is on the discovery and commercialization of novel therapeutics designed against targets identified in our population based gene discovery work 
through the acquisition in march of medichem life sciences and its subsidiary emerald biostructures  now our pharmaceuticals and biostructures groups  we have integrated capabilities for applying genetic findings to the development of drugs both through our own programs and in alliance with our corporate partners 
our product development activities also encompass the creation of new dna based diagnostics and pharmacogenomics tests  as we apply the links we have identified between genetic variation and disease  and genetic variation and drug response 
we believe such tests will become a standard part of healthcare  making it possible to gauge individual predisposition to a particular disease and to design effective preventive strategies  to complement traditional clinical diagnoses  and to identify patients who are likely to respond or not respond to particular drugs 
we are also marketing bioinformatics software systems developed in the course of our gene and drug target research for making correlations between genetic variation and disease and drug response 
our services include pharmacogenetics and clinical trial services offered through our wholly owned subsidiary encode  contract services in structural biology  medicinal chemistry and scale up into the clinic conducted by our pharmaceuticals group based in chicago  database services  through subscriptions to our clinical genome miner system  integrating anonymized population data with data on disease  genotypes and genealogy  and genotyping services through our laboratory in reykjavik 
we have incurred losses since our inception  principally as a result of research and development and general and administrative expenses in support of our operations 
as of december  we had an accumulated deficit of million 
on the basis of our current range of activities  and following the implementation in september of a plan to reduce costs and maximize the use of automation in our core genetics operations  we anticipate that we will be able to achieve positive cash flow from operations by the end of at the same time  we believe that the initiation of substantial new activities within this timeframe would require additional expenditures that could delay for some time our achievement of positive cash flow from operations 
for example  in our target discovery work on our findings in myocardial infarction and hypertension  we believe we may be able to bypass much of the drug discovery process and enter directly into phase ii clinical trails as early as mid we anticipate incurring additional net losses at least through the next two years  due to  among other factors  depreciation and amortization  as well as stock based compensation and other non cash charges 
we expect that our revenues and losses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that such fluctuations may be substantial  especially because progress in our scientific work and milestone payments that are related to progress can fluctuate between quarters 
we do not believe that comparisons of our quarter to quarter performance are a good indication of future performance 
we believe that current conditions in the global financial markets and in the pharmaceutical industry pose significant near term challenges to biotechnology companies such as ourselves  as well as important opportunities 
the principal challenge to us posed by the downturn in the market valuations of biotechnology companies and of the equity markets more generally is that it restricts our present ability to raise additional capital on favorable terms 
in a very broad sense  it appears that the equity markets are currently more risk averse than they have been in the recent past 
the markets are therefore less willing to ascribe value to companies such as ourselves which  although developing new technologies that may have the potential for generating successful products  are still considered early stage and are not yet profitable 
this is a general trend affecting not only the biotechnology industry but all industries involved in developing new technologies and products that are unproven in the marketplace 
moreover  it is not certain how long this sentiment in the equity markets will last 
in order to mitigate the risk to our product development programs posed by the current conditions in the financial markets  we have implemented measures aimed at preserving our cash resources 
we have implemented a plan to reduce costs to a level that the we anticipate will make it possible to achieve positive cashflow from operations by the end of we believe that we have sufficient cash resources to continue to fund our current research and operations for several years  and we are also investigating the possibility of alternative avenues of financing for our product development programs 
at the same time  the pharmaceutical industry  which is the principal customer base for our gene discovery and contract chemistry businesses  is experiencing difficulties in maintaining historical rates of growth 
this presents near term challenges and significant longer term opportunities 
one of the main challenges facing the pharmaceutical industry is developing pipelines of effective new drugs to treat major indications 
as many leading brand name drugs come off patent and face generic competition  developing successful new medicines will become critical for filling the gap 
in the short term  the financial pressures on pharmaceutical companies may be reflected in their research and development spending  making it more difficult for us to sign corporate alliances with significant upfront funding  or lengthening the time required to negotiate such deals 
this will likely also lead to pressure on budgets for the outsourcing of chemistry services  which are an important source of revenue for us 
we believe that in the medium to longer term  however  companies such as ours may be well positioned to play an important role in filling the gap in the pipeline of new drugs  either on their own or as partners of pharmaceutical companies 
our gene discovery programs are aimed at identifying novel drug targets that are involved in the basic biology of common diseases and we are focused on discovering new drugs against these targets  both on our own and with major pharmaceutical partners 
our partnerships with roche and merck demonstrate that the industry is already investing in the development of new therapeutics based on our approach 
similarly  it is possible that the pharmaceutical industry  in the interest of reducing internal overhead  may opt to increase its outsourcing of contract chemistry services 
collaborations and alliances collaborations and further growth in our medicinal chemistry  pharmacogenomics and informatics services will remain an important element of our business strategy and future revenues 
our ability to generate revenue growth and become profitable is dependent  in part  on our ability to enter into additional collaborative arrangements  and on our ability and our collaborative partners ability to successfully commercialize products incorporating  or based on  our work 
it is also dependent on our ability to maintain and grow our service lines of business 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or expand our existing collaborations  enter into future collaborations to develop applications based on existing or future research agreements  sign additional subscribers to our database services  or successfully expand our medicinal chemistry or pharamacogenetics businesses 
our failure to successfully develop and market products over the next several years  or to realize product revenues  would have a material  or materially adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we do not expect to receive royalties or other revenues from commercial sales of products developed using our technologies in the near term 
it may be several years before product revenues materialize  if they do at all 
we have entered into research  development and commercialization alliances and collaborations with major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies across our business model 
these alliances provide us with varied combinations of fixed funding for research  technology access fees  royalties and milestones 
our partners include merck  wyeth  roche  roche diagnostics and pharmacia 
these agreements are generally established for a set term  usually three to five years 
please refer to item for a summary of our significant collaborations 
acquisitions as part of our business strategy  we continue to consider joint development programs and merger and acquisition opportunities that may provide us with products in late stage development  intellectual property or financial resources  or with capabilities that will help accelerate our downstream drug discovery efforts 
medichem on march   we acquired medichem life sciences  inc in a stock for stock exchange accounted for as a purchase transaction 
the acquisition of medichem is a central element in our strategy to transform decode from a company focused on gene discovery into a biopharmaceutical company capable of creating and capturing the greatest possible value from its discovery capabilities 
the acquisition has benefited us in three ways enabling us to advance our in house programs in drug discovery  enabling us to negotiate much more favorable terms in our alliances with pharmaceutical companies  in which we take our discoveries much further down the drug development process and receive a more significant share of revenues from sales of products that are developed  and providing us with a service business generating revenue in the short term and maintaining the infrastructure for conducting drug discovery work on several programs at once 
through the acquisition we added approximately new employees and facilities in illinois and washington 
the total consideration for the acquisition was approximately million  which consists of decode common stock issued in exchange for outstanding medichem common stock million  medichem employee stock options assumed million and decode transaction costs million 
we have recorded the transaction as a purchase for accounting purposes and have allocated the purchase price  based upon independent valuations  to the assets purchased and liabilities assumed based upon their respective estimated fair values 
identifiable intangible assets include developed technology  patents  customer and other contracts and agreements that have estimated useful lives ranging from three to ten years 
in the first quarter we recorded a charge to earnings for acquired in process research and development amounting in addition  amortization charges for other identifiable intangibles recorded in the medichem acquisition will amount to approximately million annually 
under sfas no 
 resulting goodwill million will not be amortized but is subject to annual impairment testing refer below 
our consolidated financial statements include the cash flows and results of medichem from march  the integration of medichem has impacted and will continue to impact our results of operations and our financial position 
with medichem  our revenues have increased and will increase but our operating expenses have increased and will further increase and  at least for the near term  likely our net losses will increase 
in addition  we expect to continue to fund the working capital needs and operating activities of medichem in the near term 
the extent to which medichem will ultimately impact our results of operations and financial condition is largely dependant upon how much of medichem s existing contract services business is maintained and developed and the extent that medichem s capacity is used in proprietary programs we are working on with partners or alone 
our statements of operations include the results of medichem from march   the date of acquisition 
the following unaudited pro forma financial information presents our consolidated results as if the acquisition of medichem occurred at the beginning of nonrecurring charges  such as the acquired in process research and development charge of is not reflected in the following pro forma financial information but medichem s restructuring and impairment charges totaling  in are included 
this pro forma information is not intended to be indicative of future operating results 
for the year ended december  in thousands  except per share amounts total revenues   net loss   basic and diluted net loss per share termination of agreements with applied biosystems group in the fourth quarter of  we terminated and entered into a related settlement agreement regarding two agreements with applied biosystems group abg that have been in place since july our accounting policy for the joint development and commercialization agreement the agreement with abg to develop genotypic analysis products provides for revenue related to abg s payment obligation and our development costs associated with the agreement to be deferred until the development efforts are completed or the agreement is terminated  if earlier  as was the case 
as a result  deferred revenue and costs of million and million at september   respectively  were recognized in the fourth quarter of when the parties reached agreement as to termination 
at the same time  we reached agreement with abg as to the termination of its reagent supply agreement which required us to make certain minimum purchases on a quarterly basis 
settlement of the reagent s supply agreement had no impact on our consolidated financial results 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates  which include  among others  those related to collaborative arrangements  property and equipment  income taxes  litigation and other contingencies  materials and supplies  derivatives  intangible assets  and bad debts 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form our basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the impact and any associated risks related to these and our other accounting policies on our business or operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  please refer to our notes to the consolidated financial statements 
there can be no assurance that actual results may not differ from the estimates referred to above 
collaborations and revenue 
our collaborative arrangements and the recognition of revenue in such arrangements is the accounting policy most critical to us 
we have formed and will continue to form strategic alliances with collaborative partners 
these agreements will consist of a variety of disease focused programs under which we have or will conduct research funded by our partners  form alliances that combine the transfer of intellectual property with collaborative research and or development in respect of a specific disease  therapeutic or diagnostic approach  and license intellectual property developed as a result of our proprietary research and development 
currently a substantial portion of our revenues relate to funded research collaborations 
under these arrangements  we perform research in a specific disease area or disease areas aimed at discoveries leading to novel pharmaceutical and diagnostic products 
these arrangements generally have fixed terms and renewal periods specific to each agreement 
under these agreements we are entitled to receive committed payments for which we recognize revenue over the term of the associated contract  inclusive of renewal periods to which the company is contractually bound 
in addition  we generally receive contractually agreed milestone payments upon the achievement of specific research and product development milestones 
we recognize milestones when acknowledgement of having achieved applicable performance requirements is received 
we record revenue earned from our research contracts in accordance with the applicable performance requirements and terms of our various contracts  that is  when payment becomes contractually due 
milestone revenue is recognized upon the achievement of milestones 
revenue associated with non refundable up front fees is generally recognized as contract research costs are incurred 
revenue recorded is a focal metric for us as it is  we believe  an important measure of value we create in a given reporting period 
as such  we discuss both revenue recognized under gaap in our income statement and revenue recorded to our balance sheet in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and elsewhere in this annual report 
given the nature of some of our contractual obligations  we may invoice in advance of the work being completed or we may be required to recognize revenue under gaap in advance of being contractually permitted to invoice for our services 
revenue invoiced in advance of satisfying the applicable criteria for revenue recognition remains as deferred revenue in our balance sheet at any reporting date and then is recognized a revenue as we provide the related services 
revenue recognized prior to the time we are contractually entitled to invoice is reported as unbilled costs and fees 
in considering whether to recognize unbilled revenues we assess the likelihood of successfully fulfilling our obligations under the arrangement as well as the risk of collection 
we are also entitled to royalties or profit sharing under the terms of our agreements 
due to the extended time period for the development and commercialization of a saleable product or therapy  we have not yet received royalties or profit sharing under any of our contracts 
although we currently depend upon funded research arrangements for a significant portion of our revenue  we continue to invest in proprietary research and we will incur the costs of such research 
in the near term  this will require us to continue to make investments in our in house capabilities for downstream development which we believe will better position us to capture the most value to us in our discoveries 
as we identify promising discoveries for further development  we may choose to continue the development ourselves into and through clinical trials  regulatory clearances and manufacture  distribution and marketing 
in other cases we are or will be working to varying degrees with partners 
moving from primarily funded research activities to more proprietary research activities will  we believe  increase the potential reward to us from our research 
in doing so  we may trade off an amount of revenue guaranteed for the short term ie  research funding that would go to support these activities 
we will make these decisions with the view of increasing our stake in the long term value of our discoveries while at the same time carefully managing utilization of our cash resources 
other 
we consider certain other accounting matters related to property and equipment  foreign exchange transactions  income taxes and litigation and other contingencies to also be important policies for us 
long lived assets 
we periodically review property and equipment for potential impairments and to assess whether their service lives have been affected by continued technological change and development 
in september of  we implemented a cost reduction program aimed at achieving positive operating cashflow from existing operations by the end of in this regard  we reduced total worldwide headcount by approximately employees during  focusing in particular on utilizing ongoing process automation and increased productivity in the core genetics operations in reykjavik 
stemming from this initiative and together with our consideration of significant and pervasive declines in the market environment for pharmaceutical and biotech industries  we determined that impairment tests of the carrying value of our goodwill and other long lived assets  including the long lived assets acquired through the medichem acquisition  should be performed 
we have completed these tests and recorded impairments and write downs of long term assets amounting to  for the year ended december  should we determine that there has been further impairment of our fixed assets  goodwill or other intangible assets we would again suffer an increase to our net loss or a reduction of our net income in the period such a determination is made 
in  we reduced the service lives of our gene sequencing machines from five years to four years to better reflect our estimate of the service lives of these machines resulting in an increase to depreciation expense of million in that year 
should we determine that the pace of technological change or other matters dictate that we change the estimated service lives of other of our assets  there will be an impact on depreciation expense from the date of the change 
materials and supplies 
we value our materials and supplies at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined on the first in  first out method 
we apply judgment in determining necessary provisions for slow moving  excess and obsolete materials and supplies based on historical experience and anticipated usage  giving effect to general market conditions 
any rapid technological changes or future business developments could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete materials and supplies on hand 
furthermore  if our estimates of our needs for materials and supplies prove to be inaccurate  additional provision may be required for incremental excess and obsolete items 
foreign exchange transactions 
our functional currency is the us dollar 
however  in light of the significance of our operations outside the united states  an important element of our cost base is or will be denominated in icelandic krona  including much of our payroll and other operating expenses and some of our long term borrowings 
to manage our exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates  we have entered into and will likely continue to enter into derivative instruments to hedge our exposure to such fluctuations 
we have entered into interest rate and foreign currency risk arising from long term debt obligations denominated in icelandic krona 
these interest rate and cross currency swaps are designated as economic hedges of fixed rate foreign currency debt  but do not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas at each reporting date  the estimated fair value of these instruments is recorded on our balance sheet and the resulting unrealized gain or loss is included as an other non operating income or expense in our statements of operations 
we estimate the fair value of these instruments using information that is available at the time of such determination  however  the financial markets for these instruments are immature and  as a result  there is significant judgment inherent in the estimating process 
consequently  subsequent changes in the market for such instruments and or our views with respect to such and the estimate of the fair value of these instruments could materially affect our results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period 
income taxes 
the preparation of financial statements requires us to evaluate the positive and negative evidence bearing upon the realizability of our deferred tax assets resulting from deductible operating losses and other items 
due primarily to our history of operating losses and the expectation that such losses will continue into the foreseeable future  we have concluded that currently is insufficient positive evidence exists to justify the recognition of our net deferred tax assets in our balance sheet 
although there can be no assurance that losses generated to date will be used to offset future taxable income  an adjustment to the valuation of our current net deferred tax assets in the future would increase income in the period that we made a determination that such an adjustment was appropriate 
income tax in iceland is payable in icelandic krona 
consequently  the us dollar value of our net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets and liabilities is subject to fluctuations in exchange rates 
such fluctuations over time may increase or reduce the reported us dollar balance of our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and there would be a corresponding gain or loss reported in our income statement 
litigation and other contingencies 
we consider litigation and other claims and potential claims or contingencies in preparing our financial statements under generally accepted accounting principles 
we maintain accruals for litigation and other contingencies when we believe a loss to be probable and reasonably estimated 
we base our accruals on information available at the time of such determination 
although we are party to litigation and other actual or potential claims  our legal counsel and we are unable to estimate the probability of an unfavorable outcome or estimate any resulting loss 
consequently  we have not included an accrual for such costs in our financial statements 
changes or developments in the relevant action or our strategy in such proceedings could materially affect our results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period 
since the recognition of a loss is dependent upon factors not completely in the control of management  timing of a charge  if any  is difficult to predict with certainty 
results of operations from the years ended december   and our results of operations have fluctuated from period to period and may continue to fluctuate in the future based upon  among other things  the timing and composition of funding under our various collaborative agreements  as well as the progress of our own research and development efforts and how quickly and in what proportion medichem s now our pharmaceuticals and biostructures groups capacity is brought to bear on our in house programs 
results of operations for any period may be unrelated to results of operations for any other period 
in addition  historical results should not be viewed as indicative of future operating results 
we are subject to risks common to companies in our industry and at our stage of development  including risks inherent in our research and development efforts  reliance upon collaborative partners  development by us or our competitors of new technological innovations  ability to market products or services  dependence on key personnel  dependence on key suppliers  protection of proprietary technology  ability to obtain additional financing  ability to negotiate collaborative arrangements  and compliance with governmental and other regulations 
in order for a product to be commercialized based on our research  we and our collaborators must conduct preclinical tests and clinical trials  demonstrate the efficacy and safety of our product candidates  obtain regulatory approvals or clearances and enter into manufacturing  distribution and marketing arrangements  as well as obtain market acceptance 
we do not expect to receive revenues or royalties based on therapeutic or diagnostic products for a period of years  if at all 
revenue 
our revenues from research and development collaboration agreements are recorded and recognized in accordance with the applicable performance requirements and terms of the respective contracts  generally either i as contract research costs are incurred  usually ratably over the period of effort  ii according to the percentage of completion method of contract accounting based on the ratio of contract research costs incurred to expected total costs  or iii upon the achievement of substantive milestones 
funding payments are not refundable in the event that the related efforts are not successful 
non refundable  up front payments we receive are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the contract term 
our contracted chemistry services revenue from negotiated rate contracts are recognized on a per diem basis as services are rendered or on the percentage of completion method based on the ratio of costs incurred to expected total costs for fixed fee contracts based upon the terms of the underlying contract 
any losses on contracts are provided for when they are determinable 
included in revenue are billings to customers for the cost of materials purchased by us under the contract 
prior to january   we recorded all milestone payments received when acknowledgement of having achieved applicable performance requirements was received from the collaborator and we recognized milestone payments as revenue on a retrospective basis over the contractual term of the underlying agreement 
we believe the milestone payment method to be a preferable method in recognizing revenue for milestone payments made under particular contracts in that it more closely relates to the underlying activity that results in the revenue generating milestone event under such contracts 
effective january   we changed our method of recognizing milestone revenue to the milestone payment method for contracts where i the milestone event is substantive  ii there is substantial effort involved in achieving the milestone  iii the milestone payment amount is commensurate with the magnitude of the related achievement  and iv the associated follow on revenue streams bear a reasonable relationship to one another 
under the milestone payment method we record revenue when the milestone has been achieved and payment is due and payable under the terms of the respective agreement and we recognize revenue when acknowledgement of having achieved applicable performance requirements is received from the collaborator 
as before  milestone payments without the above characteristics are recognized on a retrospective basis over the contractual term of the underlying agreement 
the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle on prior years results of is included in income in the year ended december  had the retrospective basis of milestone revenue recognition been continued for the year ended december   revenue  net loss and basic and diluted net loss per share would have been   and  respectively 
the following is a summary of deferred revenue for the year ended december  in thousands revenue recorded during the year    revenue recognized during the year    deferred revenue recorded on acquisition of medichem cumulative effect of change in milestone revenue recognition policy deferred revenue at beginning of year    deferred revenue at end of year    our revenues increased to  for the year ended december  as compared to  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in is attributable to the addition of research funding under the collaboration with merck  and to the addition of decode s recently acquired pharmaceuticals and biostructures groups  offset by the recognition of revenue from milestone achievements under the research collaboration with roche during that did not recur in the  or increase in total revenues from to principally resulted from the recognition of revenue from new milestone achievements under our research collaboration with roche but also from the new diagnostics collaboration with roche 
we expect that our revenues will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that such fluctuations may be substantial especially because progress in our scientific work  including milestone payments that are related to progress  can fluctuate between quarters 
at december   the total amount of deferred research revenue that will be recognized in future periods aggregated  revenues recorded increased to  for the year ended december  as compared to  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we recorded significant revenues in principally as a result of the then new diagnostics collaboration with roche and also milestone achievements under our research collaboration with roche 
revenue recorded in includes access fees and research funding under the alliance with merck  as well as access fees and research funding under the therapeutics and diagnostics collaborations with roche and the revenues recorded by our recently acquired pharmaceuticals and biostructures groups 
the  or increase in recorded revenues from to is principally attributable to our then new diagnostics collaboration with roche and other collaborations  but also results from greater milestone achievements under our research collaboration with roche 
research and development  including cost of revenue 
our research and development expenses increased to  for the year ended december  as compared to  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in as compared to reflects spending related to the range of our disease gene research programs and the initiation of downstream work on targets already identified as well as the addition of our newly acquired pharmaceutical and biostructures groups from march the  or increase in research and development expenses from to is primarily attributable to depreciation on the expanded asset base and increased usage of consumables in support of  among other things  our new abi prism dna analyzers  salaries and contractor services  and the disposal of laboratory equipment 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expenses were  for the year ended december  as compared to  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in as compared to results from expanded sales efforts across our businesses and from the addition of selling  general and administrative costs of our pharmaceutical and biostructures groups from march offset somewhat by a one time  non cash litigation settlement in without regard to the litigation settlement charge in  million of stock based contributions in  and stock based compensation and remuneration charges both periods  general and administrative expense increased approximately million or from to as a result of added salaries  contractor services and other general and administrative expenses in the expansion of our operations 
stock based compensation and remuneration expense 
stock based compensation and remuneration expense decreased to  for the year ended december  as compared to  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
with little compensation expense being attributed to our more recent stock option grants  stock based compensation and remuneration expense has been decreasing as grants made to employees in earlier years become fully vested 
historical stock based compensation and remuneration is not necessarily representative of the effects on reported income or loss for future years due to  among other things  the vesting period of the stock options  the value of stock options that have been granted in recent times and the value of additional options that may be granted in future years 
impairment  employee termination benefits and other costs 
in september of  we implemented a cost reduction program aimed at achieving positive operating cashflow from existing operations by the end of in this regard  we reduced total worldwide headcount  focusing in particular on utilizing ongoing process automation and increased productivity in the core genetics operations in reykjavik 
stemming from this initiative and together with our consideration of significant and pervasive declines in the market environment for pharmaceutical and biotech industries  we determined that impairment tests of the carrying value of our goodwill and other long lived assets  including the long lived assets acquired through the medichem acquisition  should be performed 
we have recorded the following impairment  employee termination benefits and other charges in the year ended december  in thousands employee termination benefits  impairment of goodwill  impairment of property and intangible asset  write down of assets held for sale  write down of equipment  obsolete and excess materials and supplies  charges related to termination benefits are for employees 
of the  provided   was paid in the fourth quarter and remains accrued and unpaid as of december  these remaining benefits are expected to be settled in cash over the first quarter for purposes of the goodwill impairment tests  we identified our reporting units  identified the assets and liabilities of the reporting units and performed impairment tests on the net goodwill associated with them 
goodwill that resulted from the acquisition of medichem was assigned to the reporting units based upon expectations of synergies to be gained from the integration of the pharmaceutical and biostructures groups with the overall group 
goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
to identify potential impairment  we compare fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
for this purpose  we estimate fair value of a reporting unit using analyses of comparable companies and recent comparable transactions 
in measuring the amount of impairment loss  we compare the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill  estimating the fair value of an impaired reporting unit using discounted cash flow methodologies 
the goodwill impairment charge is associated solely with goodwill resulting from the acquisition of medichem and results largely from significant and pervasive declines in the market environment for the pharmaceutical and biotech industries impacting  among other things  market valuations of companies operating in those industries 
in september  we committed to a plan to sell our woodridge discovery center and an agent was engaged and has initiated an active marketing program to locate a buyer investor in a sale and leaseback transaction 
efforts to enter into a sale and leaseback transaction continue with a view to having a re financing being completed by mid taking into account the estimated selling price of the building  we recorded an impairment charge in the year ended december  amounting to  in addition  certain intangible assets amounting to were determined to be impaired utilizing a discounted cashflow methodology to estimate fair value 
in september  we committed to a plan to sell our former headquarters facility that had been vacated in connection with the move to our new headquarters facility in reykjavik s university district earlier in the year 
in october  an agent for the sale was engaged and an active marketing program to locate a buyer was initiated 
in november  terms of sale were agreed and executed with a buyer in the amount of  taking into account the selling price of the building less costs to sell  we wrote down the property in september amounting to  in september  we wrote down the value of certain laboratory equipment no longer in use  amounting to  ongoing process automation and increased productivity in the core genetics operations in reykjavik and changes in some of our target research programs have affected planned volume and timing of usage of materials and supplies 
in this connection  we recorded a writedown for excess and obsolete materials and supplies during september interest income 
our interest income was  for the year ended december  as compared to  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in general  the decreased returns are attributable to the decline of prevailing interest rates but also from an overall decrease in our cash balance as we utilize the proceeds of our initial public offering for operations 
interest expense 
our interest expense was  for the year ended december  as compared to and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in interest expense for reflects the cost of financings put into place during the late part of and early part of other non operating income and expense  net 
our other non operating income and expense  net decreased to a net expense of for the year ended december  as compared to a net expense of  and a net income of  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our other non operating income and expense  net is principally comprised of our share in the earnings losses of emr  foreign exchange differences and unrealized swap gains and losses 
the weakening of the us dollar compared to the icelandic krona during has been significant and these currency fluctuations may continue to adversely affect our financial results 
income taxes 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of  and did not owe any icelandic or us federal income taxes nor did we pay any in the years ended december   or realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future earnings  if any

net loss and basic and diluted net loss per share were  and  respectively  for the year ended december  as compared to  and  respectively  for the year ended december  and  and  respectively  for the year ended december  this is an increase of in net loss and an increase of in basic and diluted net loss per share from to and an increase of in net loss and a decrease of in basic and diluted net loss per share from to the increases in net loss and basic and diluted net loss per share in are primarily attributable to the impairment  employee termination benefits and other charges recorded offset in part by the higher average number of shares outstanding for the periods 
the difference in the average number of shares outstanding is the result of our acquisition of medichem in march pro forma net loss and basic and diluted net loss per share 
net loss and basic and diluted net loss per share were  and  respectively  for the year ended december  as compared to pro forma net loss and basic and diluted net loss per share calculated assuming our new milestone revenue recognition method is applied retroactively of  and  respectively  for the year ended december  and of  and  respectively  for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations primarily through funding from collaborative agreements and the issuance of equity securities and debt instruments 
from the beginning of to date  we have received cash of approximately million from collaborative research agreements  million from the issuance of common stock  million from the issuance of preferred stock and warrants  and million from privately placed bonds  bank loans and equipment financing

available cash is invested in accordance with our investment policy s primary objectives of liquidity  safety of principal and diversity of investments 
our cash is deposited only with financial institutions in iceland  the united kingdom and the united states having a high credit standing 
this cash is largely invested in us dollar denominated money market and checking accounts and also in icelandic krona denominated accounts 
operating activities 
working capital needs resulted in the net use of  of funds in the year ended december  as compared to  that was provided by working capital sources in the year ended december  on account of this and significant non cash impairment and other charges in  although net loss increased  in as compared to  net cash used in operating activities increased  in as compared to notably  in we made significant payments to our vendors and particularly to abg for reagents  other supplies and dna analyzers 
in addition  and as more fully discussed above  we have particularly continued to make significant investments in our disease gene research programs and have taken on the costs of downstream work on targets already identified as well as have expanded our sales efforts across our businesses 
on the basis of our current range of activities  and following the implementation of a plan to reduce headcount and maximize the use of automation in our core genetics operations  we anticipate that we will be able to achieve positive cashflow from operations by the end of at the same time  we believe that the initiation of possible substantial new activities within this timeframe  such as clinical trials of a drug against one of our proprietary targets  would require additional expenditures that could delay for some time our achievement of positive cashflow from operations 
investing activities 
our investing activities have consisted of capital expenditures and long term strategic equity investments in  and acquisitions of  technologies and businesses that are complementary to our business 
purchases of property and equipment during the year ended december  were  as compared to  and  in the years ended december  and  respectively  primarily due to the expansion of our facilities and operations

during  we expended million in respect of our new headquarters building and we paid million for dna analyzers acquired late in cash acquired in the purchase of medichem was million and we paid million of transaction costs  resulting in a net cash outlay for in connection with the acquisition of net cash used in investing activities may in the future fluctuate significantly from period to period due to the timing of our capital expenditures and other investments

in addition  we repaid the existing mortgage on our woodridge  il discovery center million and re financed the property in june  resulting in proceeds of million 
net cash provided by financing activities in was principally due to the financing of certain equipment and of our new headquarters facility and  as a result  installment payments on capital lease obligations have increased in we expect to continue to finance future property and equipment purchases through similar such leasing arrangements 
net cash provided by financing activities in was largely due to approximately million of net proceeds from our july initial public offering 
in december  we established a million bridge loan with an icelandic financial institution to finance the construction of our new headquarters facility

these outstanding contracts bear annual interest of three month libor plus and twelve month libor plus  respectively 
in connection with the tier c bonds and the tier d bank loan  we issued a warrant giving the holder the right to purchase a total of  shares of our common stock at per share  as adjusted 
the warrants expire in march and convert into shares of our common stock automatically in the event the market value of a share of our common stock should exceed for thirty consecutive days of trading

our contractual commitments as of december  were as follows payments due by period less than due total year years years thereafter in thousands long term debt      capital lease obligations  including interest    operating leases    icelandic health sector database license     general 
following the implementation in september of a plan to reduce headcount and maximize the use of automation in our core genetics operations and based upon current plans  we believe that our existing resources will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for several years 
our cash requirements depend on numerous factors  including our ability to obtain new research collaboration agreements  to obtain subscription and collaboration agreements for the database services  to obtain and maintain contract service agreements in our chemistry services and clinical research trials groups  expenditures in connection with alliances  license agreements and acquisitions of and investments in complementary technologies and businesses  competing technological and market developments  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the purchase of additional capital equipment  including capital equipment necessary to ensure that our sequencing and genotyping operations remain competitive  and capital expenditures required to expand our facilities 
changes in our research and development plans  the entry into clinical trials of a drug based on our discoveries  or other changes affecting our operating expenses may result in changes in the timing and amount of expenditures of our capital resources 
we will require significant additional capital in the future  which we may seek to raise through further public or private equity offerings  additional debt financing or added collaborations and licensing arrangements 
no assurance can be given that additional financing or collaborations and licensing arrangements will be available when needed  or that if available  will be obtained on favorable terms 
if adequate funds are not available when needed  we may have to curtail operations or attempt to raise funds on unattractive terms

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities in our investment portfolio may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the market value of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the market value of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk in the future  we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds and government and non government debt securities 
in general  money market funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
as of december   all of our cash and cash equivalents were in money market and checking accounts 
we are exposed to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and investment prices 
these changes may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
we seek to manage these risks through regular operating and financing activities and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
we control and manage foreign exchange risk  interest rate risk  and investment price risk by continually monitoring changes in key economic indicators and market information 
as a consequence of the nature our business and operations our reported financial results and cash flows are exposed to the risks associated with fluctuations in the exchange rates of the us dollar  the icelandic krona and other world currencies 
we continue to monitor our exposure to currency risk but have not yet purchased instruments to hedge these general risks through the use of derivative financial instruments 
we hold various interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities to manage the liquidity and cash needs of our day to day operations 
as a result  we are exposed to risks due to changes in interest rates 
in order to mitigate risks associated with interest rate sensitive liabilities we use interest rate derivative instruments  such as cross currency interest rate swaps  and may in future use other instruments to achieve the desired interest rate maturities and asset liability structures 
we are exposed to credit or repayment risk  as well as market risk from the use of derivative instruments 
if the counterparty fails to fulfill its performance obligations under a derivative contract  our credit risk will equal the positive market value in a derivative 
consequently  when the fair market value of a derivative contract is positive  this indicates that the counterparty owes us  thus creating a repayment risk for us 
when the fair market value of a derivative contract is negative  we owe the counterparty and therefore  assume no repayment risk 
in order to minimize the credit risk in derivative instruments  we enter into transactions with high quality counterparties such as financial institutions that satisfy our established credit approval criteria 
we review the credit ratings of such counterparties on a regular basis
