a variety of risks such as schedule delays  cancellations  and changes in customer markets and economic conditions can adversely affect a design win before production is reached or during deployment

fin in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
interpretation no 
requires companies with a variable interest entity to apply this guidance to that entity as of the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  for existing interests and immediately for new interests 
the application of the guidance could result in the consolidation of a variable interest entity 
the only variable interest entity of the company is its investment in momentum computer  inc disclosed in note f 
the company is evaluating the impact of this interpretation on financial results 
critical accounting estimates and assumptions in preparing the financial statements in accordance with gaap  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that have an impact on the assets  liabilities  revenue and expense amounts reported 
these estimates can also affect supplemental information disclosures by the company  including information about contingencies  risk and financial condition 
the company believes  given current facts and circumstances  its estimates and assumptions are reasonable  adhere to gaap  and are consistently applied 
inherent in the nature of an estimate or assumption is the fact that actual results may differ from estimates  and estimates may vary as new facts and circumstances arise 
the critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates  which management believes have the most significant effect on the financial statements are set forth below o revenue recognition o software development costs o valuation of inventory revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue in accordance with the sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been provided  the sale price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
additionally  the company sells its products on terms  which transfer title and risk of loss at a specified location  typically shipping point 
accordingly  revenue recognition from product sales occurs when all factors are met  including transfer of title and risk of loss  which generally occurs upon shipment by the company 
revenue earned from arrangements for software systems requiring significant production  modification  or customization of software is recognized over the contract period as performance milestones are fulfilled 
if all conditions of revenue recognition are not met  the company defers revenue recognition 
revenue from consulting and other services is recognized at the time the services are rendered 
any anticipated losses on contracts are charged to operations as soon as such losses are determined 
revenue from software maintenance contracts is recognized ratably over the contractual period 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to revenue recognition is a critical accounting estimate because the company s terms of sale can vary  and management exercises judgment in determining whether to defer revenue recognition 
such judgments may materially affect net sales for any period 
management exercises judgment within the parameters of gaap in determining when contractual obligations are met  title and risk of loss are transferred  sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
software development costs all software development costs incurred in establishing the technological feasibility of computer software products to be sold are research and development costs 
software development costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility of a computer software product to be sold and prior to general release of that product are capitalized 
amounts capitalized are amortized commencing after general release of that product over the estimated remaining economic life of that product  generally three years  or using the ratio of current revenues to current and anticipated revenues from such product  whichever provides greater amortization 
if in the judgment of management  technological feasibility for a particular project has not been met or recoverability of amounts capitalized is in doubt  project costs are expensed as research and development or charged to costs of goods sold  as applicable 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to software development costs is a critical accounting estimate because the company s management exercises judgment in determining whether project costs are expensed as research and development 
such judgments may materially affect expense amounts for any period 
management exercises judgment within the parameters of gaap in determining when technological feasibility has been met and recoverability of software development costs is reasonably assured 
valuation of inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  using the first in  first out method 
the company s inventory includes purchased parts and components  work in process and finished goods 
the company provides inventory reserves for excess  obsolete or slow moving inventory after periodic evaluation of historical sales  current economic trends  forecasted sales  estimated product lifecycles and estimated inventory levels 
the factors that contribute to inventory valuation risks are the company s purchasing practices  electronic component obsolescence  accuracy of sales and production forecasts  introduction of new products  product lifecycles and the associated product support 
the company manages its exposure to inventory valuation risks by maintaining safety stocks  minimum purchase lots  managing product end of life issues brought on by aging components or new product introductions  and by utilizing certain inventory minimization strategies such as vendor managed inventories 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to valuation of inventories is a critical accounting estimate because it is susceptible to changes from period to period due to the requirement for management to make estimates relative to each of the underlying factors ranging from purchasing  to sales  to production  to after sale support 
if actual demand  market conditions or product lifecycles are adversely different from those estimated by management  inventory adjustments to lower market values would result in a reduction to the carrying value of inventory  an increase in inventory write offs and a decrease to gross margins 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to various market risks in the normal course of business  primarily interest rate risk  canadian currency fluctuation risk and changes in the market value of its investments  and believes its exposure to such risk is minimal 
the company s investments are made in accordance with the company s investment policy and primarily consist of us treasury securities  municipal securities and corporate obligations 
the company does not participate in the investment of derivative financial instruments
