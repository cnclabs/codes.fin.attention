except for historical information  the discussion in this report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  including the risks described in the section titled risk factors beginning on page overview packeteer is a leading provider of application traffic management systems designed to enable enterprises to gain visibility and control for networked applications  extend network resources and align application performance with business priorities

our products are built on hardware platforms based on intel compatible microprocessor technologies 
in addition  packetwise software is licensed by major communications industry partners who integrate the software into specific strategic networking solutions 
we primarily use indirect channels  resellers  distributors and system integrators  to leverage the reach of our sales force and to obtain worldwide coverage 
our sales and marketing efforts are used to develop brand awareness and support our indirect channels 
we have subsidiaries or branch offices in australia  canada  caymans  denmark  france  germany  hong kong  japan  singapore  south korea  the netherlands  and the united kingdom 
to date  we have shipped more than  units 
we were incorporated in january from our inception through january  our operating activities related primarily to establishing a research and development organization  developing and testing prototype designs  establishing a sales and marketing organization and developing customer  vendor and manufacturing relationships 
we shipped our first product in february since then  we have focused on developing additional products and product enhancements  building our worldwide indirect sales channel and establishing our sales  marketing and customer support organizations 
in order to further the growth of our business  we sold  shares of common stock in our initial public offering on july   which raised approximately million net of fees and expenses 
we have a limited operating history 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we achieved profitability throughout fiscal however  as we incurred losses since we commenced operations in until  continued profitability could be difficult to sustain 
we expect to continue to incur significant sales and marketing  product development and administrative expenses and  as a result  will need to generate significant quarterly revenues to maintain profitability 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and 
table of contents related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to inventory valuation  valuation of long lived assets  valuation allowances including sales return reserves and allowance for doubtful accounts  and other liabilities  specifically warranty reserves 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the items in our financial statements requiring the most significant estimates and judgment are as follows revenue recognition 
product revenue consists primarily of sales of our packetshaper and appcelera products  which include hardware  as well as software licenses 
service revenue consists primarily of maintenance revenue and  to a lesser extent  training revenue 
the company applies the provisions of statement of position  software revenue recognition  as amended by statement of position  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  to all transactions involving the sale of hardware and software products 
revenue is generally recognized when all of the following criteria are met as set forth in paragraph of sop persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
receipt of a customer purchase order is persuasive evidence of an arrangement 
sales through our distribution channel are evidenced by an agreement governing the relationship together with purchase orders on a transaction by transaction basis 
delivery generally occurs when product is delivered to a common carrier from packeteer or its designated fulfillment house 
for maintenance contracts  delivery is deemed to occur ratably over the contract period 
the company s fees are typically considered to be fixed or determinable at the inception of the arrangements and are negotiated at the outset of an arrangement  generally based on specific products and quantities to be delivered 
in the event payment terms are provided that differ significantly from our standard business practices  the fees are deemed to not be fixed or determinable and revenue is recognized as the fees become due and payable 
we assess collectibility based on a number of factors  including credit worthiness of the customer and past transaction history of the customer 
our standard revenue recognition policy includes modifications under certain circumstances as follows product revenue on sales to major new distributors is recorded based on sell through to the end user customers until such time as the company has established significant experience with the distributor s product exchange activity 
additionally  when the company introduces a new product into its distribution channel for which there is no historical customer demand or acceptance history  revenue is recognized on the basis of sell through to end user customers until such time as demand or acceptance history has been established 
the company has analyzed all of the elements included in its multiple element arrangements and has determined that it has sufficient vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value to allocate revenue to the maintenance component of its product and to training 
vsoe is based upon separate sales of maintenance renewals and training to customers 
accordingly  assuming other revenue recognition criteria are met  revenue from product sales is recognized upon delivery using the residual method in accordance with sop revenue from maintenance is recognized ratably over the maintenance term 
table of contents and revenue from training is recognized when the training has taken place 
to date  training revenues have not been material 
inventory valuation 
inventories consist primarily of finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost on a first in  first out basis or market 
we currently contract with smtc for the manufacture of all of our products 
we record inventory reserves for excess and obsolete inventories based on historical usage and forecasted demand 
factors which could cause our forecasted demand to prove inaccurate include our reliance on indirect sales channels and the variability of our sales cycle  the potential of announcements of our new products or enhancements to replace or shorten the life cycle of our current products  or cause customers to defer their purchases  loss of sales due to product shortages  and the potential of new or alternative technologies achieving widespread market acceptance and thereby rendering our existing products obsolete 
if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections  additional inventory write downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
as required by sfas  accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the company regularly performs reviews to determine if the carrying value of its long lived assets is impaired 
the purpose for the review is to identify any facts or circumstances  either internal or external  which indicate that the carrying value of the assets cannot be recovered 
such facts or circumstances might include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results or significant negative industry or economic trends 
if such indicators are present  we determine whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets in question is less than their carrying value 
if less  we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values 
if quoted market prices for assets are not available  the fair value is estimated based on the present value of expected future cash flows 
the fair value of the asset then becomes the asset s new carrying value 
during the third quarter of  the company performed an assessment of the carrying value of the goodwill and other intangible assets related to its acquisition of workfire technologies international  inc pursuant to the company s stated policy as described in note to the financial statements 
management s determination of the existence of impairment indicators included continued general economic slowing  broad based declines in the values of networking technologies and a review of current  historical and future projections of cash flows related to these assets 
the conclusion of the assessment was a determination that the carrying value of the goodwill and other intangible assets exceeded its fair value 
the fair value was determined based on company projections of the present value of future net cash flows to be generated over the expected lives of these assets 
accordingly  the company recorded an impairment charge of million during the third quarter of for the entire unamortized balance 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
changes the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
any goodwill or other intangible assets recorded in the future will be tested for impairment on an annual basis according to the specific guidance in the statement 
sales return reserve and allowance for doubtful accounts 
in accordance with sfas  revenue recognition when right of return exists  management must use judgment and make estimates of potential future product returns related to current period product revenue 
when providing for sales return reserves  we analyze historical return rates as they are the primary indicator for estimating future returns 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue if for any period actual returns differ from our judgments or estimates 
the sales return reserve balances at december  and were  and  respectively 
we must also make estimates of the uncollectibility of accounts receivable 
when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts  we review the aged receivables on an account by account basis  taking into consideration such factors as age of the receivables  customer history and estimated continued credit worthiness  as well as general economic and industry trends 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  
table of contents resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances could be required 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was  and  at december  and  respectively 
warranty reserves 
upon shipment of products to our customers  we provide for the estimated cost to repair or replace products that may be returned under warranty 
our warranty period is typically months from the date of shipment to the end user customer 
for existing products  the reserve is estimated based on actual historical experience 
for new products  the warranty reserve is based on historical experience of similar products until such time as sufficient historical data has been collected on the new product 
factors that may impact our warranty costs in the future include our reliance on our contract manufacturer to provide quality products and the fact that our products are complex and may contain undetected defects  errors or failures in either the hardware or the software 
to date  these problems have not materially adversely affected us 
warranty reserves amounted to  and  at december  and  respectively 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain financial data as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated 
these historical operating results are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period 
net revenues product and service costs amortization of acquired technology gross margin operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative amortization of goodwill impairment of goodwill and intangibles amortization of stock based compensation total operating expenses net income loss from operations interest and other income interest and other expense net income loss before income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss net revenues product revenues consist primarily of sales of our packetshaper family of products 
service revenues consist primarily of maintenance revenues and  to a lesser extent  training revenues 
total net revenues increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and from million in fiscal product revenues increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and from million in fiscal the increase in product revenues from to was primarily due to a favorable product mix  as sales of our higher end products continue to represent a higher percentage of our reported revenues 
to a lesser extent  an overall increase in the number of units shipped also 
table of contents contributed to the increase in product revenues 
the increase from to was due to a more favorable product mix  with sales of our packetshaper models  introduced in the fourth quarter of fiscal  showing the largest growth in there were no significant changes in selling prices during any of the periods presented 
service revenues increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and from million in due mainly to increases in the number of units on maintenance contracts 
for fiscal  total net revenues in north america increased to million  from million in fiscal and million in fiscal sales in north america accounted for  and of net revenues for  and  respectively 
net revenues in asia pacific were million  million and million  or  and of net revenues in  and  respectively 
the increase in was due to strong sales in japan 
net revenues in europe  the middle east and africa  emea  of million  million and million  represented  and of net revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
in  sales to three customers  alternative technology  inc  westcon  inc  and macnica  inc 
accounted for  and of net revenues respectively 
in and  one customer  alternative technology  inc  accounted for and of net revenues  respectively 
no other customer accounted for or more of revenues in or sales to the top indirect channel partners accounted for   and of net revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
at december   three customers accounted for of accounts receivable 
despite our belief that world wide economic growth and it spending will remain relatively flat for at least  we believe that our current value proposition  which enables our enterprise customers to get more value out of existing network resources and improved performance of their critical applications should continue to allow us to grow our business again in our growth rate and net revenue depend significantly on continued growth in the application traffic solutions market  our ability to develop and maintain strong partnering relationships with our indirect channel partners and our ability to expand or enhance our product offerings or respond to technological change 
our growth in service revenues is dependent upon increasing the number of products on maintenance  which is dependent on both growing our installed base and renewing existing maintenance contracts 
our future profitability and rate of growth  if any  will be directly affected by the continued acceptance of our product in the marketplace  as well as the timing and size of orders and shipments  product mix  average selling price of our products and general economic conditions 
our failure to successfully convince the market of our value proposition and maintain strong relationships with our indirect channel partners to ensure the success of their selling efforts on our behalf  would adversely impact our net revenues and operating results 
cost of revenues our cost of revenues excluding amortization of acquired technology consists of the cost of finished products purchased from our turnkey contract manufacturer  overhead costs and service support costs 
our cost of revenues decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and increased from million in fiscal the cost of revenues represented  and of net revenues in fiscal   and  respectively 
product costs decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal overhead costs  specifically warranty costs and parts costs  decreased million in fiscal compared to fiscal this was partially offset by an increase in manufacturing costs  due to increased products shipped 
per unit manufacturing costs decreased in  compared to  due to lower component prices 
the increase from to was due to increases in overhead costs  partially offset by reductions in manufacturing and other product costs 
to maintain our gross margins we must continue to develop and introduce on a timely basis new products and enhancements and reduce product costs as we did in although we expect our overhead costs to increase in absolute dollars in future quarters  as a percent of revenues we do not expect them to return to fiscal levels 
service costs remained unchanged at million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and increased from million in fiscal decreased consulting costs in were offset by increased 
table of contents service fees and supplies related to an agreement entered into in the third quarter of for the outsourcing of certain maintenance and support services 
the increases from to are due to the costs of developing the service support organization to support the increased installed base 
prior to fiscal  support activities were handled primarily by the sales organization 
we expect service costs to increase in absolute dollars in future quarters primarily as a result of increased service fees related to the outsourcing of certain maintenance and support services 
amortization of acquired technology amortization of acquired technology relates to the acquired developed technologies of workfire technologies international  inc workfire 
the acquisition occurred in september due to the impairment write off in the third quarter of fiscal  there was no amortization during the current fiscal year 
the amortization of acquired technology was million during and  in research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel expenses  consultant fees and prototype expenses related to the design  development  testing and enhancement of our products and software 
excluding the effects of stock based compensation of   and  for the years  and  respectively  research and development expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and increased from million in fiscal the decreased expenses in were primarily due to a decrease in program related charges  mainly project materials  and to a lesser extent  a reduction in depreciation expense  partially offset by an increase in distributed costs 
distributed costs include expenses related to facilities  communications and technology  which are allocable to all functional areas of the company 
the increase in distributed expenses is discussed below under the heading general and administrative 
the increase in research and development expenses from fiscal to fiscal was due to increases in staffing and related personnel costs  as well as increases in project related materials 
the increase in personnel related expenses was due to the inclusion of workfire for all of fiscal  compared to only three and one half months in fiscal research and development expenses represented  and of net revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
as of december   all research and development costs have been expensed as incurred 
we believe that continued investment in research and development is critical to attaining our strategic product and cost control objectives 
we currently expect to experience somewhat higher spending levels in the upcoming quarters  but continue to target our spending to approximate our current long term business model target of to of revenues going forward 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and related personnel expenses for those engaged in the sales  marketing and support of the product as well as related trade show  promotional and public relations expenses

the increase in distributed costs is discussed below under the heading general and administrative 
the increases in fiscal compared to fiscal reflected the hiring of additional personnel in connection with building our sales force and distribution channels 
sales and marketing expenses represented  and of net revenues for fiscal   and  respectively 
we intend to continue to invest in appropriate sales and marketing campaigns and therefore expect sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollar expenses to increase in the future

table of contents general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel expenses for administrative personnel  professional fees and other general corporate expenses 
excluding the effects of stock based compensation of   and  in  and respectively  general and administrative expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and from million in fiscal for fiscal  decreases in professional services and distributed costs were partially offset by increased personnel costs  primarily related to the ceo transition and search occurring during the second and third quarters of decreases in distributed costs are due to a change in the allocation of the expenses associated with our information technology group it 
prior to fiscal  only a small portion of it costs were allocated out of general and administrative expenses 
beginning in fiscal  based on improved tracking and reporting of it services  a greater portion of it costs were allocated to other departments to better reflect the services performed by this group 
during  approximately  of additional it costs were allocated from general and administrative expenses into cost of revenues  research and development and sales and marketing 
comparable figures for the prior year are not available 
the increase in expenses from to included additional personnel costs and depreciation expenses 
general and administrative expenses represented of net revenues in  and of net revenues for fiscal and this percentage decrease was due to lower expenses as well as increased revenues 
without the change in allocation of it costs  general and administrative expenses would have been of total net revenues in fiscal we expect to see general and administrative expenses continue to decline as a percentage of revenue and expect to reach our long term business model target of to of revenue within the next twelve to eighteen months
