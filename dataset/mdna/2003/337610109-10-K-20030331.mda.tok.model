readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these ii 
table of contents forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date hereof 
we do not intend to update any of the forward looking statements after the date of this release to conform these statements to actual results or to changes in our expectations  except as may be required by law 
critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related notes 
some of these estimates require difficult  subjective and or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and  as a result  actual results may differ from those estimates 
due to the judgment and estimation involved  the following summarized accounting policies and their application are considered to be critical to understanding the business operations  financial condition  and results of operations of the first years 
revenue recognition in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 we recognize revenue when products are shipped or delivered and substantial risks of ownership transfers to the customer  a firm sales agreement is in place  and collectibility of the fixed or determinable sales price is reasonably assured 
common to our industry  customers may be authorized to return selected products and we reduce sales and accounts receivable for actual returns and estimate future returns based on historical trends and information available to us  including the pattern of returns immediately following the reporting period 
we also maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventories inventories  consisting of finished goods  unpackaged components  and supplies  are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined using the first in  first out method 
we make certain obsolescence and other assumptions to adjust inventory based on historical experience and current information 
we write down inventory for estimated obsolete or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the costs of inventory and estimated market value  based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
in the event of a write down of inventory  we also review molds associated with those products to determine whether there has been a significant impairment to the carrying value of the asset 
if the carrying value of these assets is considered not to be recoverable  such assets are written down as appropriate 
these assumptions  although consistently applied  can have a significant impact on current and future operating results and financial position 
sales incentives sales incentives offered to customers to promote the sales of our products include costs related to cooperative advertising programs  promotions  slotting fees or buydowns  and certain rebates 
in determining these costs  we reflect activity and make estimates of certain costs of promotional activity based on historical arrangements and information available to us 
costs associated with sales incentives are reflected as a reduction of revenue when recognized 
for further information concerning accounting policies refer to note of our consolidated financial statements 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  we reported consolidated net sales of million  an increase of million or  as compared to net sales of million in despite general economic weakness and the strength of private label programs in some large retailers  our multi year program to improve product development and marketing processes and organization positively impacted our growth in net sales

liquidity and capital resources we believe our ability to generate cash from operations to reinvest in our business is one of our fundamental financial strengths 
we anticipate that our operating activities in will continue to provide us with cash flows to assist in our business expansion and to meet our financial commitments 
ii 
table of contents our cash and cash equivalents increased to million at december   from million at december  the increase resulted primarily from million provided by operating activities  offset by million and million used in investing and financing activities  respectively 
net cash of million provided by operating activities consisted primarily of million from net income adjusted for non cash items and million provided by changes in working capital and other activities 
net cash provided by changes in working capital and other activities resulted primarily from a decrease in inventories and prepaid expenses  and from increases in accounts payable and accrued royalties  partly offset by increases in accounts receivable 
days sales outstanding were and for and  respectively 
inventory turns were and in and  respectively 
net cash of million used in investing activities resulted from capital expenditures  net of disposals 
capital expenditures in consisted primarily of additions to molds for new production molds  building improvements  machinery  and furniture and equipment related to computer hardware and software 
net cash of million used in financing activities consisted of the payment of dividends to stockholders and common stock repurchases  partially offset by the proceeds on issuance of common stock under our stock option plans 
estimated uses of cash in include capital expenditures for building  machinery and molds  and equipment of approximately million 
we expect to fund expenditures for capital requirements as well as liquidity needs from a combination of available cash balances  internally generated funds  and financing arrangements 
we have an unsecured line of credit of million  which is subject to annual renewal at the option of the bank 
any amounts outstanding under the line are payable upon demand by the bank 
during and  we had no borrowings under the line of credit and as of december  there were no balances outstanding 
we believe we will be able to renew our line of credit under similar terms 
contractual obligations the following table provides a summary of our principal contractual obligations at december  payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years minimum royalty payments purchase obligations employee agreement dividends a cash dividend of per share and per share of common stock was paid in june of and  respectively 
we currently expect sufficient cash flow in to continue our current dividend policy 
special purpose entities during the years ended december  and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance  variable interest or special purpose entities  which would have the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
ii 
table of contents inflation and changing prices inflation has not had a material effect on our operating results during recent periods 
recent accounting pronouncements in  the emerging issues task force eitf reached consensus on issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer 
the consensus in eitf no 
addresses the income statement classification of various types of sales incentives  including discounts  consumer coupons  rebates  and free products as well as slotting fees  cooperative advertising arrangements and buydowns 
the consensus requires these sales incentives be classified as a reduction of sales  versus a selling  general  and administrative expense 
we adopted the consensus in eitf issue no 
on january  eitf issue no 
was issued to codify and reconcile eitf nos 
  and which address the accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer 
with the adoption of this eitf in  sales incentives of approximately million  and million for years ended december   and respectively  were reclassified as a reduction to net sales and a corresponding reduction to selling  general  and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income 
the adoption of this consensus had no impact on operating income and net income 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
was effective for us as of january  sfas no 
supersedes apb opinion no 
 intangible assets  and requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives no longer be amortized  but reviewed for impairment at least annually 
intangible assets that are not deemed to have an indefinite life will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
the adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our consolidated statements of income  consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the statement retains the previously existing accounting requirements related to the recognition and measurement of the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used while expanding the measurement requirements of long lived assets to be disposed of by sale to include discontinued operations 
it also expands the previously existing reporting requirements for discontinued operations to include a component of an entity that either has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale 
we implemented sfas no 
on january  the adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in july  fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
the statement requires costs associated with exit or disposal activities to be recognized when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
the requirements of sfas no 
are effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after january  in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of sfas no 
 which provides optional transition guidance for those companies electing to voluntarily adopt the accounting provisions of sfas no 
in addition  the statement mandates certain new disclosures that are incremental to those required by sfas no 
we will continue to account for stock based compensation in accordance with apb no 
as such  we do not expect this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
we have adopted the disclosure only provisions of sfas no 
as of december  in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation for variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
which requires all variable interest entities vies to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary 
the primary beneficiary is the entity that holds the majority of the beneficial interest in the vie 
in addition  the interpretation expands the disclosure requirements for both variable interest entities that are consolidated as well as vies from which the entity is the holder of a significant amount of ii 
table of contents beneficial interests  but not the majority 
fin is effective for all new vies created or acquired after january  for vies created or acquired prior to february   the provisions of fin must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after june  we are evaluating the effect that the adoption of fin will have on our results of operations and financial condition 
however  as we are not involved in any special purpose entities  we do not anticipate that the effect of adopting this interpretation will be material to our consolidated statements of income  consolidated financial position or results of operations 
factors that may affect financial condition and future results the assumptions  risks and uncertainties included in this section are not exclusive 
other sections of this report may include additional factors  which could adversely impact our business and financial performance 
we operate in a very competitive environment 
new risk factors emerge from time to time and management cannot predict all such risk factors  nor can it assess the impact of all such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor or combination of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements 
see cautionary note regarding forward looking statements 
if we do not make timely introductions to the market of new and innovative products  we may not be able to maintain or improve our market share and keep pace with our competitors 
our growth depends in part upon our ability to create new and innovative products and to introduce new products to the market in a timely fashion 
we may not continue to generate new product ideas or successfully introduce such products to the market in a timely fashion 
additionally  our new products may not be well received by retailers or consumers 
our future growth also depends  in part  on the successful introduction of products that generate sufficient margins 
we may not be able to successfully develop and introduce such products 
in addition  we are under pressure to introduce new and innovative products more often and more quickly because the life cycle of many products has shortened over the last several years 
this is due partly to the ability of competitors to introduce similar products that compete directly with our successful new products 
as a result  the inability to introduce products in a timely fashion with sufficient margins could have a material adverse impact on our sales 
we depend on sales of products featuring licensed characters and if we lose all or a significant part of our third party licenses  our revenues may decrease 
we derive a significant portion of our revenues from sales of products featuring characters licensed from other parties  including winnie the pooh and mickey mouse and other related characters licensed from disney enterprises  inc  and sesame street characters licensed from sesame workshop  in the united states and in various foreign countries 
these licenses have fixed terms and limit the type of products that may be sold under the licenses 
one of our significant licensing agreements with disney enterprises  inc was renewed in and will expire at the end of  with an option to renew until the end of provided that certain conditions are met 
sales of products licensed under this license amounted to of our total net sales for the year ended december  while our management expects this licensing agreement to be renewed at the end of its term  non renewal of this major licensing agreement or renewal on terms not favorable to us could have a material adverse effect on our business 
if we do not enhance our brand recognition  our product sales may decrease 
a company s brand is very important to consumers of juvenile products 
some of our competitors have more recognizable brands than we do 
we intend to continue to enhance our brand recognition with consumers  but we may not be able to do so 
if we do not continue to enhance our brand recognition  our sales could be negatively impacted 
we must be able to identify and anticipate changing consumer preferences in order to keep consumers interested in our products 
the success of our business depends in part on continued consumer demand for our products and our ability to anticipate  gauge  and respond to changing consumer demands for juvenile products in a timely manner 
changes in consumer preferences  such as consumers abandoning traditional retailers  shopping on ii 
table of contents the internet  general economic decline  or less favorable demographic trends related to childbirth  among other factors  could have a material adverse effect on our sales and earnings 
we depend heavily on major customers  the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our three largest customers  wal mart  toys r us  and target  accounted for approximately  and of net sales in  respectively 
wal mart reduced its purchases from us from to a significant reduction of purchases by any one of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our sales 
additionally  our largest ten customers accounted for of our net sales in there could also be a negative effect on our business if any significant customer becomes insolvent or otherwise fails to pay its debts 
for example  in the write off of certain kmart receivables as a result of the kmart bankruptcy had a 
negative impact on our earnings per share 
conditions affecting the retail industry generally may affect our results of operations 
we could be materially adversely affected by conditions in the retail industry in general  including the continuing consolidation in the retail industry  the resulting decline in the number of retailers and other cyclical economic factors 
also  changes in the way retailers and mass merchandisers do business  such as the creation of competing private label brands by retailers  could result in a significant reduction of purchases of our products by those retailers  which would have a material adverse effect on our sales and earnings 
we are exposed to economic  political  and other risks through our worldwide operations 
we are subject to the economic and political risks inherent in international operations and their impact on the united states economy in general  including the risks associated with ongoing uncertainties and political and economic instability in many countries around the world  including the war in iraq  as well as the economic disruption from acts of terrorism  particularly in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of september  and the response to them by the united states and its allies 
these risks include air transportation disruptions  expropriation  currency controls and changes in currency exchange rates  tax and tariff rates  freight rates and social and political unrest 
the market for juvenile products is intensely competitive and our competitors may be stronger than we are 
we compete with many other companies  both domestic and foreign  some of which have diversified product lines  well known brands and financial  distribution  and marketing resources that are substantially greater than ours 
other major factors that affect competition in the markets in which we compete include prices for products and placement of product with major retailers 
also  a major technological breakthrough or marketing success by a competitor could adversely affect our competitive position 
in addition  in countries where the juvenile products market is mature  particularly in the united states  sales growth partly depends on our ability to increase our market share at the expense of our competitors 
we may not be able to continue to compete effectively in the juvenile products market 
we do not own or operate our own manufacturing facilities and any significant problems that we experience with independent manufacturers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we depend upon independent manufacturers to produce high quality products for us in a timely manner 
we also rely upon the availability of sufficient production capacity at our existing manufacturers or the ability to utilize alternative sources of supply 
timely product introductions are essential in the juvenile products industry because our orders are cancelable by customers and  in some cases  subject to monetary penalties imposed by customers  if agreed upon delivery dates are not met 
we may not be able to maintain sufficient inventory levels if our independent manufacturers fail to provide the required production capacity 
a failure by one or more of our significant manufacturers to meet established criteria for pricing  product quality or timeliness could also negatively impact our sales and profitability 
we have no long term manufacturing agreements with our suppliers and we compete with other juvenile product companies  including companies that are much larger than us  for access to production facilities 
in  our largest supplier  which is located in china  manufactured products that represented approximately of our sales 
the loss of or significant problems with this supplier could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
ii 
table of contents many of our products are manufactured in china and we may experience difficulty or increased expense in shipping these products back into the united states or europe 
a substantial portion of our products sold in was manufactured in asia 
foreign manufacturing is subject to a number of risks including transportation delays and interruptions  the imposition of tariffs  quotas  and other import or export controls  currency fluctuations  misappropriation of intellectual property  political and economic disruptions  and changes in governmental policies 
from time to time  the united states congress has attempted to impose additional restrictions on trade with china 
china gained permanent normal trade relations pntr status with the united states when it acceded to the world trade organization  effective january  the united states imposes the lowest applicable tariffs on exports from pntr countries to the united states 
in order to maintain its wto membership  china has agreed to several requirements  including the elimination of caps on foreign ownership of chinese companies  lowering tariffs and publicizing its laws 
no assurance can be given that china will meet these requirements and remain a member of the wto  or that its pntr trading status will be maintained 
if china s wto membership is withdrawn or if pntr status for goods produced in china were removed  there could be a substantial increase in tariffs imposed on goods of chinese origin entering the united states  including those manufactured by us  which could adversely impact our business 
the european community has enacted a quota and tariff system with respect to the importation into the ec of certain toy products originating in china 
although we continue to evaluate alternative sources of supply outside of china  we may not be able to develop alternative sources of supply in a timely and cost effective manner 
we may have difficulty obtaining sufficient amounts of a particular product or disposing of excess inventory if we miscalculate the amount of a product that we will be able to sell 
many of our products have relatively long lead times for design and production of product or are manufactured by suppliers in foreign countries 
as a result  we must commit to production tooling and to production in advance of orders 
if we fail to accurately forecast consumer demand or if there are changes in consumer preferences or market demand after we have made such production commitments  we may encounter difficulty in filling customer orders or in liquidating excess inventory  may find that retailers are canceling orders or returning product  and may have to write off the cost of molds for certain unsuccessful products  all of which may have a material adverse effect on our sales  margins  profit  and brand image 
if the cost of the raw materials used in our products or the cost of transportation of those products increases  we may not be able to sustain our gross profits 
plastic  paperboard  other materials  and shipping and transportation costs for our products and packaging constitute significant costs to us 
the primary resource used in most manufacturing plastics is petroleum  and the cost and availability of plastic for use in our products varies with the price of petroleum 
the cost of transporting our products also varies with the cost of oil 
high transportation costs or the inability of our suppliers to acquire sufficient plastic  paperboard  and other materials at reasonable prices could adversely affect our ability to sustain our gross profit 
our international sales are significant to us  and international markets are subject to a number of risks 
our international sales in accounted for approximately of our total net sales 
in foreign markets  particularly the united kingdom  france  germany  and canada  we compete against long established companies with well known brand names 
in countries where the juvenile products markets are mature  our sales growth depends on our ability to increase our market share at the expense of well established local competitors 
international sales are also subject to economic downturns and fluctuations in the currencies of foreign countries  and resulting changes in the buying power of consumers in foreign markets  particularly in asia  and latin and south america 
although at times we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts in order to hedge our exposure to currency fluctuations  we may still encounter unfavorable exchange rates in our transactions with companies in foreign countries 
we may not be successful in expanding or sustaining our international sales operations 
ii 
table of contents our products for small children and babies are subject to stringent government regulations  which we must comply with or face recalls of our products or fines 
consumer products in general  and in particular products for babies and infants  are subject to regulation both domestically and internationally 
in addition  consumer activist groups put pressure on governments around the world to increase their regulations regarding the safety of the materials used to make products for babies and infants  such as certain kinds of plastic 
our products are subject to the provisions of the federal consumer safety act  the federal hazardous substances act  the federal flammable fabrics act  and the child safety protection act and the regulations promulgated thereunder 
these laws authorize the consumer product safety commission cpsc to protect the public from products that present a substantial risk of injury 
the cpsc can require the repurchase or recall by the manufacturer of articles that are found to be defective  and impose fines or penalties on the manufacturer  or recommend the recall of products containing chemicals or other materials deemed by the cpsc to be harmful to children and infants 
similar laws exist in some states and cities and in foreign countries where we market our products 
any recall of our products could have a material adverse effect on our earnings  depending on the particular product 
if our products for small children and infants are faulty  we may be subject to negative publicity and product liability claims that exceed our insurance coverage 
our juvenile products are developed for and used by small children and infants 
if our products have safety problems that we are not aware of or the cpsc recalls a product  we may experience negative publicity that could adversely impact our reputation and our sales 
additionally  we could be subject to product liability suits 
we carry product liability insurance in amounts which management deems adequate to cover risks associated with this use  however  existing or future insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all product liability risks 
our intellectual property is very important to us and we may face litigation based on challenges to our intellectual property 
we believe that our intellectual property has significant value 
to our knowledge  there are no pending material challenges to our intellectual property 
however  from time to time  we have been  and in the future may be  the subject of litigation challenging our ownership of certain intellectual property 
we may incur substantial costs in defending such legal actions 
because of the importance of our intellectual property  our business is subject to the risk of claims for intellectual property infringement 
if we do not retain our key personnel our ability to execute our business strategy will be limited 
our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and key management  and our ability to continue to attract  retain  and motivate qualified personnel 
competition for qualified personnel can be intense 
the loss of the services of key personnel or the inability to attract and retain additional qualified personnel could have an adverse effect on our operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks  which include changes in united states and international interest rates as well as changes in currency exchange rates as measured against the united states dollar and each other 
we attempt to reduce material risks by using foreign currency forward exchange contracts and managing our working capital to minimize currency and interest rate exposure 
foreign currency market risk our international operations are subject to certain opportunities and risks  including currency fluctuations 
our international sales in accounted for of total net sales 
the value of the united states dollar affects our financial results  and changes in exchange rates may affect our revenues  gross margins  operating expenses  and retained earnings as expressed in united states dollars 
at times  we use forward exchange contracts to hedge cash flows arising from sales denominated in foreign currencies to limit the impact of currency fluctuations 
principal currencies hedged include the euro  the british pound  and the ii 
table of contents canadian dollar 
we also attempt to minimize currency exposure risk through working capital management 
in and  the impact of foreign exchange gains or losses was not material 
we had no outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts as of december  and in january  certain member countries of the european union established irrevocable  fixed conversion rates between their currencies and the european union s common currency  the euro 
the introduction of the euro was phased in over a period ended january   when euro notes and coins came into circulation 
the replacement of legacy currencies with the euro did not have and is not expected to have a material impact on our operations or consolidated financial statements 
interest rate risks changes in interest rates affect interest income earned on our cash equivalents and short term investments  composed primarily of united states treasury obligations and short term money market instruments 
we do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposure to changes in interest rates in the united states or in international operations
