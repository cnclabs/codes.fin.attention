the words anticipates  believes  expects  intends or estimates and similar expressions identify forward looking statements 
prima does not undertake to update  revise or correct any of the forward looking information 
readers are cautioned that such forward looking statements should be read in connection with prima s disclosures under the heading cautionary statement for the purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of the following discussion is intended to assist in understanding our financial position and results of operations for the three year period ended december  the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto should be referred to in conjunction with this discussion 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion of financial condition and results of operation are based upon the information reported in our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
we base our decisions on historical experience and various other sources that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from the estimates we calculated due to changing business conditions or unexpected circumstances 
policies we believe are critical to understanding our business operations and results of operations are detailed below 
for additional information on our significant accounting policies you should see notes to consolidated financial statements  particularly notes and  in our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we engage in the exploration  development  acquisition and production of natural gas and crude oil 
our revenue recognition policy is significant because our revenue is a key component of our results of operations and our forward looking statements contained in liquidity and capital resources 
we derive our revenue primarily from the sale of produced natural gas and crude oil 
revenue is recorded in the month our production is delivered to the purchaser  but payment is generally received between and days after the date of production 
at the end of each period we make estimates of the amount of production delivered to the purchaser and the price we received 
we use our knowledge of our properties  their historical performance  nymex and local spot market prices and other factors as the basis for these estimates 
variances between our estimates and the actual amounts received  which have historically been minimal  are recorded in the month such estimates are revised or when payment is received 
fair value of derivative instruments beginning in  the estimated fair values of our derivative instruments are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet 
generally  our derivative instruments are entered into to mitigate risks related to the prices we will receive for our future natural gas and oil production 
although our derivatives are reported on the balance sheet at fair value  to the extent that instruments qualify for hedge accounting treatment  changes in fair value are not included in our consolidated results of operations 
instead  they are recorded net of taxes directly to stockholders equity until the hedged oil or natural gas quantities are produced  at which time any gain or loss realized is recognized as an adjustment to revenues 
to the extent changes in the fair values of derivatives relate to instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment  such changes are recorded in income in the period they occur 
in determining the amounts to be recorded  we are required to estimate the fair values of derivatives 
our estimates are based upon various factors that include contract volumes and prices  contract settlement dates  quoted closing prices on the nymex or over the counter and  where applicable  volatility and the time value of options 
the calculation of the fair value of collars and floors may require the use of the black scholes option pricing model  although market quotations will be used to establish fair value when available 
for fixed price contracts  the futures prices estimated as of the valuation date are 
table of contents compared to the prices fixed by the derivatives agreements  and the resulting estimated future cash inflows or outflows over the lives of the hedges are discounted to calculate the fair value of the derivative contracts 
these pricing and discounting variables are sensitive to market volatility as well as changes in future price expectations  regional price differences and interest rates 
we periodically validate our valuations using independent third party quotations 
reserve estimates the estimates of our oil and gas reserves are  by necessity  projections based on geologic and engineering data  and there are uncertainties inherent in the interpretation of such data as well as the projection of future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that are difficult to measure 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
estimates of economically recoverable gas and oil reserves and future net cash flows necessarily depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions  such as expected future production rates  oil and gas prices  operating costs  severance taxes and development costs  all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results 
future development costs projected for proved undeveloped locations may ultimately increase to an extent that these reserves might not be economically recoverable 
for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of oil and gas attributable to any particular group of properties  classifications of such reserves based on risk of recovery  and estimates of the future net cash flows expected there from may vary substantially due to new data or changed assumptions 
any significant variance in the assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of the reserves  which could affect the carrying value of prima s oil and gas properties and or the rate of depletion of the oil and gas properties 
actual production  revenues and expenditures with respect prima s reserves will likely vary from estimates  and such variances may be material 
full cost method we use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas activities 
under this method  all costs incurred in the acquisition  development and exploration of oil and gas properties are capitalized into cost centers that are established on a country by country basis we have a single cost center for the united states 
such amounts include the costs of drilling and equipping productive wells  dry hole costs  lease acquisition costs and delay rentals 
capitalized costs also include salaries  employee benefits  costs of consulting services and other expenses that are directly related to acquisition  development and exploration activities 
costs associated with production and general corporate activities are expensed in the period incurred 
depletion the capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties  plus estimated future development and abandonment costs related to our proved reserves  are amortized on a unit of production method based on our estimate of total proved reserves 
the quantities of estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of amortization  and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense 
generally  if estimated reserve volumes increase or decrease  then the amortization rate per unit of production will change inversely 
however  when estimated future costs change  the amortization rate moves in the same direction 
the per unit rate is not affected by production volumes 
full cost ceiling limitation under the full cost method  we are subject to quarterly calculations of a limitation  or ceiling  on the amount that can be capitalized on our balance sheet for oil and gas properties 
if the net capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties exceed the cost center ceiling  we are subject to a ceiling test writedown to the extent of such excess 
a ceiling test writedown is a non cash charge to earnings 
if required  it would reduce earnings and impact stockholders equity in the period of occurrence and result in lower amortization expense in future periods 
the discounted present value of our proved reserves is a major component of the ceiling calculation and requires subjective judgments 
given the volatility of oil and gas prices  it is likely that our estimate of discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves will change in the future 
if oil and gas prices decline  even if only for a short period of time  or if we have downward revisions to our estimated proved reserves  it is possible that writedowns of our oil and gas properties could occur 
while the quantities of proved reserves require substantial judgment  the associated prices of oil and gas reserves that are included in the discounted present value of the reserves do not require judgment 
the future net revenues associated with our estimated proved reserves are not based on our assessment of future prices 
the ceiling calculation dictates that prices and costs in effect as of the last day of the quarter are assumed to remain constant in the 
table of contents future 
however  we may not be subject to a writedown if prices increase shortly after the end of a quarter in which a writedown might otherwise be required 
unevaluated costs unevaluated costs are excluded from our amortization base until we have evaluated the properties associated with these costs 
the costs associated with unevaluated leasehold acreage and wells that have not yet been determined to be productive or non productive are not initially included in our amortization base 
leasehold and associated costs are either transferred to our amortization base with the costs of drilling related wells or are assessed quarterly for possible impairment or reduction in value 
leasehold costs are transferred to our amortization base if estimated fair value is below cost 
the decision to withhold costs from amortization and the timing of transferring such costs into the amortization base involves a significant amount of management judgment and may be subject to changes over time based on several factors  including our drilling plans  availability of capital  project economics and results of drilling on adjacent acreage 
other property and equipment oilfield service equipment and other property and equipment are carried at cost 
renewals and betterments are capitalized  while repairs and maintenance are expensed 
capitalized costs are depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
the carrying value of property and equipment is reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
assets are determined to be impaired if a forecast of undiscounted estimated future net operating cash flows directly related to the asset  including disposal value if any  is less than the carrying amount of the asset 
if any asset is determined to be impaired  the loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
an estimate of fair value is based on the best information available  including prices for similar assets 
changes in such estimates could result in a reduction in the carrying value of our property and equipment 
income taxes we provide for deferred income taxes on the difference between the tax basis of an asset or liability and its carrying amount in our financial statements 
this difference will result in taxable income or deductions in future years when the reported amount of the asset or liability is recovered or settled  respectively 
our federal and state income tax returns are generally not filed before the consolidated financial statements are prepared 
we  therefore  estimate the tax basis of our assets and liabilities at the end of each period as well as the effects of tax rate changes  tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards 
any differences between estimates we initially used and subsequently determined to be appropriate are recorded in the period in which our estimate is revised 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity have been internal generation of cash flow from operations  proceeds from occasional asset sales  and existing net working capital 
additional potential sources of capital include borrowings and issuances of common stock or other securities 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled  in the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  our net working capital increased from  at the end of to  on december  our cash equivalents and short term investments also increased in  from  at the beginning of the year to  at the end of  and prima was free of long term debt at both dates 
we also had no capital lease agreements or guarantees 
our operating lease agreements are disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
prima s revenues and cash flows are substantially derived from oil and gas sales  which are dependent on oil and gas sales prices and production volumes 
oil and gas sales prices have been volatile and our average price realizations in were lower  on an mcfe basis  than in combined with an decline in net production volumes  these lower prices led to a decline in prima s oil and gas sales revenue from to  including hedging effects  from  to  the decline in our oil and gas sales revenue was the primary factor accounting for lower cash flow in prima s future revenues will continue to be significantly affected by volatility in oil and gas 
table of contents prices 
as further discussed below  oil and gas prices to date in and as reflected in futures markets for the balance of the year  are higher than in  and we are projecting an increase in prima s net production volumes 
as such  oil and gas sales  and cash provided by operating activities  are expected to increase in the current year 
we realized  of proceeds from the sale of oil and gas properties in approximately  of this amount was realized through the sale on march  of the stones throw cbm project in the northern powder river basin  associated gathering system facilities and approximately  net undeveloped acres in the stones throw area 
the stones throw property accounted for approximately of our total estimated proved oil and gas reserves and of the related estimated present value of future net cash flows before income taxes  as of the end of the stones throw wells accounted for approximately of our oil and gas production and of our sales revenue before hedging effects in the first two months of we invested  in additions to oil and gas properties during  compared to  in and  in during   was expended for oil and gas property development   for exploratory activities   for acquisitions of unproved oil and gas properties  and  for purchases of proved properties 
other uses of funds in included  for other fixed assets  predominantly oilfield service equipment and facilities  and  for treasury stock repurchases net of proceeds from stock option exercises 
excluding acquisitions  we plan to make capital investments in aggregating between million and million 
our initial projected allocation for such investments is approximately as follows for exploitation of cbm properties in the powder river basin  for development of properties in the denver basin  for higher risk exploration activities  and for other operations  including oilfield service companies 
the planned cbm activities include drilling a total of to gross wells in our porcupine tuit  kingsbury  wild turkey  and cedar draw project areas 
activities planned at porcupine tuit will be primarily for drilling proved undeveloped locations near other wells that have been producing gas at favorable rates from relatively shallow  but thick wyodak coals for several months 
drilling at the other three projects will be targeting non proved reserves in deeper coals that have not yet been extensively developed in the area 
we anticipate that these deeper coals will need to be de watered for a longer period of time  perhaps a year or more  before significant gas production rates could be established 
as a result  these activities may not generate additions to our production or proved reserves in the current year 
if our expectations are realized  however  operations on these properties will result in significant increases in both production and proved reserves in future periods 
we intend to review our capital budget on an ongoing basis and may adjust it based on drilling results  changes in oil and gas prices  identification of new opportunities  or other factors 
in addition  although not budgeted  we continue to seek acquisitions that we believe will enhance our existing businesses 
an acquisition could be consummated using our existing working capital  bank borrowings  and or through issuance of debt or equity securities 
in january  prima s board of directors approved a repurchase program of up to of our common stock then outstanding  or approximately  shares 
as of december   approximately  shares remained subject to repurchase under this authorization 
we expect to fund our oil and gas property exploration  development  and exploitation operations  ordinary equipment additions for our service companies  and any repurchases of common stock with cash provided by operating activities 
working capital on hand at the beginning of the year may also be utilized 
our expectations as to cash provided by operating activities are predicated on projections of oil and gas production volumes  and oil and gas prices  among other factors 
without any contribution from new exploration or acquisitions  we are projecting that our current year oil and gas production will approximate  mcfe to  mcfe  representing year over year growth of to 
the initial wells that were hooked up at prima s porcupine tuit project area during the second half of have performed well  and this cbm project is the principal source of the expected year over year production growth 
gross production at porcupine tuit has ramped up to approximately  mcf per day at the end of february  and we expect gross production to increase to approximately  mcf per day at some point during the second quarter of the 
table of contents year  when the third party contracted to gather our gas in this area is planning to install additional compression 
we have been delayed in obtaining permits to access certain drilling locations within our porcupine tuit project area  due to regulatory review and a third party s appeal of the forest service s decision in favor of approving our requested permits 
we anticipate a favorable resolution of this appeal and are currently planning to drill approximately wells beginning in the third quarter of however  this scheduled drilling is dependent upon receiving permit approvals from both the forest service and the bureau of land management  and further delays could be encountered 
if such delays occur  our estimates of production could be unfavorably impacted 
prima plans to hook up four wells drilled at porcupine tuit in that are currently shut in later in the year 
if drilling permits are secured for new drilling  hook up of these four wells and new wells drilled in will be coordinated to maximize efficiencies 
our net working and revenue interests in the existing and planned wells at porcupine tuit average approximately and  respectively 
natural gas is currently expected to account for more than of prima s total oil and gas production in gas prices have strengthened during the past several months  in response to a number of factors  including among others cold weather during the winter of that has reduced storage inventories  declining north american natural gas production  and a modest response to date in drilling activity levels in response to higher prices 
as of march   average prices for the nymex gas contracts that have expired january through march plus the average of the quoted prices for the remainder of nymex gas contracts combine to average per mmbtu of natural gas 
these compare to the average closing prices for nymex gas contracts during of per mmbtu of natural gas 
our realized gas prices are generally lower than nymex  due primarily to location and transportation costs  as discussed below  but these nymex comparisons are a reflection of recent price movements in gas markets 
there is no assurance  however  that prices reflected in futures markets will actually be realized  except to the extent that fixed price contracts are entered into 
as of the close of business on march   we had forward sold  mmbtu of natural gas per month for the months of may through october  at an average nymex price of per mmbtu 
these contracts do not qualify as effective hedges because we have not locked in the basis differential between the nymex contract henry hub delivery point and a rocky mountain delivery point near our wells 
for the period covered by these nymex contracts  this basis differential was quoted at approximately per mmbtu discount for the colorado interstate gas cig index  as of march  an additional  mmbtu of natural gas have been forward sold for april  at an average cig price of per mmbtu  which represents an effective hedge 
with respect to crude oil  as of march  we had entered into forward sale nymex contracts covering  barrels per month for the contract months of july through december  at an average price of per barrel 
combined  these positions total approximately  mcfe of volumes  representing less than of prima s expected oil and gas production during the last nine months of results of operations as noted  our primary source of revenues is the sale of oil and natural gas production 
because of significant fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices and variances in production volumes  our operating results for any period are not necessarily indicative of future operating results 
oil and gas prices have historically been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile 
prices are affected by  among other things  market supply and demand factors  market uncertainty  and actions of the united states and foreign governments and international cartels 
these factors are beyond our control 
our revenues  cash flows  earnings and operations are adversely affected when oil and gas prices decline 
natural gas has typically represented approximately of our total oil and gas production mix 
gas prices declined significantly after reaching record high levels early in  until early when prices again approached record levels 
these price movements have significantly impacted our operating results  as more fully described below 
we cannot accurately predict future oil and natural gas prices  but historically oil and gas supply and demand have responded to changes in price levels to correct from short lived extreme levels of high or low prices 

table of contents in addition to factors affecting global or national markets for oil and natural gas  our business is subject to regional influences on natural gas markets 
gas production in the rocky mountain area  where prima s producing properties are located  generally exceeds regional consumption needs and the surplus is transported via pipelines to other markets 
rocky mountain gas has typically sold for a lower price than gas produced in the gulf coast region or in areas closer to major consumption markets that rely on gas delivered from outside the region 
the size of the discount has varied widely based on seasonal factors  structural factors  and other supply and demand influences 
from through  cig gas prices have averaged approximately per mmbtu less than the average for gas at henry hub  but the amount of this discount has ranged on an annual basis between and  and monthly variances in index prices have ranged between an premium january and a discount october 
basis differentials widened considerably beginning in may  resulting in depressed regional prices for rocky mountain gas in despite relatively strong gas prices in other areas of the country 
although rocky mountain gas prices improved during this past winter  basis differentials have remained wide  as prices in other regions have increased as much or more 
due in part to pipeline capacity expansion projects that will improve access to higher priced gas markets  commodity futures markets as of march  reflected expectations of moderately improving basis differentials  to per mmbtu from may through october  and per mmbtu for the winter of the largest of these planned expansions  and the one scheduled to come on line soonest  is the kern river pipeline  which is expected to commence operations in may with an additional  mcf per day of capacity that will move gas from southwest wyoming to nevada and california markets 
future basis differentials  which we expect to have an important impact on our operating results  may vary substantially from the current indications on futures markets due to a number of factors  including but not limited to  the timing  size and location of pipeline expansions and the timing  size and location of changes in regional gas deliverability

this total included hedging losses of  which were reflected in our oil and gas sales  plus  of separately reported losses on derivative instruments that did not qualify for hedge accounting 
derivative instruments that did not qualify for hedge accounting were principally nymex gas swaps for which we did not elect to enter into corresponding swaps for rocky mountain basis differentials 
the  of recorded losses on non qualifying derivatives consisted of  of net amounts received by us on settlements of positions closed in  offset by  of net unrealized losses that primarily represented reversals of unrealized mark to market gains recognized in the prior year 
these reversals occurred because mark to market gains on natural gas futures positions held at december  were reduced as gas prices escalated in before the contracts were settled

prima s stones throw cbm property  which was sold in march  contributed  net mcf during the two months the property was owned in  compared to  mcf in  largely accounting for the declines in gas volumes and net equivalent units 
gas production from the porcupine tuit cbm property  which was initiated at the end of july  roughly offset oil and gas production declines on other properties 
such declines were attributable to a high level of drilling and well recompletion activity in the first half of  in response to a strong commodity price environment  followed by reduced activity levels in the second half of and in in response to a significant decline in rocky mountain gas prices

our provision for income taxes was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or 
our effective tax rate decreased to in from in the effective tax rates in both years were less than statutory rates due to permanent differences in book and tax basis income  consisting primarily of statutory depletion deductions and section tax credits 
the lower effective tax rate in was primarily attributable to a  or  decrease in pre tax income without a proportionate change in permanent differences 
permanent differences will be smaller in future years  in the absence of new legislation  as a result of the expiration of section tax credits at the end of proved oil and gas reserves from the end of to the end of  our proved oil and gas reserves declined by  mmcfe  from  mmcfe to  mmcfe 
the year over year decline primarily reflected  mmcfe of property sales and exchanges  most of which is accounted for by the stones throw property disposition  and net revisions aggregating approximately  mmcfe 
estimated additions to proved reserves from extensions  discoveries and acquisitions in totaled approximately  mmcfe  slightly greater than total production during the year of approximately  mmcfe 
most of prima s investments in were directed toward activities that did not add  nor were expected to add  incremental proved reserves during the year  including development of previously established proved reserves in the denver basin and at the porcupine tuit cbm property  pilot projects in the powder river basin designed to evaluate and develop deeper coal seams  which will generate proved reserves additions in future periods if our expectations are met  exploration on the coyote flats prospect in utah  where the initial test well has not yet been completed and determination of commerciality is still pending  and exploratory acreage acquisitions 
net revisions to proved reserves during the year were primarily attributable to prima s powder river basin cbm properties  and reflected more conservative estimation methodology and incorporation of additional data related to non producing properties with thinner  shallower coals 
in addition to incorporating stricter criteria employed by prima s independent engineers for determining which undrilled cbm locations qualified as having proved reserves  prima elected 
table of contents to prepare estimates of cbm reserves at the end of utilizing more conservative assumptions than previously used 
among the changes were the following we increased estimated future development and operating costs  to reflect rising costs for certain services and arrangements with surface owners  we increased projected costs for water disposal due to anticipated regulatory actions  we incorporated expectations of longer lead times for property development  due primarily to anticipated regulatory constraints  we modified the projected production profile  to reflect an assumption of longer de watering times  and  we excluded all undrilled locations for which economic runs indicated expected returns above  but less than  to more closely approximate our internal hurdle rate 
as a result  our estimated reserves at the end of excluded properties with thinner  shallower coals that we do not currently anticipate developing  as we concentrate on higher potential reserve targets 
at december   these higher potential reserve targets were not proved 
generally  these targets are deeper and thicker coals than the wyodak coals that were extensively developed in the initial phases of the industry s exploitation of cbm potential in the powder river basin 
these deeper coals are in the early stages of evaluation and development by prima and other operators in the area

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risks relate to changes in prices received on sales of natural gas and oil production 
we periodically enter into derivative contracts to mitigate a portion of this commodity price risk  or in an effort to enhance profitability 
such derivatives consist of commodity futures or price swaps agreements with counterparties to exchange floating prices for fixed prices  and options on such futures or price swaps 
generally  these instruments reduce our exposure to decreases in gas and oil prices  or increases in differentials between nymex and rocky mountain gas prices  but they also typically limit the benefits we realize from increases in prices or narrowing of basis differentials 
when hedging only a portion of our exposure to changes in prices  we are able to benefit from increases in gas and oil prices or improvements in basis differentials  but we remain exposed to market risk on the portion of our production not covered by such derivatives 
we also retain risks related to the ineffective portion of such derivatives instruments  when applicable 

table of contents we may enter into derivatives positions intended to offset risks associated with downward price movements in benchmark nymex oil and gas prices  as well as basis swaps to protect us from increases in the differential between nymex and rocky mountain gas prices 
our derivatives contracts generally represent cash flow hedges that are determined to be qualifying or non qualifying for hedge accounting treatment in accordance with the provisions of sfas at times  however  we may consider establishing derivative positions that do not represent cash flow hedges 
see note and note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information with respect to derivatives and related accounting policies 
personnel who we believe have appropriate skills and experience execute all derivatives transactions 
the personnel involved in these activities must follow prescribed trading limits and parameters that are regularly reviewed by our chief executive officer 
our chief executive officer approves all derivatives transactions before being entered into and our board of directors regularly reviews outstanding positions and hedging strategy 
we use only conventional derivatives instruments and attempt to manage our credit risk by entering into derivatives contracts only with financial institutions that we believe to be reputable and which carry an investment grade rating 
following are disclosures regarding our market risk instruments 
investors and other users are cautioned to avoid simplistic use of these disclosures 
users should realize that the actual impact of future commodity price movements will likely differ from the amounts disclosed below due to ongoing changes in risk exposure levels and concurrent adjustments to positions 
it is not possible to accurately predict future movements in natural gas and oil prices 
during  we sold  barrels of produced oil 
a hypothetical decrease of per barrel of average prices for the period exclusive of hedging transactions would have decreased our revenues by  for the period 
we sold  mcf of produced natural gas during the same period 
a hypothetical decrease of per mcf of average prices for the period exclusive of hedging transactions would have decreased our revenues by  for the period 
we closed on certain derivatives positions between the end of and march   for net realized losses totaling  as of the close of business on march   our open oil and gas derivatives instruments reflected net unrealized mark to market gains of  as follows average market total volumes contract unrealized time period index mmbtu or bbls price gains natural gas futures april cig   may october nymex   oil futures july december nymex   total unrealized gains the cig natural gas contracts  but not the nymex natural gas contracts  are considered to be effective hedges  since prima s current production is all located in the rocky mountain region 
for the period covered by these nymex contracts  a recent quote to lock in the basis differential  which would convert the nymex natural gas contracts to effective hedges  was approximately a per mmbtu discount for rocky mountain natural gas 
the oil contracts also represent effective hedges 
combined  these positions total approximately  mcfe of volumes  representing less than of prima s expected oil and gas production during the last nine months of
