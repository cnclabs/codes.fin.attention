overview verisity s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon verisity s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
we provide software products that automate the process of detecting flaws in the designs of electronic systems and ics and enable our customers to deliver higher quality electronic products  accelerate time to market and reduce overall product development costs 
we were founded in september and commenced operations in january in november  we acquired surefire verification  inc by merging it into our wholly owned subsidiary  verisity design  inc  a california corporation 
the surefire acquisition was accounted for under the pooling of interests method  and the operations of surefire are therefore included in our results of operations for all periods presented and the discussions thereof 
in  we released our original specman functional verification software product 
in the second quarter of  surefire released our surecov software product 
in the fourth quarter of  we released specman elite  an enhanced version of our original specman product 
in the fourth quarter of  we released our surelint software product 
in the second quarter of we introduced a major upgrade to our specman elite product 
we have also introduced several other products and support programs  which enhance the use of our products in the functional verification process 
our sales are generally denominated in united states dollars  however  a portion of our operating expenses in international locations is denominated in local currencies 
historically  our exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations has been minimal 
however  as our international sales and operations expand  we anticipate that our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations will increase 
our total revenue  which consists of license revenue  maintenance revenue and other services revenue  was million in  million in and million in license revenue consists of fees paid by our customers to license our software products 
maintenance revenue consists of fees for support and product updates  typically for a one year period 
other services revenue consists of training and consulting fees 
historically  we have generated the majority of our total revenue from license fees 
however  as a result of our growing customer base  maintenance revenue has increased as a percent of total revenue 
we currently derive 
table of contents substantially all of our total revenue from the sale of licenses for a small number of software products and related maintenance and other services 
sales of our specman elite and other functional verification class of products accounted for of our license revenue in  and we expect that substantially all of our revenue in will continue to be generated from sales of licenses of our functional verification products and related maintenance and other services 
throughout our customers faced a difficult and unpredictable economic environment with respect to the end markets for their products and their overall financial health 
the year marked the third consecutive year of such a protracted downturn in the economic environment for the electronics industry in which our customers compete 
this uncertainty continued throughout without perceptible relief 
the result of this prolonged uncertainty caused most customers  particularly the financially weakest  to scrutinize more heavily their r d investments with spending decisions being delayed as long as possible and  in some cases  additional development programs being further rationalized or discontinued and many smaller companies going out of business 
while new orders for our functional verification products  maintenance and other services increased in over order levels recorded in and  the rate at which new orders were received slowed in the latter half of the year and did not keep pace with the growth in reported revenue  due primarily to the economic environment 
as a result  we expect future near term revenue to decline sequentially and we cannot predict with any certainty if and when forward looking revenue may increase 
please see the risk factor for the effect on our revenue if our products are not adopted 
we sell our products and related maintenance and other services directly through our sales force and through indirect channels that include international distributors and sales representatives 
direct sales account for substantially all of our sales in north america 
revenue from sales outside north america accounted for of our total revenue in  of our total revenue in and of our total revenue in we believe that international markets represent a significant growth opportunity for our business and we anticipate that international revenue will increase as a percent of total revenue in the future 
in order to increase market share in international locations and better serve our global customers  we plan to further expand our international operations 
we expect that this expansion will require a substantial investment in personnel  facilities and operations  which tend to be more costly than similar investments in domestic operations 
as a result of these investments in our international operations  we may experience an increase in cost of sales and other operating expenses disproportionate to revenue from those operations 
our indirect sales channels include independent sales representatives and distributors 
although we enter into general sales contracts with our distributors and sales representatives  generally they are not obligated to purchase any of our products 
we rely on our indirect sales channels to submit purchase orders for specific quantities of our products 
we license our software products to customers under either perpetual or time based licenses 
the term for our time based licenses is typically one year 
our software products do not require customization or modification for our customers to install and use them 
customers purchasing maintenance receive internet based technical support  telephone support and unspecified product updates when we choose to make updates available 
we believe these product updates  which our customers have the right to use for the remaining term of their license  are the primary reason that a majority of our customers renew maintenance every year 
our services include training in the use of our products and consulting services 
our products are generally priced based on a perpetual or an annual time based fee per license 
our list prices generally range from  to  per license  depending on the product and the license term 
we generally price one year of maintenance at of the list price of a perpetual license 
our perpetual and time based licenses are always sold with maintenance 
maintenance for perpetual licenses may then be separately renewed 

table of contents since we commenced operations in  we have incurred substantial costs to develop our technology and products  to recruit and train personnel for our research and development  sales and marketing and technical customer support departments and to establish an administrative organization 
as a result  we had an accumulated deficit of million as of december  we anticipate that our operating expenses will increase substantially in the future as we fund additional research and development projects  increase our sales and marketing operations both domestically and internationally  develop new sales channels  increase our technical services capabilities and improve our operational and financial systems 
accordingly  we will need to generate higher revenue in the future to sustain our profitability 
please also refer to the risk factors 
we had employees as of december   an increase from employees as of december  critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to collection of accounts receivable  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition  accounting for research and development costs  accounting for doubtful accounts  accounting for share based compensation  accounting for income taxes 
revenue recognition 
for each sales arrangement  we defer the recognition of revenue until we have persuasive evidence of an arrangement  we deliver the product and the related license key or we perform the services  with no remaining obligations  the fee is fixed or determinable  and we determine that collection of the fee is probable 
for perpetual licenses  once all of these conditions have been satisfied  we recognize license revenue based upon the residual method after all elements which do not have vendor specific objective evidence of fair value have been delivered as prescribed by statement of position  modification of sop no 
 software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  as vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for the delivered elements does not exist 
we recognize revenues from product sales through our international distributors when the distributor sells a product license to an end user 
in accordance with sop no 
 vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of fair value of maintenance can be determined by reference to the price the customer is charged when maintenance is sold separately  which is based on the price we established and have received from our customers for separate maintenance renewals 
because almost every purchaser of perpetual software licenses subsequently purchases separate annual maintenance renewals  we believe we have vsoe of fair value for these maintenance arrangements 
however  with respect to our time based licenses with terms of less than months  we have concluded that we do not have vsoe of fair value for maintenance 
as a result  we recognize the revenue for these time based licenses ratably over the period of the arrangement 

table of contents further  with respect to these time based license arrangements  we allocate the revenue based on our standard price list  which has resulted in approximately being allocated to license revenue and being allocated to maintenance revenue 
our revenue recognition policy is significant because our revenue is a key component of our results of operations 
in addition  our revenue recognition determines the timing of recognizing certain expenses  such as commissions that we match with the corresponding revenue 
we follow very specific and detailed guidelines in measuring revenue 
any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and could result in future operating losses 
accounting for research and development costs 
we apply statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed to software technologies we develop internally 
we include internal development costs in research and development  and we expense those costs as they are incurred 
sfas requires the capitalization of certain internal development costs once technological feasibility is established  which  based upon our development process  generally occurs upon the completion of a working model 
to date  the costs incurred between the completion of a working model and the general availability of our products have not been significant 
accordingly  we have not capitalized any software development costs to date 
accounting for doubtful accounts 
our accounts receivable are mainly derived from sales to customers located primarily in north america  europe  israel and the far east 
we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and generally do not require them to pledge collateral or grant us a security interest in their assets to secure their payment obligation to us 
as of december   and  the allowances for doubtful accounts were nil and  respectively 
accounting for share based compensation 
we recorded deferred share compensation on our balance sheet of million in connection with the share options that were granted to our employees from july  to december  this deferred share compensation is amortized over the vesting period of the related options  which is generally four years  using the graded method 
during   and  we amortized   and  of deferred share compensation  respectively 
we expect the remaining deferred share compensation at december  at the amount of  will be amortized as follows  for the year ending december  and the balance thereafter 
accounting for income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes 
this statement prescribes the use of the liability method whereby deferred taxes assets and liability account balances are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
we provide a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to their estimated realizable value 
we have not recognized any benefit from the future use of loss carryforwards for these periods or for any other period since inception because of uncertainty surrounding their realization 
the amount of net operating losses that we can utilize may be limited under tax regulations in some circumstances including acquisition activities 
under israeli tax law  israeli companies are generally subject to income tax at the corporate tax rate of 
however  income recognized by us from our investment programs that have been granted approved enterprise status is tax exempt or taxed at a lower rate for a specified period commencing on the date we exhaust any net operating loss carryforwards 
these tax benefits are not available to us with respect to income of our subsidiaries 
if these tax incentives are not renewed  if the tax rates applicable to us are rescinded or changed  or if tax authorities successfully challenge the manner in which profits are recognized among our subsidiaries or within 
table of contents specified tax jurisdictions  our worldwide effective tax rate could increase and our results of operations and cash flow could be materially harmed

cash provided by operating activities in was primarily attributable to net income  and increases in deferred revenues and other liabilities and accrued compensation  partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable 
deferred revenues result from the billing and collection of fees from our customers for the purchase of license agreements and maintenance services for which we have not yet recognized revenue 
we will recognize the respective revenue after meeting the terms and conditions detailed in our revenue recognition policy and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the long term portion of deferred revenues reflects revenues that will be recognized more than months in the future due to customers with license agreements or maintenance terms in excess of months 
in addition  certain of our software agreements 
table of contents require the staggered delivery of licenses over a period of time  some of which are in excess of months in the future 
primarily as a result of increasing orders of these types and timely collections of associated accounts receivable  we have experienced positive cash flow from operating activities for the years ended december   and net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  these investments were primarily for purchases of new computers  equipment and furniture as we expanded operations

as of december  and  we had no borrowings outstanding under this line of credit and had available borrowings under the line of approximately million 
in january we signed on a million line of credit with wells fargo bank secured by goods and equipment  working capital and intangible assets 
no amounts were outstanding under this line of credit as of the date of filing the annual report on form k 
our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the amount and timing of our revenue  the extent to which our existing and new products gain market acceptance  the extent to which customers continue to renew annual maintenance  the cost  timing and extent of our product development efforts  the cost  timing and extent of our sales  marketing and general administrative activities  and the available borrowings under line of credit arrangements 
we intend to continue to invest in the development of new products  enhancements to our existing products and expansion of our sales channels 
the factors described above will affect our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds 
we believe that cash flow from operations together with our current cash and investment balances and current credit facilities  will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for at least the next months  including increased operating expenses and purchases of property and equipment as described elsewhere in this form k 

table of contents although we currently have no plans  commitments or agreements with respect to any acquisitions or investments  it is possible that we may decide to undertake those activities during the next months to an extent that could require additional financial resources 
in that case  we may be required to raise additional financing through public or private financings  strategic relationships or other arrangements 
however  we cannot be certain that this funding  if needed  will be available on terms attractive to us  or at all 
furthermore  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to shareholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
our future minimum payments under noncancelable operating and capital lease agreements at december  were as follows in thousands leases year ending december included in the lease payments above are  under capital leases to be paid in and  to be paid in item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk we develop products primarily in israel  and also in north america  and sell those products primarily in north america  israel  europe and the eastern asia 
our sales outside north america were of our total revenue in and in as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
as substantially all of our sales are currently made in united states dollars  a strengthening of the united states dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
we incur expenses denominated in the local currencies in israel and europe 
as exchange rates vary  these expenses  when translated into united states dollars  may vary from expectations and adversely affect overall profitability 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash and cash equivalents 
we maintain a conservative investment policy  which intends to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
our cash and cash equivalents as of december   consists primarily of short term us government securities  demand deposits and money market funds held by institutions in the united states 
management s intent and current practice is to invest funds in excess of current operating requirements in obligations of the united states government and its agencies  investment grade state and local government obligations  securities of corporations in the united states rated a or p by standard poor s or moody s ratings  or money market funds  deposits or notes issued or guaranteed by commercial banks meeting certain credit rating and net worth requirements with maturities of less than two years 

table of contents these investments  included in our cash and cash equivalents  are exposed to short term fluctuations in interest rates 
should interest rates fall  our cash equivalents may produce less income than expected 
our long term liabilities  largely composed of deferred revenues  are not subject to interest rate risk 
given the liquid nature of our cash and cash equivalents and the non exposed nature of our long term liabilities  we have concluded that we do not have material market risk exposure due to changes in interest rates 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas  effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  under sfas  a liability for the cost associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized when the liability is incurred 
under prior guidance  a liability for such costs could be recognized at the date of commitment to an exit plan 
the effect of adoption of sfas is dependent on the company s related activities subsequent to the date of adoption 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
or fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin elaborates on the existing disclosure requirements for most guarantees  including residual value guarantees issued in conjunction with operating lease agreements 
it also clarifies that at the time a company issues a guarantee  the company must recognize an initial liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee and must disclose that information in its interim and annual financial statements 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions apply on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  our adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
in december  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
fas amends fas accounting for stock based compensation to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  fas amends the disclosure requirements of fas to require more prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the additional disclosure requirements of fas are effective for fiscal years ending after december  we have elected to continue to follow the intrinsic value method of accounting as prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
or apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  to account for employee stock options 
risk factors our quarterly operating results and ordinary share price may fluctuate  because we have a limited ability to accurately forecast our quarterly sales and our costs are relatively fixed in the short term 
we expect our quarterly operating results to fluctuate significantly due to a variety of factors  many of which are outside of our control 
our revenue is difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly from period to period 
because our expenses are largely independent of our revenue in any particular period  it is difficult to accurately forecast our operating results 
our operating expenses are based  in part  on anticipated future revenue and a high percentage of our expenses are relatively fixed in the short term 
as an example  our research and development and sales and marketing expenses together accounted for more than of our total operating expenses in  and as a result  if our revenue is below expectations in any quarter  the negative effect may be magnified by our inability to adjust our spending on these activities in a timely manner to offset the revenue shortfall 

table of contents as a result  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and  accordingly  that these comparisons should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
due to these and other factors  our operating results may be below market analysts expectations in some future quarters  which could cause the market price for our ordinary shares to decline 
we have a history of losses  have only been profitable for the past nine quarters and may not be able to sustain profitability  which may cause the market price of our ordinary shares to decline 
since we commenced operations in  we have incurred significant net operating losses and we have an accumulated deficit of million as of december  we have only been profitable since the fourth quarter of we expect to continue to incur additional operating expenses resulting primarily from research and development  sales and marketing  possible strategic acquisitions and general and administrative activities 
as a result  we will need to generate significant revenue to sustain profitability 
we may not be able to sustain profitability in the future 
we anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially in the next months as we continue to invest in research and development to enhance our existing products and technologies and to develop additional functional verification products  increase our sales and marketing activities  and implement additional internal systems  develop additional business infrastructure and hire additional management personnel to keep pace with our growth 
any failure to significantly increase our revenue as we implement our product and distribution strategies could also harm our ability to sustain profitability and could negatively impact the market price of our ordinary shares 
in addition  if we do not attain or sustain profitability in the future  we may be unable to continue our operations 
we compete in an emerging market with rapidly evolving technologies and product innovations  and our products are based on new technologies that may not be accepted by potential customers 
we compete in markets that are characterized by rapid technological changes  frequent new product introductions and innovations  uncertain product life cycles and changes in customer demands 
for example  in these markets a new functional verification technology may rapidly emerge and gain acceptance that does not rely on the use of software simulation of system  ic or ip core designs  which is the approach to functional verification supported by our current suite of products 
our future success will likely depend on our ability to respond to these factors  in part by financing and managing the significant research and development investment that is often required to develop new generations of our functional verification technologies and introduce these product innovations to the marketplace in a timely manner 
if our development efforts are not successful or are significantly delayed  our products may become obsolete and we may be unable to retain existing customers or attract or retain new ones 
even if we are successful in financing and managing a significant investment of our resources in product and technology innovations  such as our proprietary functional verification language called e  the industry may not accept or adopt them 
therefore  any enhancements or new generations of the technologies and products that we develop or acquire may not generate any revenue  or revenue in excess of the costs of development or acquisition 
we may not be able to effectively compete against  and may lose market share to  other vendors of functional verification products with greater resources and distribution channels  as well as engineering groups within potential customers that develop their own functional verification tools 
we may face competition from both existing vendors of functional verification tools and new ones that we anticipate will enter the market 
we also compete with the internal engineering groups of large systems and semiconductor companies 
in addition  we may face competition from companies developing functional 
table of contents verification products and methodologies based on new or emerging technologies 
even though some of these companies may not currently have substantial financial or marketing resources to promote their competing products  they could obtain those resources either by engaging in financing activities or by being acquired by larger companies with substantial financial or marketing resources and broader distribution channels  including larger companies that may already sell products to the design and functional verification engineering groups within our existing or potential customer base 
some of our existing competitors are larger companies that sell suites of tools applicable to nearly all stages in the design and functional verification of systems and ics 
these companies  including synopsys and cadence design systems  have better brand recognition  larger customer bases and greater financial and marketing resources than we do 
these strengths may allow them to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies or standards and changes in customer requirements 
these larger companies may also be able to compete more effectively than we can on the basis of price 
if these competitors elect to reduce the price of their competing products  we may be pressured to reduce the price of our products as well 
however  price based competition would reduce our gross profit and  if prolonged  would make it more difficult for us to attain or maintain profitability 
if we fail to compete effectively against these competitors  our market share and revenue could decline  perhaps significantly 
in addition  we face competition from verification engineering teams within both existing customers and potential customers that have developed and continue to use in house verification tools and methodologies 
one of our largest competitive challenges is to convince these engineering teams that our products and methodologies are superior to those that they have developed internally  considering the license fees and other costs of adopting our products and a resistance to learning our e verification language 
we face potential competitive risks from our decision to place our e verification language in the public domain 
we donated a portion of our e verification language to a public standards body 
once we donate the entire language to the public domain  our competitors may be more likely to write functional verification software that utilizes e  which may make their products more attractive to our customers 
to the extent that our customers are not forced to abandon their investment in learning e and writing verification environments using that language  our customers may move more easily to competitive products 
this in turn could cause our market share and license revenue to decline 
if companies that design and sell systems and ics do not adopt the use of our functional verification products  our revenue may not grow 
the adoption and continued use of our functional verification products by companies that design and sell systems and ics  known as systems and ic companies  is important to our continued success 
if the market for functional verification products fails to grow or grows more slowly than we currently anticipate  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed 
our ability to reach sustained revenue growth and sustain profitability in the future will likely depend on the continued development of this market and  to a large extent  on the continued growth in demand for communications and other electronic systems that incorporate complex systems and ics 
we believe that broad market acceptance of our functional verification products will depend on several factors  including the ability to significantly enhance the productivity of functional verification  ease of use  interoperability with third party vendors design automation and functional verification products  our customer s assessment of our financial resources and our technical  managerial  service and support expertise  price and our customers financial condition 

table of contents our revenue may decline substantially if our existing customers do not continue to purchase additional licenses or renew maintenance for our products 
we rely on the sale of additional licenses to  as well as the renewal of annual maintenance by  our existing customers 
additional revenue from our existing customers represented more than of our total revenue in even if we are successful in selling our products to new customers  if we fail to sell additional licenses for our products to our existing customers or if they fail to renew their annual maintenance agreements  we could experience a material decline in revenue 
none of our current customers is obligated to license new or future generations of our functional verification products 
general economic conditions and terrorist attacks may reduce our revenues and harm our business 
as our business has grown  we have become increasingly subject to the risks arising from adverse changes in domestic and global economic conditions 
because of the recent economic slowdown in the united states and in other parts of the world  many of the companies in the communications and other segments of the global electronics industry are delaying or reducing technology purchases and investments and similarly  our customers may delay payment for our products causing our accounts receivable to increase 
in addition  terrorist attacks could further contribute to the slowdown in the economies of north america  europe and asia 
the impact on us of this slowdown is difficult to predict  but if businesses or consumers defer or cancel purchases of electronic products  purchases by our customers who design  produce and market these products or components of these products could decline  causing our revenues to be adversely affected  which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and on our financial condition and our ability to sustain profitability 
our quarterly operating results and ordinary share price may fluctuate due to seasonal factors that affect the sale of our products 
we expect to experience fluctuations in the sale of licenses for our products due to seasonal factors 
we have experienced and anticipate we will continue to experience relatively lower sales in our first fiscal quarter due to patterns in the capital budgeting and purchasing cycles of our current and prospective customers and the economic incentives for our sales force 
we also expect that sales may decline during the summer months of our third quarter  particularly in the european markets 
it is difficult for us to evaluate the degree to which these capital budgeting and customer purchasing cycle variations and sales incentives may reduce our sales because our recent revenue growth may have largely overshadowed these factors in recent periods 
however  these factors may lead to fluctuations in our quarterly operating results in the future 
we have derived and will continue to derive a significant portion of our revenue from one class of product  and the failure of this class to satisfy market demand could have a disproportionate impact on our revenue and income 
specman elite and our other related functional verification products and related maintenance and other services have accounted for approximately of our revenue in each of the past seven fiscal years 
we expect that these products and related maintenance and other services will continue to account for substantially all of our revenue in the foreseeable future 
if this class of products fails to meet customer expectations so as to satisfy market demand  our business  financial condition and results of operations will suffer more than they would have if we offered a more diversified line of products 
our customer base is concentrated  and the loss of one or more of our customers could harm our financial condition  results of operation and business 
we derive a significant portion of our revenue from large orders placed by a relatively small number of customers 
for example  our three largest customers in  and  together accounted for  and of our total revenue  respectively 
during none of our customers accounted for or 
table of contents more of our total revenue 
in the year ended december   one customer  who contributed of total revenue  was the only customer to account for more than of total revenue 
the loss of one or more of these customers could significantly affect our revenue and cause our ordinary share price to decline 
we depend on our strategic marketing and sales relationships with influential semiconductor companies and independent ip core providers as well as with vendors of complementary products  and if these relationships suffer  we may have difficulty introducing and selling our products and our revenue would decline 
we believe that our success in proliferating our products within our target markets will depend in part on our ability to leverage the marketing and sales channels outside of our organization  through a variety of strategic programs and alliances that we have initiated 
we believe our relationships with influential semiconductor companies and independent ip core providers  as well as complementary product vendors  are important in order to validate our technology  facilitate broad market acceptance of our products and enhance our sales  marketing and distribution capabilities 
if we are unable to maintain and enhance these existing relationships and develop a similar relationship with other influential companies in our industry  we may have greater difficulty in selling our products or we may not be able to make our products interoperable with complementary design and functional verification products 
in some cases these complementary product vendors  such as cadence design systems and synopsys also offer functional verification software products that are competitive with our products 
because of this competition  they may elect to no longer work with us in our strategic programs or cooperate with our efforts to make our products interoperable with their products 
either of these developments could harm our business and financial prospects 
we depend on a limited number of key personnel  particularly our chief executive officer and our chief technology officer  who would be difficult to replace  and if we lose the services of these individuals or cannot hire additional qualified personnel  our business will likely be harmed 
our continued growth and success largely depend on the managerial and technical skills of key technical  sales and management personnel 
in particular  our business and operations are substantially dependent on the performance of moshe gavrielov  our chief executive officer  and yoav hollander  our chief technical officer 
if mr 
gavrielov or mr 
hollander were to leave or become unable to perform services for us  our business would likely be harmed 
our success also depends  to a substantial degree  upon our ability to attract  motivate and retain other highly qualified personnel 
since the technology associated with functional verification software is at a relatively early stage  there are a limited number of people who have adequate experience in our field 
consequently  we face considerable competition for the services of highly qualified software engineers  functional verification engineers and other research and development employees  as well as for qualified sales and management personnel 
competition for skilled candidates is particularly severe where our operations are based 
if we fail to attract  motivate and retain enough skilled employees  our product development efforts may be delayed and the quality of our customer service may decline 
our recent growth has placed a significant strain on our management systems and resources and our planned future growth may put a similar strain on our management systems and resources and our ability to support our customers 
as we continue to increase the scope of our operations  our headcount continues to grow 
our total number of employees increased from as of december   to as of december  our productivity  the quality of our products and our customer support may be seriously harmed if we do not integrate  train and motivate our new employees quickly and effectively 
we also cannot be sure that our revenue will continue to grow at a sufficient rate to absorb the costs associated with a larger overall headcount  as well as training and recruiting expenses 

table of contents we expect that any future growth we experience will continue to place a significant strain on our management systems and resources 
to manage the anticipated growth of our operations  we will be required to hire  train  manage and retain additional qualified personnel  especially software engineers and functional verification engineers  improve existing and implement new operational  financial and management information controls  reporting systems and procedures  and establish and maintain relationships with additional external sales and marketing channel participants  including those enrolled in our strategic programs such as pure ip  verification alliance and licensee 
our continued expansion in international markets will result in higher personnel costs and could reduce our operating margins due to the higher costs of international sales 
in order to significantly penetrate international markets  we plan to expand our international sales efforts 
as we expand our direct international sales organization  we will incur higher personnel costs that may not result in additional revenue 
to the extent we rely on independent sales representatives and distributors to expand our international sales channels  we will be exposed to the risk that our revenue may decline if they do not continue to distribute our products 
even if we increase our revenue by increasing international sales  we may not realize corresponding growth in operating margins  due to the higher costs of these sales 
our revenue from customers outside north america represented of our total revenue in  of our total revenue in and of our total revenue in we may not be able to increase our revenue at rates that meet the expectations of investment analysts and others  which may cause the market price of our ordinary shares to decline 
we may not be able to exceed or maintain our historical rates of revenue growth in or in the future 
as our revenue base grows larger  it will be difficult to maintain high percentage increases over time 
further  our customers have continued to elect time based licenses over perpetual licenses 
our revenue from time based licenses is generally recognized ratably over the term of the licenses  whereas revenue from perpetual licenses tends to be recognized proportionally earlier in the license term 
this ratable revenue recognition tends to moderate increases and decreases in revenue reported  relative to the underlying customers orders 
any significant decrease in our rate of revenue growth would likely result in the market price of our ordinary shares to decline because our revenue may fail to meet the expectations of investment analysts and others 
our products could contain defects  which may reduce sales of those products or result in claims against us 
we develop complex and evolving products designed for use in highly technical environments 
despite testing  errors may be found in our existing or new products 
this could result in  among other things  a delay in recognition or loss of revenue  loss of market share or failure to achieve market acceptance 
furthermore  our customers license our products in order to identify design flaws in their system  ic and ip core designs 
design flaws that are not identified can be very costly  both in terms of direct remanufacturing costs and strategic opportunity costs 
although our standard license agreement contains limitations on liability and some warranty disclaimers  we may be subject to material claims by our customers if our products fail to identify design flaws due to actual or alleged defects in our products  particularly in the case of customers that have acquired rights to use our products without signing license agreements 
in addition  we cannot be certain that the limitations on liability and warranty disclaimers included in our license agreements are enforceable 
although we maintain 
table of contents general business liability insurance  it would not cover a large product liability claim  so we would be required to pay legal expenses to defend the claim as well as uncovered damages awards resulting from a claim successfully brought against us 
in the event of a successful product liability claim made against us  we cannot be certain that we would have financial resources in an amount sufficient to pay the resultant damages award 
we may seek to expand our business through acquisitions or joint ventures that could result in diversion of resources and extra expenses  which could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition 
we completed our first acquisition  of surefire verification  inc  in november cadence design systems and synopsys each acquired their functional verification products by acquiring smaller companies that originally developed those products 
there are many companies developing point solutions that are complementary to verisity and consolidation is a common outcome of new technology development in the electronic design automation industry 
we may in the future decide to pursue acquisitions of businesses  products and technologies or establish joint venture arrangements  which could expand our business 
the negotiation of potential acquisitions or joint ventures as well as the integration of an acquired or jointly developed business  technology  service or product could divert our management s time and our resources 
future acquisitions could result in additional operating expenses without additional revenue  potential dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities  write off of goodwill and amortization of other intangibles  research and development write offs  and other acquisition related expenses 
we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired business or joint ventures with our operations 
if any acquisition or joint venture were to occur  we may not receive the intended benefits of the acquisition or joint venture 
in addition  future acquisitions may disrupt our operations and our business may suffer 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property adequately  we will have fewer competitive barriers  which could reduce our revenue 
our patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secrets and similar intellectual property are critical to our success 
we rely on a combination of nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions  as well as patent  trademark  copyright and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary rights 
as of january   the united states patent and trademark office  known as the uspto  has granted of our patents on various aspects of our technology 
we have an additional pending united states patent applications  pending european patent applications  pending patent cooperation treaty patent applications  israeli patent applications and one japanese patent application 
we face the risks that our patent applications may not be allowed  that any patents we hold may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  and that any claims allowed from our patents will not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to us 
in addition  the laws of foreign countries may not adequately protect our intellectual property as well as the laws of the united states 
we generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  consultants and participants in our strategic programs  and generally seek to control access to our intellectual property and the distribution of our functional verification products  documentation and other proprietary information 
however  we believe that these measures afford only limited protection 
others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology or design around the copyrights and trade secrets we own and the patents we may own in the future 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy 
table of contents or otherwise improperly obtain and use our products or technology 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult and expensive 
our means of protecting our proprietary rights may be inadequate 
to the extent we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights  our competitors would have an easier time competing with us by incorporating aspects of our technology within their products  which could seriously harm our revenue and our ability to become profitable 
third parties may claim we are infringing upon their intellectual property rights  and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from licensing our technology 
substantial litigation and threats of litigation regarding intellectual property rights exist in our industry 
we expect that functional verification products may be increasingly subject to third party infringement claims as the number of competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
we are not aware that our products employ technology that infringes any valid proprietary rights of third parties 
however  third parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property rights 
any claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming to defend  result in costly litigation or damage awards  divert our management s attention and resources  cause product shipment delays  or require us to seek to enter into royalty or licensing agreements  which may not be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
a successful claim of intellectual property infringement against us or our failure or inability to license the infringed or similar technology could seriously harm our business and financial prospects because we would not be able to sell the impacted product without exposing ourselves to litigation risk and damages 
although we maintain general business liability insurance  our coverage does not extend to intellectual property infringement claims  so we would be required to pay legal expenses to defend those claims as well as any damages award resulting from claims successfully made against us 
furthermore  redevelopment of the product so as to avoid infringement could cause us to incur significant additional expense and delay 
if united states tax authorities successfully challenge the structure of our worldwide operations  our tax expense will increase and our ability to attain or maintain profitability will be materially harmed 
we have structured our operations in a manner designed to enable us  if we attain profitability  to benefit from tax incentives and lower income tax rates extended by some countries to encourage investment 
if these tax incentives are not renewed upon expiration  if the tax rates applicable to us are rescinded or changed  or if tax authorities successfully challenge the manner in which profits are recognized among our subsidiaries  our taxes would increase and our results of operations  cash flow and debt service ability would be adversely affected 
some of the employees of our united states subsidiary serve as members of our management team 
we nevertheless believe that any profits we may generate from our israeli operations will not be sufficiently connected to the united states to give rise to united states federal or state taxation 
however  we cannot be certain that this will be the case  and if the united states federal or state tax authorities were to determine otherwise  such that our israeli profits become subject to united states federal or state income taxes  our worldwide effective tax rate could increase and our results of operations  cash flow and debt service ability could be materially harmed 
the expansion of our operations in north america and europe may increase our worldwide effective tax rate 

table of contents because we are incorporated in israel and perform most of our research and development activities there  potential political  economic or military instability in israel or in the region may harm our business and operations 
we are incorporated under the laws of the state of israel and our principal research and development facilities and the corporate headquarters of verisity ltd 
are located in israel 
continued political and economic instability or armed conflicts in israel or in the region  including potential international conflict with iraq  could directly harm our business and operations 
since the establishment of the state of israel in  a number of armed conflicts have taken place between israel and its arab neighbors  and a state of hostility has existed in varying degrees and intensity 
this state of hostility has led to security and economic problems for israel 
the future of peace efforts between israel and its arab neighbors  particularly in light of the recent violence and political unrest in israel and the rest of the middle east  remains uncertain and several countries still restrict business with israel and israeli companies 
these restrictive laws and policies may also materially harm our operating results and financial condition 
israel s economy has been subject to numerous destabilizing factors  including a period of rampant inflation in the early to mid s  low foreign exchange reserves  fluctuations in world commodity prices  military conflicts and civil unrest 
in addition  israel and companies doing business with israel have been the subject of an economic boycott by the arab countries since israel s establishment 
these restrictions and policies may have an adverse impact on our operating results  financial condition or the expansion of our business 
our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially harmed by any major hostilities involving israel  the interruption or curtailment of trade between israel and its trading partners  a significant increase in inflation  a significant downturn in the economic or financial condition of israel or international conflicts involving the region 
some of our executive officers and employees are required to perform military service  and this could force them to be absent  depriving us of their services and our operations may be materially harmed 
some of our executive officers and employees are obligated to perform annual military reserve duty in the israeli army and are subject to being called to active duty at any time  which could adversely affect our ability to pursue our planned research and development efforts 
we cannot assess the full impact of these requirements on our workforce or business and we cannot predict the effect of any expansion or reduction of these obligations on us 
however  in light of the recent violence and political unrest in israel and the rest of the middle east  there is an increased risk that a number of our employees could be called to active military duty without prior notice 
because our revenue is mainly generated in united states dollars and a significant portion of our expenses are incurred in new israeli shekels and to a lesser extent european currencies  our results of operations may be materially harmed by inflation and currency fluctuations 
we generate most of our revenue in united states dollars or other currencies linked to the dollar  but we incur a significant portion of our expenses  principally salaries and related personnel expenses  in shekels and to a lesser extent european currencies 
as a result  we are exposed to the risk that the rate of inflation in israel will exceed the rate of devaluation of the shekel in relation to the dollar or that the timing of any devaluation may lag behind inflation in israel 
if the dollar costs of our operations in israel or europe increase  our dollar measured results of operation would be materially harmed 
our operations also could be materially harmed if we are unable to protect ourselves against currency fluctuations in the future 
accordingly  we may enter into currency hedging transactions to decrease the risk of financial exposure fluctuations in the exchange rate of the dollar against the shekel or other foreign currencies 
these measures  however  may not adequately protect us from material harm due to the impact of inflation in israel or other currency fluctuations 

table of contents the tax benefits we are currently entitled to from the government of israel may be reduced or terminated in the future 
pursuant to the law for the encouragement of capital investments  the government of israel through the investment center has granted approved enterprise status to a significant portion of our research and development efforts 
the portion of our income derived from our approved enterprise program will be exempt from tax for a period of two years commencing in the first year in which we have taxable income and will be subject to a reduced tax for a period of three to eight additional years 
the benefits available to an approved enterprise are conditioned upon the fulfillment of conditions regarding a required amount of investments in fixed assets and a portion of these investments being made with net proceeds of equity capital raised by us as stipulated in applicable law and in the specific certificates of approval 
if we fail to comply with these conditions  in whole or in part  we may be required to pay additional taxes for the period in which we benefited from the tax exemption or reduced tax rates and would likely be denied these benefits in the future 
from time to time  the government of israel has discussed reducing or eliminating the benefits available under the approved enterprise program 
it is possible that these tax benefits may not be continued in the future at their current levels or at all 
our share price has been volatile and could drop unexpectedly 
the price at which our ordinary shares trade has been and is likely to continue to be volatile 
the stock market from time to time experiences significant price and volume fluctuations that affect the market prices of securities  particularly securities of technology and computer software companies 
as a result  investors may experience a significant decline in the market price of our ordinary shares  regardless of our operating performance 
price declines in our stock could result from many factors outside of our control  including announcements by our competitors of financial results  acquisitions  new products or technological innovations  announcements by our customers of poor financial results  layoffs or discontinuance of business programs or segments 
disputes concerning patents or other proprietary rights  political conditions  particularly in israel  and general market conditions 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company 
we may become involved in this type of litigation in the future 
litigation of this type  regardless of its merit  is often extremely expensive and diverts management s attention and resources 
recently enacted and proposed changes in securities laws and regulations are likely to increase our costs 
the sarbanes oxley act of that became law in july requires changes in some of our corporate governance and securities disclosure or compliance practices 
that act also requires the sec to promulgate new rules on a variety of subjects  in addition to rule proposals already made  and nasdaq has proposed revisions to its requirements for companies that are nasdaq listed 
we expect these developments to increase our legal compliance costs  and to make some activities more difficult to complete 
it is possible these developments will make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance 
we are presently evaluating and monitoring regulatory developments and cannot estimate the timing or magnitude of additional costs we may incur as a result
