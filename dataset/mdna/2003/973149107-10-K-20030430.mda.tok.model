see also item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation factors that may affect future results numerous factors may cause our total revenues and operating results to fluctuate significantly from period to period 
competition the embedded software industry is highly competitive 
see factors that may affect future results we face intense competition in the embedded software industry  which could decrease demand for our products or cause us to reduce our prices under item for a further description of factors that may impact our competitive position 
our primary competition comes from internal research and development departments of companies that develop embedded systems in house 
in many cases  companies that develop embedded systems in house have already made significant investments of time and effort in developing their own internal systems  making acceptance of our products as a replacement more difficult 
additionally  many of these in house departments may increasingly choose to use open source software  such as the linux operating system 
we also compete with independent software vendors  including enea ose systems ab  green hills software  inc  mentor graphics  microsoft corporation and qnx software systems  ltd  as well as a number of other vendors that address one or more segments of the embedded system design process 
to a limited extent  we also compete with vendors of linux based products such as metrowerks a subsidiary of motorola  inc  red hat  inc 
and montavista software  inc some of the companies that develop embedded systems in house and some of these independent software vendors  such as microsoft corporation  may have significantly greater financial  technical  marketing  sales and other resources and significantly greater name recognition than we do 
we believe that the primary competitive factors in the industry center around the way customers and potential customers manage their process of software development 
key factors driving their approach to software development include managing limited internal resources  controlling costs  minimizing development time and limiting their risks 
as a result  the major competitive factors in our industry are reliability  performance  price and customer support 
we believe that we compete favorably with respect to each of these factors 
product development and engineering we believe that our success will continue to depend primarily on our ability to maintain and enhance our current product line  develop new products  maintain technological competitiveness and meet an ever expanding range of customer and market requirements 
as of january   our product development and engineering group included full time employees 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we implemented a restructuring program that included a reduction in force  and notified approximately employees in the product development and engineering group that their employment would terminate  generally during the first quarter of fiscal during fiscal  and  product development and engineering expenses were million  million  and million  respectively  excluding capitalized software development costs 
during the fiscal years ended january   and  we incurred product and development and engineering expenses that qualified for capitalization of   and million  respectively 
see strategic alliances above for information on research and development funded by third parties through our center of excellence program 
proprietary rights our success is heavily dependent upon our proprietary technology 
to protect our proprietary rights  we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trade secret and trademark laws 
as a part of our regular business processes  we generally enter into nondisclosure agreements with employees  consultants  distributors  customers and corporate partners  as appropriate  and thereby limit access to and distribution of our software  documentation and other proprietary information 
furthermore  our licensing agreements provide for protection of our intellectual property both in terms of source code handling and underlying intellectual property ownership of modifications to the wind river code 
see factors that may affect future results the rights we rely upon to protect the intellectual property underlying our products may not be adequate  which could enable third parties to use our technology and reduce our ability to compete under item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
wind river and the wind river logo are registered trademarks in the united states and other countries worldwide 
we have used  registered  and or applied to register specific trademarks and service marks to distinguish many of our products  technologies and services from those of our competitors in the us and in foreign countries and jurisdictions 
we enforce our trademark  service mark and trade name rights in the us and abroad 
we have filed and obtained a number of patents and patent applications in the united states and abroad that relate to various aspects of our products and technology 
as of january   we held issued patents in the united states  none of which have expired 
the expiration dates of these patents range from to while we believe that patent protection of our products is important  any patents obtained may not provide substantial protection or be of commercial benefit to us 
it is also possible that their validity will be challenged 
manufacturing our manufacturing operation consists of assembling  packaging and shipping the software products and documentation needed to fulfill each order 
outside vendors provide tape and cd duplication  printing of documentation and manufacturing of packaging materials 
we also manufacture and assemble our hardware development tools at our factory in canton  massachusetts and at certain subcontractor facilities 
we do not believe that backlog is a meaningful indicator of sales that can be expected in future periods  particularly in view of the fast pace of technological change in the software industry 
employees as of january   we had  employees  including in sales and marketing  in professional services and support activities  in product development and engineering and in management  operations  finance and administration 
of these employees   were located in north america and were located outside of north america 
none of our employees is represented by a labor union or is subject to a collective bargaining agreement 
we have never experienced a work stoppage 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we implemented a restructuring program that included a reduction in force  and notified approximately employees across all business functions that their employment would terminate  generally in the quarter ending april  our employees are vital to our success  and our key management  engineering  sales and other employees are difficult to replace 
we generally do not have employment contracts with our key employees or maintain key person life insurance on any of our employees 
if we are unable to attract  assimilate  retain or motivate highly qualified technical and sales employees in the future through competitive compensation and employment policies  our ability to develop and introduce competitive new products in a timely manner may suffer

concurrently  wind river and the doj entered into a consent decree settling the lawsuit against wind river 
pursuant to the consent decree  wind river agreed that in the event the department obtains a final judgment against tmw requiring a divestiture of the matrixx software  wind river would cooperate fully to effect the divestiture 
pursuant to a separate consent decree entered into between the doj and tmw  wind river and tmw completed the divestiture in january in march  the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia approved the settlement reached between the doj and wind river

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview wind river is a leading supplier of embedded software and services for embedded systems 
an embedded system consists of a microprocessor  or a series of microprocessors  and related software and is used to control  monitor or assist the operation of electronic devices  equipment and machinery 
embedded systems are used in diverse products such as digital imaging products  auto braking systems  internet routers  jet fighter control panels and factory automation devices 
our products help customers to enhance product performance  standardize designs across projects  reduce research and development costs and shorten product development cycles 
we sell our products to customers in a variety of markets  including the aerospace and defense  automotive  digital consumer  industrial measurement and networking markets 
recent events in november  we introduced our integrated embedded platforms  in which we bundle our software technology into market specific platforms and license these platforms using an enterprise license model 
these market specific platforms include a combination of development tools  an operating system and various protocols and interfaces 
under the enterprise license model  we license these market specific platforms under an annual subscription based development license and aggregated production licenses  while eliminating our traditional project and site restrictions 
see item  business products and services for further information on our integrated embedded platform products 
during the transition of our business model from project based licensing to the enterprise license model  we expect the timing of our reported revenue to be impacted because under the enterprise license model revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription period 
at the end of the subscription period the customer s usage rights to the products expire unless renewed 
by contrast  our traditional project based license requires a majority of license revenue to be recognized in the quarter in which the products are delivered and a much smaller amount relating to the fair value of the maintenance being deferred and recognized subsequently over the maintenance period 
therefore  an order for a subscription license will result in lower current quarter revenue than an equal sized order for a project based license 
as a result  the impact on near term and deferred revenue will depend on the rate at which customers transition from our project based model to our enterprise license model 
to the extent that the adoption rate is higher than we expect  we may experience a greater decline in near term revenue  as well as an increase in deferred revenue 
due to a combination of our transition to the enterprise license model  general economic factors affecting the technology sector and the impact of seasonality on our first quarter revenues  we believe that our reported revenue will decline in the first quarter of fiscal  as compared to both the fourth quarter of fiscal and the first quarter of fiscal see results of operations revenues for further information on our revenue expectations 
see also  factors that may affect future operating results we have recently adopted a new business model including a new type of licensing arrangement  and cannot be sure that the new model will be successful for a discussion of risks associated with the adoption of the enterprise license model 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we implemented a restructuring plan  which included a reduction in force of approximately full time equivalent employee positions as well as the implementation of other cost control measures such as facilities closures 
in connection with the restructuring  we recorded a net charge of million during the fourth quarter of fiscal additionally  as a result of the restructuring plan  we undertook an impairment review of our intangible assets during the fourth quarter of fiscal and recorded a charge of million 
see results of operations years ended january  and restructuring and other costs below for more information on our restructuring plan  and results of operations years ended january  and impairment of goodwill and purchased intangibles below for more information regarding the impairment review 
on march   we announced a voluntary stock option exchange program for employees 
under the program  eligible employees were offered the opportunity to exchange outstanding options to purchase million shares of wind river common stock with exercise prices equal to or greater than per share for new stock options to be granted at least six months and one day after the existing options are cancelled 
the number of shares subject to the new options will depend on the applicable exchange ratio determined by the exercise price of the exchanged stock options and the number of participating employees 
participating employees will receive new stock options in exchange for outstanding stock options at an exchange ratio of either for  for  or for  depending on exercise price of the exchanged stock option 
in accordance with the program  on april   we cancelled outstanding options to purchase approximately million shares of our common stock 
we expect to grant new options to purchase a total of approximately million shares of wind river common stock no earlier than october   which is the first business day that is six months and one day after the cancellation of the exchanged options  but no later than november  the exercise price per share of the new options will be equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant as determined in accordance with our applicable option plans 
based on the number of options cancelled and the applicable exchange ratios  the new stock options represent approximately of the total shares of our common stock outstanding as of april   and could have a dilutive impact on our future earnings per share 
in september and november  we entered into two operating leases for our headquarters facility constructed on land owned by us in alameda  california 
in january  we notified the lessor of our intent to exercise the purchase option under the leases  and  in april  we completed the transactions  terminated the operating leases and purchased the buildings for million 
in connection with the termination of these operating leases  in april  we entered into a loan facility for a total commitment of million  of which we have drawn million 
see liquidity and capital resources commitments below for more information about the exercise of the purchase options under these operating leases and the loan facility 
critical accounting policies and estimates the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which requires us to make estimates and assumptions 
note  summary of significant accounting policies in notes to the consolidated financial statements describes our significant accounting policies 
however  those policies and estimates that we believe are most critical to an understanding of our financial results and condition and that require a higher degree of judgment and complexity are as follows and are discussed below 
revenue recognition estimating sales returns and other allowances  and allowance for doubtful accounts valuation of investments and long lived assets  including goodwill and purchased intangibles restructuring charges accounting for income taxes revenue recognition we derive revenues from two sources i product revenues and ii service revenues 
product revenues consist of royalties and fees for operating systems and fees for the use of development tools 
we license our software products under perpetual licenses as well as time based term licenses  such as the subscription based arrangements in our newly introduced integrated embedded platform products 
service revenues are derived from fees from professional services  which include design and development fees  software maintenance contracts  and customer training and consulting 
maintenance contract renewals are generally sold separately from our products 
our customers consist of end users  distributors  original equipment manufacturers  system integrators and value added resellers 
agreements generally do not allow the right of return or sales price adjustments 
we recognize revenues in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended sop  sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  sop  and staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition sab 
we recognize revenues when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the vendor s fee is fixed or determinable and vendor specific objective evidence vsoe exists to allocate the total fee to all undelivered elements of the arrangement and collection is determined to be probable 
these four criteria are further defined as follows persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
it is our customary practice to have written non cancelable contracts and a customer purchase order prior to recognizing revenues on an arrangement 
delivery has occurred 
product revenues for software and hardware are recognized at the time of shipment or upon the delivery of a product master  with standard transfer terms of fob shipping point 
if undelivered products or services exist that are essential to the functionality of the delivered product in an arrangement  delivery is not considered to have occurred 
if only non essential products or services are undelivered and if evidence of fair value of all undelivered elements exists  then revenue is recognized using the residual method 
under the residual method  the recognition of fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue 
we recognize revenues from one year time based and subscription based licenses ratably over the term of the agreement 
for multi year time based licenses  we defer recognition of the fees associated with the vsoe of the maintenance and support over the term of the license and recognize the residual contract amount in the period in which the agreement is signed  so long as we have vsoe for undelivered elements  which typically consist of maintenance and support 
where vsoe does not exist for undelivered elements  we recognize the fees ratably over the term of the multi year license 
our enterprise license model agreements require that we deliver unspecified future products during the one year term 
accordingly  fees from our enterprise licenses agreements are recognized ratably over their term 
sales to distributors  original equipment manufacturers  system integrators and value added resellers are recognized either at the time the risks of ownership have transferred or upon receipt of royalty reports related to the sale of product to an end user  depending on our historical experience with these customers 
professional service revenues are separately priced  are generally available from a number of suppliers  and are typically not essential to the functionality of our software products 
revenue from these services is recognized separately from the license fee because the arrangements qualify as service transactions as defined by sop generally  revenue from time and materials consulting contracts are recognized as services are performed 
contract accounting is utilized for service revenues from fixed price contracts and those requiring significant software modification  development or customization 
in such instances  the arrangement fee is accounted for in accordance with sop  whereby the arrangement fee is recognized  generally using the percentage of completion method measured on labor input costs 
if increases in projected costs to complete are sufficient to create a loss contract  the entire estimated loss is charged to operations in the period the loss first becomes known 
the complexity of the estimation process and judgments related to the assumptions  risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the percentage of completion method of accounting affect the amounts of revenue and related expenses reported in our consolidated financial statements 
a number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates  including labor rates  utilization  changes to specification and testing requirements and collectibility of unbilled receivables 
service revenues from time and materials professional services contracts are recognized as the services are performed 
service revenues from software maintenance  support and update fees are recognized ratably over the contract period  which in most instances is one year 
service revenues from training and consulting are recognized when the services are provided 
the vendor s fee is fixed or determinable 
at the time of each transaction  we assess whether the fee associated with a revenue transaction is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
if a significant portion of a fee is due after our standard payment terms  which are generally no greater than days from invoice date  we account for the fee as not being fixed or determinable 
in these cases  revenue is recognized as the fees become due 
collection is probable 
we assess probability of collection based on a number of factors  including our past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
new customers and certain existing customers are subject to a credit review process that evaluates each customer s financial position and ultimately its ability to pay according to the original terms of the arrangement 
based on our review process  if it is determined from the outset of an arrangement that collection of the resulting receivable is not probable  then revenue is recognized on a cash collected basis 
significant management judgments and estimates are made in connection with the revenues recognized in any accounting period 
we must assess whether the fee associated with a revenue transaction is fixed or determinable and whether or not collection is probable and  for fixed price contracts  make estimates of costs to complete 
material differences could result in the amount and timing of revenues for any period if management were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates 
estimating sales returns and other allowances  and allowance for doubtful accounts we record estimated reductions in revenue for potential returns of products by customers and other allowances 
as a result  management must make estimates of potential future product returns and other allowances related to current period product revenue 
in making such estimates  management analyzes historical returns  current economic trends and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products 
if management were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates  material differences in the amount of reported revenue could result 
the provision for sales returns is recorded as an offset to revenue 
similarly  management makes estimates of the uncollectability of accounts receivables  specifically analyzing accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms  when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
in addition to the identification of specific doubtful accounts receivable  we provide allowances for approximately of other accounts receivable 
if management were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates  material differences in the amount of our reported operating expenses could result 
valuation of investments and long lived assets  including goodwill and purchased intangibles our long lived assets include goodwill and other purchased intangible assets  which totaled million and million as of january  and  respectively 
in determining the fair value of these assets  we assess the recoverability of goodwill and other purchased intangibles 
that assessment requires that management make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows associated with such assets and other factors 
we review such assets for impairment when a change in circumstances indicates a potential decline in value and  if they are determined to be impaired  we record an impairment charge 
the impairment charge for assets held for use is determined based upon the estimated discounted cash flows over the remaining useful life of the goodwill and other intangibles using an appropriate discount rate that incorporates our cost of capital and the risk profile of the associated investment 
the assumptions supporting the cash flows  including the discount rates  are determined using our best estimates as of the date of the impairment review 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record additional impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
during fiscal and  we recorded an aggregate charge of million and million  respectively  related to impairment of goodwill and purchased intangibles 
for details about the impairment charges we recorded during fiscal and  please see results of operations years ended january  and impairment of goodwill and purchased intangibles below 
we have made long term minority investments in a number of private and publicly traded companies 
we record an impairment charge when an investment has experienced a decline in value that is judged to be other than temporary 
we monitor our investments for impairment by considering current factors  including economic environment  market conditions and the operational performance and other specific factors relating to the business underlying the investment 
as of january   we had no remaining investment book value on our balance sheet relating to private companies and our public investments have a fair value of approximately  restructuring charges restructuring charges are comprised primarily of severance and associated employee termination costs related to the reduction of our workforce in fiscal and  and costs associated with the consolidation of excess facilities 
we account for each of these costs in accordance with staff accounting bulletin  restructuring and impairment charges sab 
in addition  we account for the individual components of our restructuring activities as discussed further below 
we account for the costs associated with the reduction of our workforce in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring eitf and sab accordingly  we record the liability related to these termination costs when the following conditions have been met i management with the appropriate level of authority approves a termination plan that commits us to such plan and establishes the benefits the employees will receive upon termination  ii the benefit arrangement is communicated to the employees in sufficient detail to enable the employees to determine the termination benefits  iii the plan specifically identifies the number of employees to be terminated  their locations and their job classifications  and iv the period of time to implement the plan does not indicate changes to the plan are likely 
the termination costs recorded by us are not associated with nor do they benefit continuing activities 
we account for the costs associated with the consolidation of excess facilities in accordance with eitf issue no 
 costs associated with lease modifications or termination eitf 
accordingly  we record the costs associated with excess facilities when the related leased property has no substantive future use or benefit to us 
our estimated excess facility costs represent the remaining lease payments and estimated costs less estimated proceeds from sub leasing certain facilities 
the estimated proceeds from sub leasing these facilities are based on current comparable rates for leases in the respective markets 
the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for exit or disposal activities sfas  on january  had no impact on our previously accrued costs associated with our restructuring plans 
inherent in the estimation of the costs related to our restructuring efforts are assessments related to the most likely expected outcome of the significant actions to accomplish the restructuring 
in determining our restructuring charges  the majority of estimates made by management related to our charges for excess facilities 
in determining the charge for excess facilities  we were required to estimate future sublease income  negotiated lease settlement costs  future net operating expenses of the facilities  and brokerage commissions  among other expenses 
these estimates  along with other estimates made by management in connection with our restructuring  may vary significantly depending  in part  on factors that may be beyond our control 
specifically  these estimates will depend on our success in negotiating with lessors  the time periods required to locate and contract suitable subleases and the market rates at the time of such subleases 
adjustments to our reserve for the consolidation of excess facilities will be required if actual lease exit costs or sublease income differ from amounts currently expected 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a reversal of million against the original million charge recorded in the second quarter of fiscal after we determined that it would be more efficient and cost effective if certain of such excess facilities continued to be used by wind river personnel 
we review the status of our restructuring activities on a quarterly basis and  if appropriate  record changes to our restructuring obligations as part of operating expenses based on management s most current estimates 
accounting for income taxes significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward and foreign tax credits  before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which these deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
should we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax asset in the foreseeable future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
acquisitions during the last few years we have completed several acquisitions that have allowed us to pursue our strategy of adding key businesses and technologies to develop more complete solutions for our customers and to retain our competitive advantage in the market place 
major business acquisitions during recent fiscal years are discussed in the following paragraphs

on october   we purchased the assets of the telenetworks division of next level communications  inc telenetworks  for a total net purchase price of million  consisting of approximately million in net cash and  in acquisition costs 
results of operations beginning in fiscal and continuing throughout fiscal  we were significantly impacted by the general economic downturn  which has been especially pronounced in the high technology sector generally and the telecommunications sector in particular 
our total revenues decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal and decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal our net loss was million  or a net loss of per share  for fiscal compared to a net loss of million  or a net loss of per share  for fiscal and a net loss of million  or a net loss of per share  for fiscal on february   we adopted sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas and  accordingly  we did not amortize any goodwill in fiscal if we had not amortized goodwill in fiscal  net loss would have been million  or net loss per share 
if we had not amortized goodwill in fiscal  net income would have been million  or per basic share and per diluted share 
our results of operations presented below have been restated to include the historical financial information of integrated systems  which was acquired in a transaction accounted for as a pooling of interests

product revenues consist of royalties and fees for integrated embedded platforms  operating systems  hardware  licenses  and fees for the use of development tools 
service revenues are derived from fees from professional services  which include design and development fees  software maintenance contracts  and customer training and consulting 
we accrue for sales returns and other allowances based on historical experience 
total revenues were million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease in total revenues of in fiscal is due to a decline in product and service revenues resulting primarily from the current economic downturn in the high technology sector 
this downturn has affected us both directly  by decreasing our sales  and indirectly  because our products are incorporated into our customers products  and as our customers sales decline  our royalty revenue declines as well 
product revenues decreased to million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal our product revenues  excluding run time royalties  decreased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal run time royalties declined to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal product revenues accounted for approximately and of total revenues in fiscal and  respectively 
the general decline in product revenues is primarily due to lower customer demand for hardware and software products  including run time royalties  which are generally tied to the number of products deployed  largely as a result of the current economic downturn in the high technology sector 
during fiscal and  some of our customers have decreased research and development budgets  sought to increase the value they receive from vendors  including us  attempted to leverage a more competitive bidding process when spending research and development budgets  and or deferred or canceled projects  in whole or in part 
as a result of these factors  we believe that some of our customers have undertaken development in house  selected solutions they perceive to be less expensive or have relied on existing licenses rather than making new product purchases from us 
also  we cannot anticipate or calculate the potential adverse impact of open source or in house software on our revenues or market share particularly where our customer s budget constraints may make such software  which is royalty free  more appealing than wind river products for their initial project development 
service revenues decreased to million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to lower customer demand for maintenance  consulting and training services primarily as a result of the current economic downturn in the high technology sector 
maintenance revenues decreased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal other service revenues  which include training  engineering and professional services  declined to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal service revenues accounted for approximately and of total revenues in fiscal and  respectively 
revenues from international sales decreased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the overall decrease was due to a decline in revenues from japan  a decrease in revenues from europe including the middle east and africa  emea  and a decrease in revenues from asia pacific 
revenues in japan were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal revenues in emea were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal revenues in asia pacific were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease in international revenues resulted primarily from macro economic factors that have caused our customers to reduce research and development spending and purchase fewer wind river products and services 
additionally  many of our customers are large multinational corporations that have reduced capital spending across all geographic regions 
overall  however  international sales were not as adversely affected by the decrease in customer spending as were sales in north america during fiscal as a result  international revenues accounted for of total revenues in fiscal  compared to of total revenues for fiscal we expect international sales to continue to represent a significant portion of revenues  although the actual percentage may fluctuate from period to period 
our international sales are mostly denominated in local currencies 
as a result of our transition to the enterprise license model  the continuing decline in general economic factors affecting the high technology sector and the impact of seasonality on our first quarter revenues  we believe that our reported revenue will decline in the first quarter of fiscal  which ends on april   as compared to both the quarter ended january  and the first quarter of fiscal ended april  we cannot predict how long or severe the current economic downturn will be or whether any actions taken by the government will be effective to bolster the economy 
as a result of this uncertainty  forecasting and financial and strategic planning are more difficult than usual 
if the downturn continues for an extended period or becomes more severe  our business will suffer and we may experience additional declines in sales  as well as continued losses  as our customers attempt to limit their spending 
in addition  the adverse impact of the downturn on the capital markets could impair our ability to raise capital as needed and impede our ability to expand our business

cost of revenues the overall cost of products and services as a percentage of total revenues was in fiscal compared to in fiscal cost of products was million and million in fiscal and  respectively  reflecting a decrease of from fiscal to fiscal product related cost of revenues as a percentage of product revenues was in both fiscal and product related costs consist primarily of salaries and benefits for production employees  other direct production costs  amortization of capitalized software development costs  royalty payments to third parties for the use of their software  and shipping costs 
the decline in product related costs in absolute dollars in fiscal was primarily due to lower amortization expense relating to capitalized software development costs and lower third party royalty costs 
amortization of capitalized software development costs included in cost of products for fiscal and amounted to  and million  respectively  third party royalty costs included in cost of products for fiscal and were million and million  respectively  and direct production costs included in costs of products for fiscal and were million and million  respectively 
product related cost of revenues may be affected in the future by the amortization of capitalized software development costs  costs of distribution related to the introduction of new products and by royalty costs for use of third party software in our products 
cost of services was million and million in fiscal and  respectively  a decrease of 
service related cost of revenues as a percentage of service revenues was in fiscal compared to in fiscal service related cost of revenues consist primarily of personnel related costs associated with providing services  including consulting services  to customers and the infrastructure to manage a services organization  as well as costs to recruit  develop  and retain services professionals 
the decrease in absolute dollars of service costs in fiscal was primarily due to reduced use of outside consultants and a reduction of full time employees as part of the restructuring programs implemented 
due to the restructuring programs and other cost savings measures  we realized cost reductions of million in professional service costs relating primarily to internal payroll and external contractor costs  million in maintenance costs and million in training costs in fiscal the increase in service related costs as a percentage of service revenues in fiscal was due to a greater decline in the service revenues than the decline in fixed costs associated with customer support  personnel and certified third party contractors within our professional services organization 
we expect that the cost of service revenues will increase in absolute dollars in the long term as we continue to increase our professional service organization and customer support capabilities 
additionally  we expect cost of services to fluctuate as a percentage of service revenue based on our ability to utilize our professional services organization 
operating expenses selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses were million and million in fiscal and  respectively  reflecting a decrease of from fiscal to fiscal as a percentage of total revenues  selling and marketing expenses were in fiscal compared to in fiscal the decrease in absolute dollars of selling and marketing expenses was attributable to lower sales commission expenses as a result of decreased sales volume and decreased expenditures relating to our restructuring programs implemented during fiscal and  including reduced expenditures for salaries and related fringe costs  travel  trade shows  and rent and utilities 
sales commission costs decreased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal salaries and related fringe costs decreased by million  travel expenses decreased by million  trade show expenses decreased by million and rent and utilities decreased by million  in fiscal compared to fiscal although selling and marketing expenses decreased in absolute dollars in fiscal  these expenses as a percentage of revenue increased because expenses declined at a lower rate than revenues 
in addition  bad debt expense decreased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal the higher level of bad debt expense in fiscal was primarily due to an increase in our exposure from customers who filed for bankruptcy during that year 
we believe selling and marketing expenses in absolute dollars will not increase significantly in the short term 
however  we do expect an increase in absolute dollars in the long term  as we continue to focus on long term growth in the areas of sales and marketing personnel and marketing and advertising programs 
product development and engineering expenses 
product development and engineering expenses were million and million in fiscal and  respectively  reflecting a decrease of from fiscal to fiscal as a percentage of total revenues  product development and engineering expenses were in fiscal compared to in fiscal the decrease in product development and engineering expenses was primarily due to cost control measures relating to our restructuring programs 
salaries and fringe costs decreased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal although product development and engineering expenses decreased in absolute dollars in fiscal  these expenses as a percentage of revenue increased because expenses declined at a lower rate than revenues 
we believe that product development and engineering expenses in absolute dollars will not increase significantly in the short term 
however  we do expect an increase in absolute dollars in the long term  as we continue to focus on long term growth in the areas of research and development 
in addition  we received million of funded research and development related to our center of excellence and other initiatives in both fiscal years and  which offset a portion of our gross research and development expenses 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million and million in fiscal and  respectively  reflecting a decrease of from fiscal to fiscal as a percentage of total revenues  general and administrative expenses were in fiscal compared to in fiscal general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars declined due to the implementation of our restructuring programs 
salaries and related fringe costs declined by million and our consulting and travel costs decreased by million in fiscal as a result of our efforts to reduce costs 
the increase in expenses as a percentage of total revenues in fiscal was primarily a result of revenues declining at a higher rate than expenses 
we believe that general and administrative expenses will not increase significantly in absolute dollars in the short term as a result of the restructuring programs discussed above 
however  we do expect an increase in absolute dollars in the long term  as we continue to invest in worldwide staff and infrastructure in the areas of information systems and finance and administration  and continue to consolidate the financial  manufacturing  customer relations management and customer support information systems of acquired companies 
we allocate the total costs for information technology  facilities and fixed asset depreciation to each of the functional areas based on certain headcount data 
information technology allocated costs include salaries  information technology  project costs  communication costs and depreciation expense for fixed assets 
facilities allocated costs include facility rent for the corporate offices as well as shared function offices  property taxes  depreciation expenses for office furniture and other department operating costs 
fixed asset depreciation allocated costs include straight line depreciation expense on buildings  leasehold improvements  computer equipment  software  furniture and office equipment 
amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles 
amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles totaled million and million in fiscal and  respectively  reflecting a decrease of from fiscal to fiscal the decrease in amortization in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily related to our adoption of sfas on february  sfas requires that goodwill no longer be amortized  but continue to be evaluated for impairment 
during the year ended january   we recorded amortization of goodwill of million and amortized million of acquired workforce previously classified as purchased intangible assets  under the accounting rules applicable to that period 
acquisition related costs reversals 
acquisition related reversals totaled  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
the acquisition related reversals in fiscal and related to net reversals of  and million  respectively  of excess acquisition related liabilities relating primarily to leasehold properties from our merger with integrated systems 
we were able to sub lease some properties for longer than we had anticipated and were able to exit other leasehold properties earlier than originally estimated 
in addition  the reversal in fiscal was offset in part by  of in process research and development write off associated with the acquisition of the telenetworks assets 
during fiscal  we made payments of  related to excess facility costs 
as of january   we had acquisition related accruals of approximately  remaining  relating primarily to fees for the legal collapse of international subsidiaries 
for further information on the acquisition related costs associated with our merger with integrated systems  inc see the discussion below under years ended january  and acquisition related costs reversals and other 
see also note  acquisitions and dispositions in notes to consolidated financial statements 
in conjunction with our business restructuring and impairment review discussed below  we re evaluated the assumptions used in determining the value of in process research and development acquired in connection with our purchase acquisitions completed during fiscal see impairment of goodwill and purchased intangibles below for further discussion of our impairment review 
impairment of goodwill and purchased intangibles 
during the second and fourth quarters of both fiscal and fiscal  we identified indicators of possible impairment of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets relating to acquisitions made in earlier years 
these indicators included the deterioration in the business climate  recent changes in sales and cash flow forecasts  revised strategic plans for certain of the acquired businesses and significant declines in the market values of companies in the embedded software industry 
in anticipation of continued customer spending and as part of our strategic plan  we acquired these businesses to complement and extend our product offerings 
since these acquisitions were made  many companies in the high technology and software industries have experienced significant decreases in capital funding and customer spending and  as a result  have curtailed research and development activities 
therefore  revenues associated with these businesses have not met the original expectations at the time of acquisition 
many companies in the high technology and software industries  including wind river  have experienced significant declines in the price of their common stock 
the acquisition of embedded support tools and audesi were paid for in common stock valued at approximately and per share  respectively 
subsequently  our common stock price declined significantly 
as a result  the purchase prices of the embedded support tools and audesi assets are substantially higher than their valuation in the current business environment 
accordingly  we compared the undiscounted cash flows associated with the acquired goodwill and purchased intangible assets with the respective carrying amounts and determined that an impairment of certain of these assets existed 
as a result  we recorded aggregate charges of million and million during fiscal and  respectively 
the entire charge for fiscal of million related to the impairment of purchased intangible assets  million of the charge for fiscal related to the impairment of purchased intangible assets and million of the charge for fiscal related to the impairment of goodwill 
the impaired amount was measured as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeded the present value of the estimated future cash flows for the businesses acquired from which goodwill and purchased intangible assets arose  as follows impairment expense for years ended january  in thousands eonic  telenetworks  embedded support tools  audesi  rapid logic  icesoft  software development systems  inc  total   the impairment review of those assets held for use was determined based upon the estimated discounted cash flows over the remaining useful life of the goodwill and purchased intangibles  using discount rates ranging from to for fiscal and to for fiscal the assumptions supporting the cash flows  including the discount rates  were determined using our best estimate as of the date of the impairment review 
the impairment charge for those assets held for disposal was determined based on the expected proceeds of disposition 
as of january  and  we had net book values of goodwill of million and net book values of purchased intangibles of million and million  respectively 
all identifiable intangible assets  other than goodwill  will continue to be amortized in accordance with sfas see note  acquisitions and dispositions in notes to the consolidated financial statements 
restructuring and other costs 
restructuring and other costs consists of costs of million and million in the years ended january  and  respectively  associated with the restructuring programs we implemented in those years  and costs of million in the year ended january  associated with the settlement of litigation and related remediation efforts 
restructuring costs 
in response to market conditions and the decline in our revenues  in both fiscal and  we implemented restructuring plans that were designed to align our anticipated revenues more closely with our cost structure 
our restructuring plans have been based on certain assumptions regarding the cost structure of our business and the nature and severity of the current industry adjustment and general economic trends  and involved the implementation of a number of initiatives  including headcount reductions  facilities closures  and other cost control measures such as employing a program of office closure days and reducing discretional spending on items such as consulting and travel 
as a result of the headcount reductions  we eliminated an aggregate of  employee positions in fiscal and  which represented approximately one half of our employee base as of the beginning of fiscal our restructuring programs for fiscal were initiated prior to our adoption of sfas and have been accounted for in accordance with the provisions of sab  eitf and eitf for a further discussion of factors that may affect the success of the restructuring program  see factors that may affect future results our restructuring plans may not enable us to achieve profitability in a difficult economic environment or achieve our business objectives 
as a result of the decision to restructure our business  we recorded net restructuring charges of million and million during fiscal and  respectively  which in each case were classified as operating expenses 
as of january   the remaining restructuring liabilities related to the fiscal restructuring programs totaled million 
as of january   there were no remaining restructuring liabilities related to our restructuring programs for fiscal the following table provides detailed restructuring liabilities for the fiscal years ended january  and  and the aggregate remaining restructuring liabilities as of january  work force reduction consolidation of excess facilities other total in thousands fiscal cash charges    non cash charges reversals   total charges    cash payments   non cash write offs restructuring liabilities as of january   fiscal cash charges     non cash charges   reversals  total charges     cash payments    non cash write offs   restructuring liabilities as of january   the worldwide work force reductions implemented in fiscal resulted in the reduction of employees  and were fully completed during fiscal the worldwide work force reductions implemented during fiscal will be substantially completed during the first half of fiscal when completed  the fiscal restructurings will result in the reduction of regular employees from our operations in north america  emea  asia pacific and japan 
each workforce reduction affected  and will affect  all business functions  including sales and marketing  professional services  product development and engineering  and finance and administration 
in addition  we reduced the number of contractors and temporary workers used by us as a result of the fiscal and restructuring programs 
we recorded net work force reduction charges of approximately million and million in fiscal and  respectively  relating primarily to severance payments and the continuation of benefits 
equipment disposed of or removed from operations as a result of the work force reduction resulted in non cash charges of  and  in fiscal and  respectively  and consisted primarily of computer equipment 
we recorded a net restructuring charge of million and million during fiscal and  respectively  relating to the consolidation of certain excess facilities primarily in the united states  japan and europe 
the consolidation of excess facilities includes the closure of certain leased corporate facilities and sales offices that related to business activities that were restructured 
the estimated excess facility costs represent the remaining lease payments and estimated costs less estimated proceeds from sub leasing certain facilities 
the estimated proceeds from sub leasing these facilities are based on current comparable rates for leases in the respective markets 
if rental rates for our leased facilities continue to decrease in these markets or it takes longer than expected to find a suitable tenant to sublease these facilities  the actual loss could exceed this estimate 
cash and non cash charges relate primarily to lease terminations  non cancelable lease costs and impairment of leasehold improvements related to the excess facilities 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a reversal of million against the original million charge recorded in the second quarter of fiscal after we determined that it would be more efficient and cost effective if certain of such excess facilities continued to be used by wind river personnel 
the decision to maintain such facilities was based on changes in the local business environment and lack of competitive leasing rates for new sites 
as a result  we recorded a net charge for excess facilities of million for fiscal  which primarily related to excess facilities located in the united states 
as of january   there were no remaining liabilities relating to excess facilities provided for during the fiscal restructuring 
amounts accrued due to the consolidation of excess facilities as a result of the fiscal restructuring programs will be paid through fiscal  unless we successfully negotiate to exit the leases at an earlier date 
during fiscal  we recorded a restructuring charge of million for other items primarily relating to research and development activities that management decided to discontinue as a result of our restructuring activities 
litigation related costs 
during fiscal  we recorded a charge of million relating to the settlement of litigation with a third party and related remediation efforts 
other income expense interest income 
interest income declined by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease in interest income was primarily due to lower invested balances  lower interest earned on our investments as a result of lower interest rates and higher amortization expense related to our fixed income securities 
total cash and cash equivalents  investments and restricted cash at the end of fiscal and were approximately million and million  respectively 
interest expense 
interest expense declined by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease in interest expense in fiscal was due primarily to the fact that our interest payments in fiscal were lower on our convertible subordinated notes than our interest payments on our convertible subordinated notes  which were repurchased and redeemed in fiscal and no longer outstanding during fiscal see liquidity and capital resources below for further discussion of our convertible subordinated notes 
other income expense  net 
other income expense  net  was a net expense of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
during fiscal  the net expense was primarily due to the write down of certain private and publicly held investments  which totaled million  costs associated with the termination of our interest rate swap liabilities  which totaled million  and a write down of a receivable and escrow account relating to the disposition of the previously acquired icesoft business  which totaled million 
we monitor our investments for impairment by considering current factors  including economic environment  market conditions  operational performance and other specific factors relating to the business underlying the investment 
during fiscal  the net expense was primarily due to the write down of certain private and publicly traded investments of million and a loss on the disposition of the previously acquired icesoft business of million  offset in part by a realized gain of million related to the disposition of the remaining shares of liberate technologies  inc liberate 
as a result of the write downs during fiscal and  we have no remaining investment book value on our balance sheet relating to private companies as of january provision for income taxes despite the occurrence of net losses in fiscal and  we had a tax provision of million and million and an effective tax rate of and in fiscal and  respectively 
in both fiscal and  we recorded a valuation allowance based on management s determination that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets as of january  and will not be realized 
as of january   deferred tax assets of approximately million consisting of certain net operating loss and credit carry forwards resulting from the exercise of employee stock options had not been recognized in the financial statements 
when utilized  the tax benefit of these loss and credit carry forwards will be accounted for as a credit to additional paid in capital 
years ended january  and revenues total revenues were million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease in total revenues of in fiscal was due to a decline in product and service revenues resulting primarily from the current economic downturn in the high technology sector 
this downturn affected us both directly  by decreasing our sales  and indirectly  because our products are incorporated into our customers products  and as our customers sales decline  our royalty revenue declines as well 
product revenues decreased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal our product revenues  excluding run time royalties  decreased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal run time royalties declined to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal product revenues accounted for approximately and of total revenues in fiscal and  respectively 
the decline in product revenues was primarily due to lower customer demand for hardware and software products  including run time royalties  which are generally tied to the number of products deployed  largely as a result of the current economic downturn in the high technology sector 
during fiscal  some of our customers deferred or canceled projects  in whole or in part  and experienced budgeting constraints causing a reduction in their purchases of our products 
service revenues decreased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to lower customer demand for maintenance  consulting and training services primarily as a result of the current economic downturn in the high technology sector 
maintenance revenues decreased from million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal other service revenues declined to million in fiscal from million in fiscal service revenues accounted for approximately and of total revenues in fiscal and  respectively 
revenues from international sales decreased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the overall decrease was due to a decline in revenues from japan and an decrease in revenues from emea 
the decline in revenues in japan resulted primarily from the transition to a direct sales model in japan from a distribution model 
revenues in japan were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decline in emea was primarily a result of local economic slowdowns  which caused lower customer demand for our products and services 
revenues in emea were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this decline was offset by a increase in revenues from asia pacific  which were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal overall  however  international sales were not as adversely affected by the decrease in customer spending as domestic sales 
as a result  international revenues accounted for of total revenues for fiscal compared to in fiscal cost of revenues the overall cost of products and services as a percentage of total revenues was in fiscal compared to in fiscal cost of products was million and million in fiscal and  respectively  reflecting a decrease of from fiscal to fiscal product related cost of revenues as a percentage of product revenues was in fiscal compared to in fiscal the decline in product related costs as a percentage of product revenue in fiscal was primarily due to lower amortization expense relating to capitalized software development costs  and lower third party royalty costs 
amortization of capitalized software development costs and third party royalty costs included in cost of products for fiscal and amounted to million and million  and million and million  respectively 
cost of services was million and million in fiscal and  respectively  a decrease of 
service related cost of revenues as a percentage of service revenues was in fiscal compared to in fiscal the decrease in absolute dollars of service costs in fiscal was primarily due to reduced utilization of outside consultants and a reduction of full time employees as part of the restructuring program implemented during the second quarter of fiscal our consulting costs in fiscal were million compared to million in fiscal the increase in service related costs as a percentage of service revenues in fiscal was due to a greater decline in the service revenues than the decline in fixed costs associated with customer support  personnel and certified third party contractors within our professional services organization 
operating expenses selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses were million and million in fiscal and  respectively  reflecting a decrease of from fiscal to fiscal as a percentage of total revenues  selling and marketing expenses were in fiscal compared to in fiscal the decrease in absolute dollars of selling and marketing expenses was attributable to lower sales commission expenses as a result of decreased sales volume and decreased expenditures in various areas  primarily internal sales events and recognition programs  relating to our restructuring program implemented during the second quarter of fiscal sales commission costs and internal sales events and recognition programs decreased by million and million  respectively  in fiscal compared to fiscal this decrease was offset in part by an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts of million in fiscal  due to an increase in the number of customers filing for bankruptcy in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in these expenses as a percentage of revenues was due to an overall lower revenue base and expenses declining at a lower rate than revenues 
product development and engineering expenses 
product development and engineering expenses were million and million in fiscal and  respectively  reflecting an increase of from fiscal to fiscal as a percentage of total revenues  product development and engineering expenses were in fiscal compared to in fiscal the increase in product development and engineering expenses was primarily due to the increase in staff and associated support for engineers to expand and enhance our product lines and the addition of engineering staff as a result of acquisitions completed in late fiscal and early we added employees to our engineering staff during fiscal as a result of our acquisitions of eonic  bsdi and telenetworks 
the increase in costs as a percentage of revenues in fiscal compared to was primarily due to an overall lower revenue base and expenses declining at a lower rate than revenues 
in addition  we received million and million of funded research and development related to our center of excellence initiative  which offset a portion of our gross research and development expenses in fiscal years and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million and million in fiscal and  respectively  reflecting a decrease of from fiscal to fiscal as a percentage of total revenues  general and administrative expenses were in fiscal compared to in fiscal general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars declined due to our implementation  during the second quarter of fiscal  of cost control measures in various areas  primarily consulting and travel costs 
our consulting and travel costs decreased by million in fiscal as a result of our efforts to reduce costs 
the increase in expenses as a percentage of total revenues in fiscal was primarily a result of revenues declining at a higher rate than general and administrative expenses 
amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles 
amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles totaled million and million in fiscal and  respectively  reflecting a decrease of from fiscal to fiscal the decrease in amortization in fiscal compared to primarily related to the reduced carrying value of goodwill and purchased intangibles as a result of the million impairment charge recorded during fiscal the decrease was offset by additional amortization resulting from acquisitions occurring during fiscal acquisitions made subsequent to june  are accounted for under non amortization methods consistent with sfas no 
 business combinations sfas see recent accounting pronouncements and note  summary of significant accounting policies in notes to consolidated financial statements for an explanation of sfas acquisition related costs reversals 
acquisition related costs or reversals totaled a net reversal of  in fiscal and a net cost of million in fiscal the acquisition related reversal in fiscal related to a net reversal of million of excess acquisition related liabilities from our merger with integrated systems 
we were able to sub lease some properties for longer than we had anticipated and were able to exit other leasehold properties earlier than originally estimated 
acquisition related costs of million in fiscal consisted of million relating to the merger with integrated systems and million of in process research and development charges associated with various purchase transactions completed during fiscal  including amounts related to the acquisitions of embedded support tools of million  rapid logic of million  audesi of million and icesoft of  see note  acquisitions and dispositions in notes to consolidated financial statements 
the integrated systems related acquisition costs of million relate to i million in investment banking fees  ii million in workforce reduction costs  iii million for consolidation of excess facilities  iv million for legal  accounting and other professional fees and v  for general integration costs 
we incurred workforce reduction costs as a result of eliminating duplicate positions following the merger  primarily in the areas of sales management for million  general and administrative staff for million  engineering and services management for million and executive staff for million 
we incurred costs in connection with the consolidation of excess facilities in europe  japan and the united states 
legal  accounting and other professional fees were incurred in connection with the acquisition process for integrated systems and the elimination of acquired legal entities in the united states  emea and japan 
the reorganization of wind river following the acquisition of integrated systems allowed us to structure our company to promote efficiency of operations  resulting in reduced employee costs  the benefit of which was recognized immediately following the merger  and reduced lease costs  the impact of which was more fully realized toward the end of fiscal as facilities were exited 
a summary of the acquisition costs is outlined as follows original charges non cash charges cash payments acquisition accruals at january  cash payments reversals in fiscal year acquisition accruals at january  in thousands investment banking fees   workforce reduction   consolidation of excess facilities    legal  accounting and other professional fees   general integration costs the amounts related to in process technology associated with telenetworks  embedded support tools  audesi  rapid logic and icesoft represent purchased in process technology for projects that have not yet reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future use 
the value of the in process research and development was determined by estimating the net cash flows resulting from the completion of the projects reduced by the percentage of completion of the projects 
net cash flows were tax effected using estimated income taxes consistent with our anticipated tax rate for the foreseeable future and then discounted back to their present value at a discount rate based on our required risk adjusted  weighted average rate of return 
our estimated revenues  margins and operating costs are based upon historical information about similar product development cycles combined with projections of future revenue and cost patterns  including projections used when initially evaluating the acquisition of telenetworks  rapid logic  embedded support tools  icesoft and audesi 
there is no assurance that we will realize revenues from these in process projects in the amounts estimated or that the costs incurred will be materially consistent with estimates made 
the nature of the efforts to develop purchased in process technology into commercially viable products principally relates to the completion of all planning  designing  prototyping  verification and testing activities that are necessary to establish that the resulting products can meet their design specifications  including function  features and technical performance requirements 
due to the fact that the projects were in process  there is uncertainty regarding whether they can be successfully finished and result in the net cash flows that were originally estimated at the time of the acquisitions 
it is reasonably possible that the development of the acquired technology could fail because of either prohibitive costs  our inability to perform the required completion efforts or other factors outside our control  such as a change in the market for the resulting developed products 
if the development of the technology is unsuccessful  the technology may be abandoned during the development phase 
should our development efforts fail or encounter significant delay  then our future returns may be significantly reduced 
in such case  we may be unable to recover our investment in this project  may be less well positioned to benefit from new product markets in these areas and our future operating results could be adversely affected 
with the exception of the business restructuring and impairment review discussed below  the assumptions used in determining the value of in process research and development acquired in connection with our purchase acquisitions completed during fiscal and fiscal have been consistent  in all material respects  with the actual results through january  the assumptions primarily consist of the expected completion date for the in process projects  estimated costs to complete the projects  and revenue and expense projections once the products have entered the market 
failure to achieve the expected levels of revenues and net income from these products during their entire life cycle will negatively impact the return on investment expected at the time that the acquisitions were completed and could potentially result in impairment of any other assets related to the development activities 
see years ended january  and operating expenses impairment of goodwill and purchased intangibles for further discussion of our impairment review 
impairment of goodwill and purchased intangibles 
during the second and fourth quarters of fiscal  we identified indicators of possible impairment of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets relating to acquisitions made in earlier years 
as a result  during fiscal  we recorded an aggregate charge of million  of which million related to the impairment of goodwill and million related to the impairment of purchased intangible assets 
see years ended january  and operating expenses impairment of goodwill and purchased intangibles for further information about the impairment review conducted in fiscal there was no impairment of goodwill and purchased intangibles in fiscal restructuring and other costs 
as a result of the decision to restructure our business  we recorded net restructuring costs of million during fiscal  which were classified as operating expenses 
see above years ended january  and operating expenses restructuring and other costs for further details on the restructuring costs for fiscal there were no restructuring and other costs in fiscal other income expense interest income 
interest income declined to million in fiscal from million in fiscal reflecting a decrease of from fiscal to fiscal the decrease in interest income was primarily due to lower invested balances  lower interest rates on invested balances and a lower average base of invested balances throughout the year 
total cash and cash equivalents  investments and restricted cash at the end of fiscal and were approximately million and million  respectively 
interest expense 
interest expense was million and million in fiscal and  respectively  a decrease of 
the decrease was primarily due to the repurchase and redemption of the outstanding principal balance of the convertible subordinated notes during fiscal this decrease in interest expense was partially offset by additional interest expense incurred on our convertible subordinated notes issued in december see liquidity and capital resources below for further discussion of our convertible subordinated notes 
other income expense  net 
other income expense  net  was net expense of million and net income of million in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in net expense in fiscal was primarily due to the write down of certain private and publicly traded investments of million and a loss on the disposition of the previously acquired icesoft business of million  offset in part by a realized gain of million related to the disposition of the remaining shares of liberate 
during fiscal  we realized gains of million related to the disposition of shares of liberate and e sim  inc e sim 
provision for income taxes despite the occurrence of net losses in fiscal and  we had a tax provision of million and million and an effective tax rate of and in fiscal and  respectively  due to significant costs associated with in process research and development and amortization and impairment of goodwill  which are not deductible for income tax purposes 
in addition  in fiscal  we recorded a valuation allowance based on management s determination that it was more likely than not that our deferred tax assets as of january  would not be realized 
excluding these charges  the effective tax rate would have been in each fiscal year 
as of january   approximately million of the gross deferred tax asset related to certain us operating loss carry forwards resulting from the exercise of employee stock options 
when recognized  the tax benefit related to these assets will be accounted for as a credit to additional paid in capital rather than a reduction of the income tax provision 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows as of january   we had working capital of approximately million  and cash  cash equivalents and investments of approximately million  which includes million of cash and cash equivalents  million of short term investments and million of investments with maturities of greater than one year  but excludes restricted cash of million associated with our synthetic leases 
we invest primarily in highly liquid  investment grade instruments 
we have substantial debt service  principal repayment and operating lease payment obligations  which could affect our liquidity  cash reserves and ability to obtain additional financing if we need to do so 
operating activities primarily include the net loss for the periods under consideration  non cash charges such as depreciation and amortization expense and changes in assets and liabilities 
in fiscal  our operating activities used net cash of million compared to net cash provided of million in fiscal and million in fiscal net cash used in operating activities for fiscal consisted of cash used by operations of million offset by an increase in cash of million arising from changes in assets and liabilities  primarily accounts receivable 
accounts receivable decreased by million due primarily to the lower sales volume and to an increased rate of collections 
net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal consisted of a decrease in cash generated from operations of million offset by an increase in cash of million arising from changes in assets and liabilities  primarily accounts receivable 
accounts receivable decreased by million due to the lower sales volume in fiscal compared to fiscal and due to an increased rate of collections

cash from operations includes net loss of million  million and million offset primarily by depreciation and amortization of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  and impairment of goodwill and purchased intangibles of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
our operating cash flows depend heavily on the level of our sales  which in turn depend  to a large extent on general economic conditions affecting us and our customers  as well as the timing of new product introductions and other competitive factors and our ability to control expenses successfully 
in fiscal  our investing activities used net cash of million  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal investing activities generally relate to the purchase of investments  business acquisitions and equipment purchases  partially offset by cash provided from the sale and maturity of investments 
purchases of investments totaled million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
purchases of capital equipment totaled million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
additionally  during fiscal and  we used million and million  respectively  for acquisition related activities

the sales and maturities of investments in fiscal were million 
in fiscal  our financing activities used net cash of million and provided net cash of million in fiscal and million in fiscal during fiscal  the primary source of cash from financing activities was million received from the issuance of common stock from employee stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan activity  offset by million used for the repurchase of common stock and million in repayment of a line of credit at our japanese subsidiary 
in june  the board of directors approved a program to repurchase up to million of our common stock over a two year period  primarily to manage future dilution from employee incentive plans including option and employee stock purchase plans  as well as potential dilution relating to our convertible bond 
during fiscal  we repurchased  shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of million 
during fiscal  the primary source of cash was million from the offering of our convertible notes  as discussed below  along with proceeds of million received from the issuance of common stock from employee stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan purchases 
cash provided by these sources was partially offset by cash of million used to repurchase or redeem the outstanding convertible notes as discussed below 
during fiscal  cash provided by the issuance of common stock from stock option exercises and the increase in a line of credit at our japanese subsidiary were partially offset by the repayment of bank borrowings associated with acquired companies 
convertible subordinated notes during fiscal  we repurchased and retired million in face value of our convertible subordinated notes 
in january  we redeemed the remaining million of the convertible subordinated notes at a redemption price of of the principal 
the net impact of gains and losses on the repurchase  retirement and redemption of the convertible subordinated notes was a gain of  net of taxes  which was reflected in other income expense  net for fiscal in december  we issued million of convertible subordinated notes due december the notes are unsecured  subordinated to all existing and future senior debt and convertible into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion price of per share 
the notes mature on december   unless earlier redeemed or converted 
interest is payable in cash semi annually in arrears on june and december of each year  commencing june  at the option of the holder  the notes may be converted into our common stock at any time at the then current conversion price 
we may redeem all or a portion of the notes for cash at a redemption price of of the principal amount between december  and december   and of the principal amount beginning december  and thereafter 
additionally  under specified circumstances we may redeem the notes prior to the indenture under which the notes were issued provides that an event of default will occur if i we fail to pay principal or premium on the notes  ii we fail to pay interest on the notes and fail to cure such non payment within days  iii we fail to perform any other covenant required of us in the indenture and the failure is not cured or waived within days  or iv we or one of our significant subsidiaries fails to pay  at final maturity or upon acceleration  any indebtedness for money borrowed in an outstanding principal amount in excess of million  including lease commitments  and the indebtedness is not discharged  or the default is not cured  waived or rescinded within days after written notice is provided in accordance with the terms of the indenture 
if any of these events of default occurs  either the trustee or the holders of at least of the outstanding notes may declare the principal amount of the notes to be due and payable 
in addition  an event of bankruptcy  insolvency or reorganization involving us or any of our significant subsidiaries will constitute an event of default under the indenture and  in that case  the principal amount of the notes will automatically become due and payable 
commitments in september and november  we entered into two operating leases for our headquarters facility constructed on land owned by us in alameda  california 
after consideration of various financing alternatives for the construction of our headquarters buildings on land owned by us  the related economic impact of each alternative and the ability to retain control of the property  we chose a form of financing that we believed offered beneficial economic terms  commonly referred to as a synthetic lease 
these leases were treated as operating leases for accounting purposes and financing leases for tax purposes 
a synthetic lease is a form of off balance sheet financing under which an unrelated third party funds of the costs for the acquisition and or construction of the property and leases the asset back to the company  as lessee 
none of our officers or employees had any financial interest in these synthetic lease arrangements 
the operating leases provided us with the option  at the end of their terms  to either acquire the buildings at the lessor s original cost or arrange for the buildings to be acquired 
under the terms of the leases  we were required to maintain compliance with certain financial covenants relating to minimum ebitda  minimum tangible net worth and minimum net unencumbered cash 
as of january   we were not in compliance with the ebitda covenant  which required that we maintain a certain ebitda level 
the lessor waived the ebitda covenant as of january  conditioned upon our exercise of the purchase options under the leases prior to april  in january  we notified the lessor of our intent to exercise the purchase options under the leases and  in april  we completed the transactions  terminated the synthetic leases and purchased the buildings for a purchase price of million 
as a result of our completion of the purchase options  we will reflect the buildings as an asset on our balance sheet in the first quarter of fiscal additionally  our restricted cash of million held under the leases was released 
prior to the exercise of the purchase options  we reflected lease payments as a rental expense in our statement of operations 
having acquired the buildings  we will no longer record a lease expense for the buildings and  commencing in the first quarter of fiscal  we will record depreciation expense for the buildings over their estimated useful lives of years 
in connection with the termination of the synthetic leases  in april  we entered into a loan facility for an aggregate principal amount of million  consisting of a million term loan and million term loan  both of which mature in april we have borrowed million of the facility at an interest a rate equal to the london interbank offering rate  or libor  plus 
under the terms of the facility  we are holding million in marketable securities as restricted cash to secure performance of our obligations under the facility 
in march and january  we entered into interest rate swap agreements to mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates on our floating rate operating lease 
in november  we terminated both of these interest rate swap agreements 
as a result  during fiscal  we recorded a cash charge of million relating to the liability for such interest rate swap agreements and reduced restricted cash by million  the amount previously held in restricted cash as collateral for the interest rate swap agreements 
as of january   our future financial commitments  including interest payments on our convertible notes but excluding the term loans discussed above  are as set forth in the table below year ended january  thereafter total in thousands synthetic lease payments  subordinated convertible debt    other operating leases      total       reflects the exercise of the purchase option for the synthetic leases discussed above  including the payment of the aggregate purchase price of million 
the million convertible subordinated notes mature in december  but may be redeemed by us starting in or earlier if certain conditions are met 
see convertible subordinated notes above 
minimum future sublease income to be received under noncancelable subleases is approximately million 
as part of our restructuring reserve  we have accrued approximately million relating to future payments associated with leases for excess facilities 
we had no material planned capital commitments as of january  our capital requirements depend on numerous factors including selling and marketing expenses  product development and engineering expenses  general and administrative expenses and working capital to support business growth 
we anticipate that our operating and capital expenditures will constitute a material use of our cash resources 
as a result  our net cash flows will depend heavily on i the level of our future sales which depend  to a large extent  on general economic conditions affecting us and our customers  as well as the timing of new product introductions and other competitive factors and ii our ability to implement our restructuring plans and to control expenses 
although it is difficult for us to predict future liquidity requirements with certainty  we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents will satisfy our cash requirements for working capital  product development and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months and on a longer term basis 
during or after this period  if cash generated by operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may need to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain an additional credit facility 
our ability to obtain additional financing may be limited by the amount of indebtedness we have outstanding and or our recent performance and financial condition  particularly if our bond rating is lowered or withdrawn  as well as general market conditions if the current economic downturn were to continue or become more serious 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us or  if available  that such financing will be available on favorable terms 
if we were unable to obtain financing  we might be required to reduce our expenses  including product development and engineering expenses  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations

factors that may affect future results our business faces significant risks 
the risks described below may not be the only risks we face 
additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently think are immaterial may also impair our business operations 
if any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations could suffer  and the trading price of our common stock could decline 
the economic downturn has adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact our revenues and earnings 
in addition  uncertainties associated with the downturn increase the difficulty of financial planning and forecasting 
we are currently in the midst of a general economic downturn that commenced in in the united states and expanded to many other regions of the world during the economic downturn has been especially pronounced in the high technology sector generally and the telecommunications sector in particular 
beginning in fiscal year and continuing through fiscal year  we have experienced a decline in revenues and a loss of profitability  which we believe is attributable  at least in part  to these downturns  as many of our customers experienced budgeting constraints  causing them to defer or cancel projects 
our total revenues decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal and decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal our net loss was million  or a net loss of per share  for fiscal compared to a net loss of million  or a net loss of per share  for fiscal and a net loss of million  or a net loss of per share  for fiscal our decline in revenues during fiscal years and  as well as the continuing adverse economic conditions  led us to implement restructuring programs in both fiscal and that included headcount reductions and other cost control measures  and to record charges for restructuring and impairment of acquired goodwill and other intangible assets during fiscal years and we cannot predict how long or severe this downturn will be or whether any actions taken or proposed by the united states government will be effective to bolster the economy 
as a result of this uncertainty  forecasting and financial and strategic planning are more difficult than usual 
if the downturn continues for longer than we expect or becomes more severe  our business will continue to suffer and we may experience additional declines in sales  as well as continued losses  as our customers further reduce their spending 
in addition  the adverse impact of the downturn on the capital markets could impair our ability to raise capital as needed and impede our ability to expand our business 
we have recently introduced a new business model  including a new type of licensing arrangement  and cannot be sure that the new model will be successful 
additionally  we expect the transition to the new model will impact the timing of our reported revenues 
in november  we introduced our enterprise license model  which includes technology integrated into market specific platforms and subscription based licenses 
while we believe that the introduction of the enterprise license model will have significant benefits for our customers  it is possible these benefits may not materialize 
there is a risk that customers may not accept the new products we offered under our enterprise license model  or that they may reject the terms of the model itself 
there is a risk that customers may delay or defer product ordering decisions  and that we may not be able to engage our customers at appropriate levels of management to make enterprise wide subscription orders feasible 
there is a further risk that we may remain dependent upon large end of quarter transactions  that our selling efforts in coming quarters could be disrupted  and that the transition to the enterprise license model could cause us to incur unanticipated administrative and other costs 
in any such event  our revenue and earnings for a quarter could be below our expectations 
although enterprise licenses represent a potential source of renewable license revenue  there is also a risk that customers will not renew their licenses at the end of the term 
in addition  there is a risk that customers who purchase enterprise licenses may spend less in the aggregate over the term of the enterprise license than if they had been required to purchase perpetual licenses under our traditional project based model 
also  because the enterprise license includes limited services  customers may purchase fewer stand alone services from us  which could negatively impact our services revenues 
we expect many of our strategic and major customers to adopt our enterprise license model for their current needs  and that they may also transition existing perpetual development seats to enterprise license model terms 
during the transition of our business model from project based licensing to the enterprise license model  we expect the timing of our reported revenue to be impacted because under the enterprise license model revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription period 
by contrast  our traditional project based license requires a majority of license revenue to be recognized in the quarter in which the products are delivered and a much smaller amount relating to the fair value of the maintenance being deferred and recognized subsequently over the maintenance period 
therefore  an order for a subscription license will result in lower current quarter revenue than an equal sized order for a project based license 
as a result  the impact on near term and deferred revenue will depend on the rate at which customers transition from our project based model to our enterprise license model 
to the extent that the adoption rate is higher than we expect  we may experience a greater decline in near term revenue  as well as an increase in deferred revenue 
our restructuring plans may not enable us to achieve profitability in a difficult economic environment or achieve our business objectives 
in response to market conditions and the decline in our revenues  in both fiscal and  we implemented restructuring plans that were designed to align our anticipated revenues more closely with our cost structure 
our restructuring plans have been based on certain assumptions regarding the cost structure of our business and the nature and severity of the current industry adjustment and general economic trends 
we cannot be certain that the assumptions underlying the restructuring plans will prove to be accurate 
if they are not  our restructuring plans may not result in the correct alignment of our anticipated revenues and cost structure 
our restructuring plans involved the implementation of a number of initiatives  including headcount reductions  facilities closures  and other cost control measures such as employing a program of office closure days and reducing discretional spending on items such as consulting and travel 
as a result of the headcount reductions  we eliminated an aggregate of  employee positions in fiscal and  which represented approximately one half of our employee base as of the beginning of fiscal we also recorded restructuring charges of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
these measures may adversely affect our ability to realize our current or future business objectives 
specifically  because our headcount reductions have been so significant  they may cause a disruption to our sales operations 
if that were to occur  our revenues might be adversely impacted following the restructuring 
in addition  the costs actually incurred in connection with restructuring actions may exceed our estimated costs of these actions 
we may need to refine  expand or extend our plans  which may involve additional restructuring actions  such as further headcount reductions  assessing whether we should consider disposing of businesses or product lines and reviewing the recoverability of remaining tangible and intangible assets 
any decision to further limit investment or to dispose of or otherwise exit additional businesses may result in the recording of additional accrued liabilities for one time or other charges  such as work force reduction costs  asset write downs and contractual settlements 
current and additional restructuring actions may result in further cash and or non cash charges  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
as a result  we cannot be sure that we will return to profitability as a result of our restructuring plans 
numerous factors may cause our total revenues and operating results to fluctuate significantly from period to period 
these fluctuations increase the difficulty of financial planning and forecasting and may result in decreases in our available cash and declines in the market price of our stock 
a number of factors  many of which are outside our control  may cause or contribute to significant fluctuations in our total revenues and operating results 
these fluctuations make financial planning and forecasting more difficult 
in addition  these fluctuations may result in unanticipated decreases in our available cash  which could negatively impact our operations 
as discussed more fully below  these fluctuations also could increase the volatility of our stock price 
factors that may cause or contribute to fluctuations in our operating results and revenues include our implementation of our enterprise license model and use of subscription based licenses  as discussed above  the number and timing of orders we receive  including disproportionately higher receipt and shipment of orders in the last month of the quarter  changes in the length of our products sales cycles  which increase as our customers purchase decisions become more strategic and are made at higher management levels  reductions in the number of engineering projects started by our customers due to their own difficult financial or economic conditions  the success of our customers products from which we derive our royalty revenue  the mix of our revenues as between sales of products and lower margin sales of services  our ability to control our operating expenses  and fully realize the impact of the restructuring plans we have implemented  our ability to continue to develop  introduce and ship competitive new products and product enhancements quickly  possible deferrals of orders by customers in anticipation of new product introductions  announcements  product introductions and price reductions by our competitors  our ability to manage costs for fixed price consulting agreements  seasonal product purchases by our customers  which historically have been higher in our fourth fiscal quarter  changes in business cycles that affect the markets in which we sell our products  economic conditions in the united states and international markets  and foreign currency exchange rates 
one or more of the foregoing factors may cause our operating expenses to be disproportionately high or may cause our net revenue and operating results to fluctuate significantly 
results from prior periods are thus not necessarily indicative of the results of future periods 
we have substantial commitments  which could make it difficult for us to obtain financing and deplete our cash reserves 
additionally  these commitments could be accelerated in certain circumstances  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
as of january   we had million in outstanding indebtedness under our convertible subordinated notes and million in long term obligations under the lease financings of our facilities in alameda  california 
as of january   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  short term investments of million  investments with maturities of greater than one year of million and restricted cash of million 
the indenture under which our convertible subordinated notes were issued provides that an event of default occurs if we or one of our significant subsidiaries fails to pay  at final maturity or upon acceleration  any indebtedness for money borrowed in an outstanding principal amount in excess of million  including lease commitments  and the indebtedness is not discharged  or the default is not cured  waived or rescinded within days after written notice is provided in accordance with the terms of the indenture 
we terminated our synthetic leases and completed the purchase of our alameda headquarters in april in connection with the purchase of the buildings  we paid to the lessor an aggregate purchase price of million and released a total of million from restricted cash  which amount had been held as collateral relating to the operating leases 
however  in april  we entered into a loan facility for a total of million  of which we have drawn million 
under the terms of the facility  we are holding million in marketable securities as restricted cash to secure our obligations thereunder 
see liquidity and capital resources commitments 
we face intense competition in the embedded software industry  which could decrease demand for our products or cause us to reduce our prices 
the embedded software industry is characterized by rapid change  new and complex technology and intense competition 
our ability to maintain our current market share depends upon our ability to satisfy customer requirements  enhance existing products and develop and introduce new products 
due to the complexity of the markets in which we operate  where our customers often develop embedded systems in house  it is difficult to assess the impact of competition on our business and our related share of the markets that we operate in 
we have faced increasing competition in recent years as customers have decreased research and development budgets  sought to increase the value they receive from vendors  including us  attempted to leverage a more competitive bidding process when spending research and development budgets and or deferred or canceled projects  in whole or in part 
as a result  we believe that some customers have elected not to purchase our products and have chosen to undertake such development in house  selected solutions they perceive to be less expensive or relied upon existing licenses from us rather than making new purchases 
we expect the intensity of competition to increase in the future 
increased competitiveness may result in reductions in the prices of our products  run time royalties and services  lower than expected gross margins or loss of market share  any of which would harm our business 
our primary competition comes from internal research and development departments of companies that develop embedded systems in house 
in many cases  companies that develop embedded systems in house have already made significant investments of time and effort in developing their own internal systems  making acceptance of our products as a replacement more difficult 
additionally  many of these in house departments may increasingly choose to use open source software  such as the linux operating system 
we also compete with independent software vendors and  to a limited extent  with open source vendors 
some of the companies that develop embedded systems in house and some of these independent software vendors  such as microsoft corporation  may have significantly greater financial  technical  marketing  sales and other resources and significantly greater name recognition than we do 
demands for rapid change and the increasing complexity of the technology in our industry intensify the competition we face 
in addition  our competitors may consolidate or establish strategic alliances to expand product offerings and resources or address new market segments 
as a result  they may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or to devote greater resources to the development  promotion  sale and support of their products 
these factors favor larger competitors that have the resources to develop new technologies or to respond more quickly with new product offerings or product enhancements 
we may be unable to meet the pace of rapid development set by our competitors or may incur additional costs attempting to do so  which may cause declines in our operating results 
our competitors may foresee the course of market developments more accurately than we do and could in the future develop new technologies that compete with our products or even render our products obsolete  any of which could adversely affect our competitive position 
if we do not continue to address new and rapidly changing markets and increasingly complex technologies successfully and deliver our products on a timely basis  our revenues and operating results will decline 
the market for embedded software is characterized by ongoing technological developments  evolving industry standards and rapid changes in customer requirements and product offerings in the embedded market 
our success depends upon our ability to adapt and respond to these changes in a timely and cost effective manner 
if we fail to continually update our existing products to keep them current with customer needs or to develop new or enhanced products to take advantage of new technologies  emerging standards and expanding customer requirements  our existing products could become obsolete and our financial performance would suffer 
we have from time to time experienced delays in the commercial release of new technologies  new products and enhancements of existing products 
these delays are commonplace in the software industry due to the complexity and unpredictability of the development work required 
we must effectively market and sell new product offerings to key customers  because once a customer has designed a product with a particular operating system  that customer typically is reluctant to change its supplier due to the significant related costs 
if we cannot adapt or respond in a cost effective and timely manner to new technologies and new customer requirements  sales of our products could decline 
the costs of software development can be high  and we may not realize revenues from our development efforts for a substantial period of time 
introducing new products that rapidly address changing market demands requires a continued high level of investment in research and development 
our product development and engineering expenses were million  or of total revenues  for the fiscal year ended january  compared to million  or of total revenues  for the fiscal year ended january  as we undertake extensive capital outlays to address changes in the embedded market  we may be unable to realize revenue as soon as we may expect 
the costs associated with software development are increasing  including the costs of acquiring or licensing new technologies 
our investment in new and existing market opportunities prior to our ability to generate revenue from these new opportunities may adversely affect our operating results 
because a significant portion of our revenue is derived from royalties  we are dependent upon the ability of our customers to develop and penetrate new markets successfully and to pay royalties 
our operating systems and middleware products are embedded in end user products developed and marketed by our customers  and we receive royalty fees for each copy of our operating system and middleware products embedded in those products 
therefore  our royalty revenues depend both upon our ability to successfully negotiate royalty agreements with our customers and  in turn  upon our customers successful commercialization of their underlying products 
in particular  we derive significant revenue from customers that develop products in highly competitive and technologically complex markets such as the internet infrastructure  servers and storage  digital consumer  aerospace and defense  industrial control and automotive markets 
if these customers sell fewer products or otherwise face significant economic difficulties  our revenues will decline 
for example  during fiscal  our revenues from run time royalties declined as compared to fiscal  which we believe is primarily due to our customers response to the current market conditions in the high technology sector 
we cannot control our customers product development or commercialization or predict their success 
in addition  we depend on our customers to accurately report the use of their products in order for us to collect our run time royalties 
if our customers are not successful with their products or do not accurately report use of their products to us  our royalty revenues may decline significantly 
additionally  because linux is royalty free  we may be forced to reduce the prices of our run time royalties  which may cause our revenues and profit margins to decline 
our significant international business activities subject us to increased costs and economic risks 
we develop and sell a substantial percentage of our products internationally 
for fiscal  revenues from international sales were million  or of total revenue  as compared to million  or of total revenue for fiscal additionally  we have investments in  or have made acquisitions of  companies located outside the united states 
over the long term  we expect to continue to make investments to further support and expand our international operations and increase our direct sales force and distribution network in emea and asia 
risks inherent in international operations include the imposition of governmental controls and regulatory requirements  the costs and risks of localizing products for foreign countries  differences in business cultures and sales cycles  differences in operation and sales support expenses  unexpected changes in tariffs  import and export restrictions and other barriers and restrictions  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  restrictions on repatriation of earnings  exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates  the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign subsidiaries and branch operations  the costs and risks of operating in countries experiencing geopolitical conflict and or terrorism  the effect of our adoption of global pricing models  difficulties in integrating products and operations from foreign acquisitions  exposure to local economic slowdowns  and the need to guarantee credit instruments extended to support foreign operations 
any of these events  regionally and as a whole  could reduce our international sales and increase our costs of doing business internationally and have a material adverse effect on our gross margins and net operating results 
the costs associated with acquisitions and investments could disrupt our business and harm our operating results 
we anticipate that  as part of our business strategy  we will continue to evaluate acquisition and investment opportunities in businesses  products and technologies that complement ours 
these investments and acquisitions can be expensive and often require us to dedicate significant time and resources to the process 
we have incurred significant costs in connection with acquisition transactions in recent fiscal years and may incur significant costs in connection with future transactions  whether or not they are consummated 
acquisitions involve additional risks including  among others  difficulties in integrating the operations  technologies  and products of the acquired companies  diverting management s attention from normal daily operations of the business  and potential difficulties in completing projects associated with in process research and development 
if we cannot successfully manage the integration of businesses we may acquire or are unable to realize the benefits of  or anticipated revenues from  any acquisitions  our business  financial condition and operating results could suffer 
if revenues associated with acquired businesses do not meet our original expectations  acquisitions may result in charges relating to impairment of acquired goodwill and purchased intangibles 
during both fiscal and  we identified indicators of possible impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets relating to acquisitions made in earlier years 
as a result of these impairment reviews  in fiscal we recorded an aggregate charge of million for the impairment of goodwill and purchased intangibles relating to our acquisitions of embedded support tools corporation  audesi technologies inc  rapid logic  inc  icesoft as and software development systems  inc  and in fiscal we recorded an aggregate charge of million for the impairment of purchased intangibles relating to our acquisitions of eonic nv and the telenetworks division from next level communications  inc similarly  we cannot guarantee that our investments will yield a significant return  if any 
for example  we recorded aggregate impairment charges on public and private investments of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
failure of our current and planned information systems  controls and infrastructure to adequately manage and support our anticipated growth and global operations could disrupt our business 
we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience in the long term  both through acquisitions and internal expansion  significant growth in our headcount and in the scope  complexity and geographic reach of our operations 
to support this expansion  we must standardize  integrate and improve our management controls  reporting systems and procedures and information technology infrastructure 
to implement those improvements  we must purchase  develop and maintain complex and expensive information management systems 
our current and planned systems  procedures and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations 
failure of these systems to meet our needs and an inability to efficiently integrate and expand support worldwide could disrupt our operations 
our ability to manage this growth is complicated by the need to implement headcount reductions and cost control measures in the short term in response to general economic conditions and declining revenues 
see our restructuring plans may not enable us to achieve profitability in a difficult economic environment or achieve our business objectives above 
our common stock price is subject to volatility 
in recent years  the stock markets in general and the shares of technology companies in particular have experienced extreme price fluctuations 
these recent price fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the companies affected 
our stock price has similarly experienced significant volatility 
as reported on the nasdaq national market  during fiscal our stock had a high sales price of and a low sales price of and  during fiscal  our stock had a high sales price of and a low sales price of 
the last sale price of our common stock as reported on the nasdaq national market on april  was 
in recent fiscal quarters  we have experienced shortfalls in revenue and earnings from levels expected by securities analysts and investors  which have had an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock 
these factors relating to the fluctuations in our revenues and operating results may continue to affect our stock price 
comments by or changes in estimates from securities analysts as well as significant developments involving our competitors or our industry could also affect our stock price 
in addition  the market price of our common stock is affected by the stock performance of other technology companies generally  as well as companies in our industry and our customers in particular 
other broad market and industry factors may negatively affect our operating results or cause our stock price to decline  as may general political or economic conditions in the united states and globally  such as recessions  or interest rate or currency fluctuations 
in particular  the stock market may be adversely impacted  or experience unusual volatility  as a result of the outbreak of armed conflict or hostilities involving the united states or incidences of terrorism in  or directed at  the united states or its allies 
the rights we rely upon to protect the intellectual property underlying our products may not be adequate  which could enable third parties to use our technology and reduce our ability to compete 
our success depends significantly upon the proprietary technology contained in our products 
we currently rely on a combination of patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secret laws  and contractual provisions to establish and protect our intellectual property rights in our technology and products 
we cannot be certain that the steps we take to protect our intellectual property will adequately protect our rights  that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology  or that we can maintain our technology as trade secrets 
in addition  discovery and investigation of unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult 
we expect software piracy  which is difficult to detect  to be a persistent problem  particularly in those foreign countries where the laws may not protect our intellectual property as fully as in the united states 
employees  consultants  and others who participate in the development of our products may breach their agreements with us regarding our intellectual property 
we might not have adequate remedies for infringement or breach of our proprietary rights by third parties  employees or consultants 
further  we have in the past initiated  and in the future may initiate  claims or litigation against third parties for infringement or breach of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights 
whether or not such litigation is determined in our favor  such actions could result in significant expense to us  divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel from productive tasks or cause product shipment delays 
patent  trademark or copyright infringement or product liability claims against us may result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays or require us to expend significant resources 
in addition  patent or copyright claims may require us to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements 
we occasionally receive communications from third parties alleging patent  trademark or copyright infringement or other intellectual property claims  and there is always the chance that third parties may assert infringement claims against us or against our customers under circumstances that might require us to provide indemnification 
additionally  because our products are increasingly used in applications  such as network infrastructure  transportation  medical and mission critical business systems  in which the failure of the embedded system could cause property damage  personal injury or economic loss  we may face product liability claims 
although our agreements with our customers typically contain provisions intended to limit our exposure to infringement and liability claims  these provisions may not be effective in doing so in all circumstances or in all jurisdictions 
any of these types of claims  with or without merit  could result in claims for indemnification by us or costly litigation  could require us to expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology or remedy product defects  cause product shipment delays or require us to pay significant damages if the claims are successful 
in the case of infringement of another party s intellectual property  we may be required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements  however  we cannot be certain that the necessary licenses will be available or that they can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms 
if we are not successful in defending these claims or  with respect to infringement claims  were to fail to obtain royalty or licensing agreements in a timely manner and on reasonable terms  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our investment portfolio and debt obligations 
we place our investments with high quality credit issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
as stated in our policy  our first priority is to reduce the risk of principal loss 
consequently  we seek to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in only high quality credit securities that we believe to be low risk and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
we believe an immediate basis point move in interest rates affecting our floating and fixed rate financial instruments as of january  would have an immaterial effect on our pretax earnings 
we also believe an immediate basis point move in interest rates would have an immaterial effect on the fair value of our fixed income securities 
foreign currency risk we may enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage foreign currency exposures related to certain foreign currency denominated inter company balances 
additionally  we may adjust our foreign currency hedging position by taking out additional contracts or by terminating or offsetting existing forward contracts 
these adjustments may result from changes in the underlying foreign currency exposures or from fundamental shifts in the economics of particular exchange rates 
gains and losses on terminated forward contracts  or on contracts that are offset  are recognized in other income expense in the period of contract termination or offset 
our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to currency fluctuations will depend on the currency exchange rates and other factors in effect as the contracts mature 
as of january   we had outstanding contracts with the following terms buy sell sell sell sell currency gbp euro jpy amount million million million rate usd equivalent    maturity date contract amounts are representative of the expected amounts to be paid under the terms of these instruments 
as of january  the fair value of the above contracts was not significant 
equity price risk we own  shares of common stock of e sim ltd 
e sim that was purchased prior to e sim s public offering in july at per share 
on january   the closing price of e sim s stock was per share 
we own  shares of common stock of tvia  inc tvia that was purchased prior to tvia s public offering in august at per share 
on january   the closing price of tvia s stock was per share 
we own  shares of common stock of insignia solutions  ltd 
insignia purchased in february at a cost of per share 
on january   the closing price of insignia was per share 
we value our publicly held investments using the closing price of the stock at the end of each month 
as a result  we reflect these investments on our balance sheet as of january  at their aggregate market value of approximately  we recorded an impairment charge on these publicly held investments of  and million in fiscal and  respectively 
in each case  the impairment charge represented the amount of other than temporary decline as of the date of impairment 
we also have certain other minority investments in private companies 
these investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and might never develop 
we recorded impairment losses of million and million during fiscal and  respectively  relating to these investments 
as a result of these write downs  we have no remaining investment book value on our balance sheet relating to private companies as of january  these investments had previously been included as a component of other long term assets on our balance sheet and were carried at cost
