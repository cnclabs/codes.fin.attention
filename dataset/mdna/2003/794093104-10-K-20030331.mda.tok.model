item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
our consolidated financial statements are not directly comparable from period to period because of our acquisition and disposition of radio stations and our acquisition of other media businesses 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
historically  our principal sources of revenue have been the sale of block program time  both to national and local program producers  the sale of advertising time on our radio stations  both to national and local advertisers  and the sale of advertising time on our national radio network 
in  we expanded our sources of revenue and product offerings with the acquisition of other media businesses  including publishing and internet businesses 
the following table shows gross broadcasting revenue  the percentage of gross broadcasting revenue for each broadcasting revenue source and net broadcasting revenue 
year ended december  dollars in thousands block program time national local advertising national local infomercials salem radio network other gross broadcasting revenue less agency commissions net broadcasting revenue our broadcasting revenue is affected primarily by the program rates our radio stations charge and by the advertising rates our radio stations and network charge 
the rates for block program time are based upon our stations ability to attract audiences that will support the program producers through contributions and purchases of their products 
advertising rates are based upon the demand for advertising time  which in turn is based on our stations and network s ability to produce results for its advertisers 
historically we have not subscribed to traditional audience measuring services 
instead  we have marketed ourselves to advertisers based upon the responsiveness of our audience 
in selected markets we subscribe to arbitron  which develops quarterly reports to measure a radio station s audience share in the demographic groups targeted by advertisers 
see business radio stations 
each of our radio stations and our network have a general pre determined level of time that they make available for block programs and or advertising  which may vary at different times of the day 
in recent years  we have begun to place greater emphasis on the development of local advertising in all of our markets 
we encourage our general managers and sales managers to increase advertising revenue 
we can create additional advertising revenue in a variety of ways  such as removing block programming that generates marginal audience response  adjusting the start time of programs to add advertising in more desirable time slots and increasing advertising rates 
as is typical in the radio broadcasting industry  our second and fourth quarter advertising revenue generally exceeds our first and third quarter advertising revenue 
quarterly revenue from the sale of block program time does not tend to vary significantly  however  since program rates are generally set annually 
our cash flow is affected by a transition period experienced by radio stations when  due to the nature of the radio station  our plans for the market and other circumstances  we find it beneficial or advisable to change its format 
this transition period occurs when we develop a radio station s customer and listener base 
during this period  a station will typically generate negative or insignificant cash flow 
in the broadcasting industry  radio stations often utilize trade or barter agreements to exchange advertising time for goods or services such as other media advertising  travel or lodging  in lieu of cash 
in order to preserve the sale of our advertising time for cash  we generally enter into trade agreements only if the goods or services bartered to us will be used in our business 
we have minimized our use of trade agreements and have generally sold most of our advertising time for cash 
in  we sold of our advertising time for cash 
in addition  it is our general policy not to preempt advertising paid for in cash with advertising paid for in trade 
the primary operating expenses incurred in the ownership and operation of our radio stations include employee salaries and commissions  and facility expenses for example  rent and utilities 
beginning in  in connection with the launch of our contemporary christian music format in several markets  we incurred increased amounts for promotional expenses and music license fees 
in addition to these expenses  our network incurs programming costs and lease expenses for satellite communication facilities 
we also incur and will continue to incur significant depreciation  amortization and interest expense as a result of completed and future acquisitions of radio stations and existing and future borrowings 
salem web network  our internet business  earns its revenue from the i sales of streaming services  ii sales of banner advertising and sponsorships on the internet  and  iii to a lesser extent  sales of software and software support contracts 
ccm  our publishing business  earns its revenue by selling advertising in and subscriptions to its publications 
the revenue and related operating expenses of these businesses are reported as other media on our consolidated statements of operations 
same station definition in the discussion of our results of operations below  we compare our results between periods on an as reported basis that is  the results of operations of all radio stations and network formats owned or operated at any time during either period and on a same station basis 
we include in our same station comparisons the results of operations of radio stations and networks that we own or operate in the same format during the current period compared with the results of the same stations and networks for the corresponding period of the prior year 
we do not include a station or a network in the comparison unless it has been owned or operated for at least an entire quarter included in each of the current and corresponding prior year periods 
results of operations we have reclassified our statements of operations data for all periods presented to reflect our sale on september  of the assets of radio station wygy fm  cincinnati  ohio  which has been accounted for as a discontinued operation 
in addition  we have reclassed barter transactions to reflect increases to revenues and expenses as appropriate  eliminating the practice of reporting these transactions net in our statements of operations

net income 
as a result of the above  we recognized net income of million in as compared to a net income of million in non gaap financial measures the performance of a radio broadcasting company is customarily measured by the ability of its stations to generate broadcast cash flow 
we define broadcast cash flow as net broadcasting revenue less broadcasting operating expenses 
although broadcast cash flow is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with gaap  it should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for our results of operations presented on the basis of gaap 
we use this financial measure because management believes it is useful for all investors and users of our financial statements in understanding our financial performance 
management believes that broadcast cash flow is useful because it is generally recognized by the radio broadcasting industry as a measure of performance and is used by investors and by analysts who report on the performance of broadcast companies 
broadcast cash flow is generally recognized as a tool in measuring performance and in applying valuation methodologies for companies in the media  entertainment and communications industries 
broadcast cash flow does not purport to represent cash provided by operating activities 
our statement of cash flows presents our cash flow activity and our income statement presents our historical performance prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
our broadcast cash flow is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  broadcast cash flow 
broadcast cash flow increased million or to million in from million in as a percentage of net broadcasting revenue  broadcast cash flow decreased to in from in the decrease is primarily attributable to the effect of fourteen radio stations acquired during and that previously operated with formats other than their current format and the effect of the launch of the contemporary christian music format in several markets 
acquired and reformatted radio stations typically produce low margins during the first few years following conversion 
broadcast cash flow margins improve as we implement scheduled program rate increases and increase advertising revenue on our stations

in addition  certain advertisers cancelled their advertising time 
as a consequence of these events  our financial results were adversely affected at the end of the third quarter and the fourth quarter of these events  as well as the military operations in afghanistan and iraq beginning in the fourth quarter of and the outbreak of the war in iraq commencing in the first quarter of  continued to have an adverse impact on advertising revenues throughout the year ended december  and will likely continue to have an adverse impact during further acts of war or terrorism against the united states  the united states response to any attacks  as well as future security threats may continue to affect our business operations and those of our advertisers and other customers 
we cannot predict the further negative effects these events may have on our business operations 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to allowance for doubtful accounts  acquisitions of radio station and network assets  goodwill and other intangible assets  barter transactions and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following accounting policies and the related judgments and estimates affect the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
acquisitions of radio station and network assets most of our radio station acquisitions have consisted primarily of the fcc licenses to broadcast in a particular market 
we often do not acquire the existing format  or we change the format upon acquisition when we find it beneficial 
as a result  a substantial portion of the purchase price for the assets of a radio station is allocated to the fcc license 
it is generally our policy to retain third party appraisers to value radio stations  networks or other media businesses under consideration for acquisition 
the allocations assigned to acquired fcc licenses and other assets are subjective by their nature and require our careful consideration and judgment 
we believe the allocations represent appropriate estimates of the fair value of the assets acquired 
as part of the valuation and appraisal process  the third party appraisers prepare reports which assign values to the various asset categories in our financial statements 
our management reviews these reports for reasonableness 
the reports form the basis to record the acquisition of the radio station  network or other media business at the close of the transaction 
when we exchange assets  we consider whether the exchange is an exchange of a business or otherwise requires the assets received to be recorded at fair value with the recognition of a gain or loss on the transaction  or the exchange is an exchange of similar productive assets that should be recorded on a historical cost basis with no gain or loss recorded 
in accordance with purchase accounting methodology  the operating results of the acquired assets and businesses are included in the consolidated operating results since the dates of acquisition 
allowance for bad debt we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
an analysis is performed by applying various percentages based on the age of the receivable and performing other subjective analysis 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the likelihood of ultimate realization of these receivables including the current creditworthiness of each customer 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
intangible assets under the financial accounting standards board s new rules  sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we will no longer amortize goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives  but will perform annual impairment tests in accordance with these statements 
we believe our fcc licenses have indefinite lives under the new standard and accordingly amortization expense will no longer be recorded for our fcc licenses as well as our goodwill effective july  for assets acquired subsequent to june  and effective january  for all other assets 
other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
we perform an annual test of impairment on our fcc licenses and our goodwill 
these tests include comparing the recorded values to the appraised values  calculations of discounted cash flows  operating income and other analyses 
as of december   based on our application of the impairment rules  no impairment was recorded 
the assessment of the fair values of these assets and the underlying businesses are estimates which require careful consideration and judgements by our management 
if conditions in the markets in which that our stations and other media businesses operate or if the operating results of our stations and other media businesses change or fail to develop as anticipated  our estimates of the fair values may change in the future and result in impairment charges 
valuation allowance deferred taxes for financial reporting purposes  the company has recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december  to offset a portion of the deferred tax assets related to the state net operating loss carryforwards 
management regularly reviews the company s financial forecasts in an effort to determine the realizability of the net operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes 
accordingly  the valuation allowance is adjusted periodically based on management s estimate of the benefit the company will receive from such carryforwards 
long term debt and debt covenant compliance our classification of our borrowings under our credit facility as long term debt in our balance sheet is based on our assessment that under the borrowing restrictions and covenants in our credit facility and after considering our projected operating results and cash flows for the coming year that no principal payments will be required pursuant to the credit agreement 
these projections are estimates which are inherantly uncertain and dependent upon a number of factors including developments in the markets in which we are operating in and economic and political factors  among other factors  our actual results could differ from these estimates 
should our actual results differ materially from these estimates  payments may become due under our credit facility or it may become necessary to seek an amendment to our credit facility 
based on our management s current assessment  we do not anticipate principal payments becoming due under our credit facilityor a further amendment of our credit facility becoming necessary

in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirement of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosure in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
we adopted this statement and its adoption did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed acquisitions of radio stations through borrowings  including borrowings under credit facilities and  to a lesser extent  from operating cash flow and selected asset dispositions 
we have historically funded  and will continue to fund  expenditures for operations  administrative expenses  capital expenditures and debt service required by our credit facility and the senior subordinated notes from operating cash flow and borrowings under our credit facility 
we believe that cash on hand  cash flow from operations  and borrowings under our credit facility will be sufficient to permit us to meet our financial obligations  fund pending acquisitions and fund operations for at least the next twelve months 
cash 
cash and cash equivalents was million at december  additionally  at december   we had million classified as restricted cash which was held in a trust account that was used to redeem on january  all of our outstanding million senior subordinated notes due plus accrued interest  and million held by a qualified intermediary under a like kind exchange agreement to preserve our ability to effect a tax deferred exchange 
working capital was million at december  cash and cash equivalents was million at december   including million held by a qualified intermediary under a like kind exchange agreement 
the increase in cash and cash equivalents is due to the cash proceeds received from our december issuance of our million senior subordinated notes due  cash provided by operating activities  borrowings from our revolving credit facility  and the sale of the assets of radio station wygy fm  cincinnati  ohio  for approximately million  offset by million used to acquire the assets of five radio stations and the assets of an internet business during the year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to million in the prior year  primarily due to a decrease in accounts receivable turnover and an increase in prepaid expenses  offset by an increase in broadcast cash flow 
net cash used by investing activities increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the prior year 
the increase is due to cash used for acquisitions cash used of million to purchase the assets of five radio stations and the assets of an internet business during the year ended december  as compared to cash used of million to purchase the assets of twelve radio stations and a network for the prior year offset by a decrease in capital expenditures and a decrease in proceeds from the sale of radio station assets million was received for the sale of wygy fm  cincinnati  ohio  in as compared to approximately million received in the sale of radio station kalc fm  denver  colorado  in 
net cash provided by financing activities increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the prior year

the credit facility matures on june  on march   we used million of excess cash to pay down our credit facility 
amounts outstanding under the credit facility bear interest at a base rate  at salem holding s option  of the bank s prime rate or libor  plus a spread 
for purposes of determining the interest rate under the credit facility  the prime rate spread ranges from to  and the libor spread ranges from to 
the maximum amount that salem holding may borrow under the credit facility is limited by a ratio of our consolidated existing total adjusted debt to pro forma twelve month cash flow the total adjusted funded debt to cash flow ratio 
the credit facility will allow us to adjust our total debt as used in such calculation by the lesser of of the aggregate purchase price of acquisitions of newly acquired non religious formatted radio stations that we reformat to a religious talk  conservative talk or religious music format or million and the cash flow from such stations will not be considered in the calculation of the ratio 
the maximum total adjusted funded debt to cash flow ratio allowed under the credit facility was to as of december  in march  we amended our credit facility to  among other things  extend the existing total adjusted funded debt to cash flow ratio through september  to not less than to  and to revise the minimum interest coverage ratio

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivative instruments we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates 
we actively monitor these fluctuations and use derivative instruments from time to time to manage the related risk 
in accordance with our risk management strategy  we use derivative instruments only for the purpose of managing risk associated with an asset  liability  committed transaction  or probable forecasted transaction that is identified by management 
our use of derivative instruments may result in short term gains or losses and may increase volatility in our earnings 
at december   an interest rate swap agreement with a notional principal amount of million was outstanding 
the interest rate swap agreement is used to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability that may result due to changes in interest rates 
this agreement expires in when the notes mature  and effectively swaps the fixed interest rate on million of our debt for a floating rate equal to the libor rate plus 
the estimated fair value of this swap agreement and the change in fair value of the debt hedged by the swap  based on current market rates  was million at december  the fair value of the swap agreement is included with long term assets  and the fair value of the debt hedged by the swap is recorded in long term debt consistent with the maturity date of the swap 
changes in the fair value of the swap and the changes in the fair value of the debt being hedged are recorded as part of interest expense 
because this fair value hedge is effective that is  the change in the fair value of the hedge instrument is designed to be equal to the change in the fair value of the item being hedged  there was no income statement effect relative to the change in the fair value of the swap agreement 
interest expense for the year ended december  was reduced by million as a result of the fixed interest rate on our debt and the floating interest rate under the swap agreement  which was as of december  the counter party to this interest rate swap agreement is a major financial institution 
although we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counter party  we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counter party nor would we expect any such loss to be material 
under sfas no 
 as amended  the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument at each new measurement date is dependent upon its intended use 
the change in the fair value of a derivative instrument designated as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or a firm commitment  referred to as a fair value hedge  is recognized as gain or loss in earnings in the period of the change together with an offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged 
the differential paid or received on the interest rate swap is recognized in earnings as an adjustment to interest expense 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
 as amended  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of sfas no 
 and sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities 
sfas no 
 as amended  requires all derivative instruments to be measured at fair value and recognized as either assets or liabilities 
in addition  all derivative instruments used in hedging transactions must be designated  reassessed and documented pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
 as amended 
market risk in addition to the interest rate swap agreement discussed above under derivative instruments  borrowings under the credit facility are subject to market risk exposure  specifically to changes in libor and in the prime rate in the united states 
at december   we had borrowed million under the credit facility 
as of december   we could borrow up to an additional million under the credit facility 
amounts outstanding under the credit facility bear interest at a base rate  at our option  of the banks prime rate or libor  plus a spread 
for purposes of determining the interest rate under the credit facility  the prime rate spread ranges from to  and the libor spread ranges from to 
at december   the blended interest rate on amounts outstanding under the credit facility was 
at december   a hypothetical basis point increase in the prime rate would result in additional interest expense of million on an annualized basis 
in addition to the variable rate debt disclosed above  we have fixed rate debt with a carrying value of million as of december   with an aggregate fair value of million 
we are exposed to changes in the fair value of these financial instruments based on changes in the market rate of interest on this debt 
the ultimate value of these notes will be determined by actual market prices  as all of these notes are tradeable 
we estimate that a hypothetical basis point increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease in the aggregate fair value of the notes to approximately million and a hypothetical basis point decrease in market interest rates would result in the increase of the fair value of the notes to approximately million
