item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
except for historical information  the discussion in this annual report contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act that involve risks and uncertainties 
the principal factors that could cause or contribute to differences in our actual results are discussed in the section titled factors that may affect future operating results 
overview tivo is a leading provider of television services for digital video recorders  or dvrs  a rapidly growing consumer electronics category 
our subscription based tivo service provides consumers with an easy way to record  watch  and control television 
the tivo service also offers advertisers  content creators  and television networks a new platform for promotions  content delivery  and audience research 
our goal is to build recurring revenues by developing advanced television services based on our patented technology 
today  tivo enabled dvrs are available in two configurations a standalone recorder  which works with all television signals cable  satellite  and antenna  and an integrated directv satellite receiver with tivo 
tivo enabled dvrs range in suggested retail price from to  and may be purchased at major consumer electronics retailers throughout the united states or through our website 
tivo series  a tivo branded dvr introduced last year  offers more recording capacity at a lower manufacturing cost than previous models  and it enables new entertainment services such as digital music  digital photos  remote scheduling and multi room viewing 
we derive revenues from three different sources 
first  we receive revenues for providing the tivo service to consumers and for providing advertising and research services 
we currently offer consumers a choice of a monthly recurring fee or a one time product lifetime subscription 
we also deliver the tivo service to customers of directv  one of the largest us multi channel service operators  in exchange for a monthly fee per household 
there are currently different dvr platforms which can deliver the tivo service  available from tivo and through four consumer electronics companies 
as of january   we had approximately  subscriptions  including  subscriptions through our relationship with directv 
in the year ended january   service revenues were of our total revenues  or million 
revenues from advertising and research services were not material for the fiscal year ended january  we also receive licensing and engineering professional services revenues from companies that create products that provide dvr functionality 
we have an extensive portfolio of patents for inventions associated with the unique features of the tivo service  and for dvr software and hardware design 
current licensees of our technology include sony  toshiba america consumer products  inc and toshiba semiconductor 
current engineering professional services customers include directv  toshiba  sony  aol time warner  and others 
in the year ended january   we derived of our revenues  or million  from licensing and engineering professional services 
third  we receive revenues from the sale of dvr hardware 
we hired a contract manufacturer to build the tivo series dvr 
we distribute these dvrs  selling them both directly to consumers and to major retailers who offer these products to consumers 
we distribute these dvrs solely to enable our service revenues and  as a result  do not presently intend to generate gross profits from hardware 
in the year ended january   we derived of our revenues  or million  from hardware sales 
we do not  however  recognize any hardware revenue related to the sale of tivo enabled dvrs built and distributed by other consumer electronics manufacturers 

table of contents tivo was incorporated in august as a delaware corporation with facilities in alviso  california 
in august of  we formed a wholly owned subsidiary  tivo uk ltd  in the united kingdom 
in october of  we formed a new subsidiary  tivo international  inc  a delaware corporation 
we conduct our operations through one reportable segment 
we continue to be subject to certain risks  including the dependence on third parties for manufacturing  marketing and sales support  the uncertainty of the market for digital video recorders  dependence on key management  limited manufacturing  marketing and sales experience  and the uncertainty of future profitability and positive cash flow 
additionally  we operate in an emerging industry and face significant competition 
our success is dependent upon the market s acceptance of the tivo service and the dvrs which enable the tivo service 
to date  we have recognized limited revenue  have incurred significant losses and have had substantial negative cash flow 
during the fiscal year ended january   we had net losses of million 
as of january   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents  together with funds generated from operations  will be sufficient to fund our operations  capital expenditures and working capital needs through the next twelve months 
sources of revenues our revenues for the fiscal years ended january  and january   the one month transition period ended january  and calendar year ended december  as a percentage of total revenues were as follows revenues fiscal year ended january  fiscal year ended january  one month ended january  calendar year ended december  service revenues technology revenues hardware revenues revenues from advertising and research services included in service revenues were not material during these periods 
for the fiscal year ended january  one customer generated million of technology revenues and one customer generated million of hardware revenues  which accounted for and of total revenues  respectively 
subscriber growth we market the tivo service in two ways 
first  we sell directly to consumers who have purchased a tivo enabled dvr 
we sell the tivo service for either a monthly subscription rate of  or for a single payment of for the lifetime of the dvr 
second  we market our service through our relationship with directv 
directv pays us a per household monthly fee for the ability to offer our service to their customers 
directv makes all pricing decisions regarding the service it sells to its own customer base 
in order to receive directv or other satellite or cable service  the consumer must purchase the subscription television service from that provider 

table of contents below is a table that details the growth in our subscription base during the past eight quarters 
the tivo service subscriptions lines refer to standalone tivo dvrs  including those manufactured by tivo  sony  philips and others 
the service provider subscriptions line items refer to integrated directv satellite receivers with tivo 
additionally  we provide a breakdown of the percent of tivo service subscriptions excluding integrated directv dvrs for which we are paid on a recurring monthly or annual basis 
a subscription is a dvr for which i a customer has paid for the tivo service and ii service is not canceled 
for households with multiple dvrs  we count each dvr as a subscription 
three months ended apr  jul  oct  jan  apr  jul  oct  jan  subscriptions in thousands tivo service subscriptions net additions service provider subscriptions net additions total subscriptions net additions tivo service cumulative subscriptions service provider cumulative subscriptions total cumulative subscriptions of tivo service cumulative subscriptions paying recurring fees during the year ended january   we activated approximately  new subscriptions to the tivo service  bringing the total installed subscription base to approximately  as of january   approximately greater than the installed base as of january  we intend to generate continued subscriber growth through close direct relationships with leading retailers like best buy  circuit city  and others 
these relationships increase the supply of tivo enabled dvrs and provide marketing and distribution support  allowing us to increase subscriptions 
we also intend to generate significant subscription growth through relationships similar to our revised agreements with directv and our agreements with consumer electronics manufacturers such as sony  pursuant to which these third parties manufacture and or market and distribute tivo enabled platforms through their own distribution and marketing networks 
we intend to continue to invest limited amounts in general sales and marketing expenditures to support subscriber growth 
how a consumer becomes a tivo customer to use the tivo service  consumers need to purchase a dvr that is compatible with the tivo service manufactured by us or one of our third party manufacturers 
our third party manufacturers have been thomson multimedia  philips  hughes and sony and are currently philips  hughes and sony 
each of these companies is currently or has in the past manufactured and distributed their own branded tivo enabled dvrs 
consumers can purchase a dvr compatible with the tivo service at major retailers across the united states  including best buy  circuit city  amazon 
com  tweeter  the good guys  abt electronics and ultimate electronics 
once the consumer has purchased a tivo enabled dvr they can choose to contact us to purchase and activate the tivo service 
we are solely responsible for the activation of the tivo service to the tivo enabled dvrs manufactured by us or our third party manufacturers 
subscriptions to the tivo service are available on a monthly or lifetime basis 
the current price for a monthly subscription to the tivo service is and the price for a lifetime subscription is 
a lifetime subscription allows access to the tivo service for the life of the dvr 
subscription fees are paid by the viewer when activating the tivo service 
dvrs that are compatible with the tivo service have minimal functionality without a subscription to the tivo service 
these dvrs can be used to pause  rewind and fast forward through live or recorded shows 

table of contents licensing and engineering professional services activities we have close relationships with a variety of the manufacturers and distributors of tivo enabled dvrs for the purpose of creating an open standards platform for dvrs  thus earning licensing revenue 
we have software licenses and engineering professional services agreements including agreements with sony  toshiba america consumer products  inc and toshiba semiconductor 
we offer engineering development as engineering professional services to companies interested in having dvr technology developed for their products 
in february  we signed an agreement with directv making us the primary provider of dvr technology for directv s integrated digital satellite receivers 
we also have engineering professional services agreements with aol time warner 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that our most critical accounting policies are those described below 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see item note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition based on the guidance provided by securities and exchange commission  staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured  and we have received customer acceptance  or are otherwise released from our service obligation or customer acceptance obligations 
we recognize hardware revenues from the sales of our tivo manufactured series tivo enabled dvrs 
hardware revenues are recognized upon shipment to consumers and upon delivery to retail customers 
the fees for shipping and handling paid by customers are recognized as hardware revenues 
the cost associated with shipping and handling these series tivo enabled dvrs are expensed as cost of hardware revenues 
fees for shipping and handling paid by customers and the associated costs are recognized under the provisions of eitf lifetime subscriptions tivo offers a lifetime subscription option for the life of the dvr for a one time  upfront payment 
subscription revenues from lifetime subscriptions are recognized ratably over a four year period  the best estimate of the useful life of the digital video recorder 
if the useful life of the recorder was shorter or longer than the estimated four year period  revenues would be recognized earlier or later  respectively  than our current policy 
our product is still relatively new and as more user information is gathered  this estimated life could be revised 

table of contents engineering professional services technology revenues for engineering professional services that are essential to the functionality of the software or involve significant customization or modification  are generally recognized using the percentage of completion method  as described in sop accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  since we believe we are able to make reasonably dependable estimates of the extent of progress toward completion 
we measure progress toward completion based on the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs  an input method 
we believe we are able to reasonably estimate  track and project the remaining progress toward completion 
had different cost estimates been used  or different methods of measuring progress to completion  our revenues and expenses during the period may have been materially different 
to date we have engineering professional service agreements with directv and aol for which we use the percentage of completion method for revenue recognition 
complex agreements we have a number of related party transactions and commitments 
many of these transactions are complex and involve multiple elements and types of consideration  including cash  debt  equity  and services 
for example  our relationship with directv has historically included subscription revenue share expense  engineering professional services revenue  common stock and warrants issued for services and various platform subsidies 
many of our arrangements require us to make estimations for the valuation of non cash expenses  such as warrants issued for services  which must be assigned a value using financial models that require us to estimate certain parameters 
we have utilized our best estimate of the value of the various elements in accounting for these transactions 
had alternative assumptions been used  the values obtained may have been materially different 
we recognize revenue under technology license and engineering professional services agreements in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountant s statement of position   software revenue recognition 
these agreements contain multiple element arrangements in which vendor specific objective evidence of fair value is required for all undelivered elements in order to recognize license revenue 
we have entered into additional technology licensing transactions  and the timing of revenue recognition related to these transactions will depend  in part  on whether we can establish vendor specific objective evidence for undelivered elements and on how these transactions are structured 
as such  revenue recognition may not correspond to the timing of related cash flows or our work effort 
during the fiscal year ended january   we recognized technology revenue of approximately million and million  respectively  of technology licensing and engineering professional services revenues from sony 
we also recognize revenue in accordance with sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts in connection with arrangements consisting of a technology software license  engineering professional services and maintenance for the term of the contract 
contract accounting is applied to these arrangements due to significant customization of the software in the form of engineering professional services 
there is no objective fair value of the maintenance since maintenance is included in the term of the contract with no quoted renewal rates or is mandatory in order to continue to manufacture the product 
therefore  we apply contract accounting by recognizing revenue to the extent of contract costs until the engineering customization services are complete 
in accordance with sop paragraph c  we use a zero estimate of profit because estimating the final outcome may be impractical except to assure that no loss will be incurred 
since we cannot estimate the total amount of profit for all of the elements in the contract but we can estimate that no loss will be incurred  we are recognizing revenue at a zero profit margin until we are finished with the engineering professional services project and deliver the license 
the remainder of the profit will be recognized on a straight line basis over the period that the maintenance and basic dvr service  if applicable  are delivered 
amounts received prior to the recognition of revenue will be deferred 
to date we have agreements with these arrangements with toshiba corporation  toshiba semiconductor and one other customer 

table of contents consumer rebates in accordance with eitf  we recorded the maximum potential liability for our consumer rebate program since we cannot reasonably and reliably estimate the amount of rebates that will ultimately be redeemed 
the maximum amount was estimated based on the number of receivers that were with sold or available for sale during the rebate period 
as of january   we recorded an accrual of million for rebates 
upon completion of the consumer rebate program  any unredeemed consumer rebate expense will be reversed 
the consumer rebates are recognized as rebates  revenue share and other payments to channel in our consolidated financial statements 
stock based compensation we have a history of issuing stock options to employees and directors as an integral part of our compensation programs 
generally accepted accounting principles allow alternative methods of accounting for these plans 
we have chosen to account for our stock option plans under apb opinion no 
 which requires that only the intrinsic value of stock option grants be recognized as an expense on our consolidated statement of operations 
accordingly  no compensation expense related to the time value of stock options is included in determining net loss and net loss per share in our consolidated financial statements 
the alternative method of accounting for stock options is prescribed by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 and requires that both the intrinsic value and time value of options be recognized as an expense for employee stock option awards 
had we used sfas no 
to value our employee stock option awards  our net loss and net loss per share would have been greater for all periods presented 
we also have issued warrants to non employees for consulting services 
we have used black scholes option pricing model to calculate the estimated fair market value of these warrants 
several assumptions are made in the model such as the term and risk free rate of return 
if market conditions at the time the non employee exercises the warrants are different than those on the date on which the assumptions are based  the valuation of the warrants could significantly increase or decrease from the estimated calculations and our expense would be different 
contingent liabilities the company is involved in numerous lawsuits in the ordinary course of its business 
we assess potential liabilities in connection with these lawsuits under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies 
we accrue an estimated loss from these loss contingencies if both of the following conditions are met information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
as of january   we have not accrued a liability for any of the lawsuits filed against us as the conditions for accrual have not been met 
valuation allowance against deferred tax assets we provided a valuation allowance of million against our entire net deferred tax asset  primarily consisting of net operating loss carryforwards as of january  and the valuation allowance was recorded given the losses we incurred through january  and and our uncertainties regarding future operating profitability and taxable income 
if we do not achieve profitability  we will not fully realize the deferred tax benefits 
results of operations on february   we announced a fiscal year end change from december of each year to january of each year 
we changed our fiscal year end because we experience our heaviest subscriber growth during the 
table of contents months of november  december and january following the retail cycle of the holiday season 
we believe that the great majority of these activations are a result of dvrs purchased during the holiday season or received as holiday gifts and subsequently activated 
we changed our fiscal year end by one month in order to capture all of the activations due to the holiday season in the last quarter of our fiscal year 
the months of november  december and january accounted for and of total new subscriptions for the fiscal years ended january  and  respectively 
we have experienced declines in our subscription growth from february through july  with the lowest growth usually in july 
typically  each year subscriptions begin to significantly increase in september 
we believe that this is due in part to the new fall season programming lineups 
the following discussion of historical operating results compares the fiscal year ended january  to fiscal year ended january   and fiscal year ended january  to the fiscal year ended december   respectively 
although the january  and december  fiscal years are not identical year comparisons  we are including the periods in the discussion since both years have been audited 
because there is no comparable audited period and the company believes that such a comparison would not aid the reader of this annual report in interpreting the historical trends of the company s results of operations  the company has elected not to compare the one month transition period ended january  to a comparable unaudited period in the prior calendar year 
year ended january  compared to the year ended january  service revenues 
service revenues for the year ended january  were million  double the million of service revenues for the year ended january  during the year ended january   we activated approximately  new subscriptions to the tivo service bringing the total installed subscription base to approximately  as of january   approximately greater than the installed base as of january  we anticipate fiscal year will have continued revenue growth as our subscription base grows 
non subscription revenues primarily includes advertising and sponsorship revenue from consumer companies and media networks that have provided content on the tivo service and from our audience measurement research customers 
revenues from advertising and research services included in service revenues were not material during these periods 
technology revenues 
technology revenues consist of revenues generated from licensing our technology to consumer electronics companies and service providers for the purpose of creating an open standards platform design for dvrs 
also included in technology revenues are engineering professional services revenues for engineering services performed 
technology revenues for the year ended january  were million due to the recognition of technology licensing and engineering professional services revenue compared to  for the fiscal year ended january  during the fiscal year ended january   one customer generated technology revenues of million  which accounted for of total revenues 
we anticipate that we will recognize additional revenue from technology licenses and engineering professional services agreements in the fiscal year ending january  as of january   we have entered into four licensing agreements 
hardware revenues 
hardware revenues for the fiscal year ended january  was million compared to zero for the fiscal year ended january  during the fiscal year ended january   one customer generated million of hardware revenues which accounted for of total revenues 
for comparability purposes  beginning in the quarter ended july  we are showing the revenue and cost of hardware revenues of series platforms separately on the face of our financial statements 
we introduced our new series tivo enabled dvrs in january we sell these units to retailers and distributors  and directly to consumers through our online sales efforts 
rebates  revenue share and other payments to channel 
during the fiscal year ended january   sony and at t broadband became customers of tivo and we entered into several retailer agreements 
in 
table of contents accordance with eitf  we concluded that the revenue share and subsidy payments made to these customers is presumed to be a reduction of the selling prices of our products or services and  therefore  should be characterized as a reduction of revenues when recognized on our income statement 
additionally  in accordance with eitf we classified consumer rebates as a reduction of revenues for rebate programs that began october  and will end april  also in accordance with eitf  we recorded the maximum potential liability for our consumer rebate programs based on the number of dvrs that were either sold or available for sale during the rebate periods 
as of january   we recorded a million accrual for consumer rebates 
following the final calculation of actual rebate fulfillment  we will reverse any unredeemed consumer rebate expense that was accrued 
cost of service revenues 
cost of service revenues for the fiscal year ended january  was million compared to million for the fiscal year ended january  costs of revenues consist primarily of telecommunication and network expenses  employee salaries  call center and other expenses related to providing the tivo service to subscribers 
total salaries and benefits for the fiscal year ended january  decreased compared to the same time during the prior year due to reductions in staffing 
additionally  telecommunications and network expense decreased by  or over million  for the fiscal year ended january  this decrease was a result of continued reduction of the service cost per subscriber including using satellite transmission of the tivo service for subscribers using the directv receiver with tivo 
we expect to continue to control spending in our broadcast and customer service operations  resulting in further reductions in our per subscriber cost of revenue 
cost of technology revenues 
cost of technology revenues consist of expenses related to providing engineering professional services to our customers  including employee salaries and related costs  as well as prototyping and other material costs 
cost of technology revenues was million for the fiscal year ended january  compared to  for the fiscal year ended january  cost of hardware revenues 
cost of hardware revenues for the fiscal year ended january  was million compared to zero for the fiscal year ended january  costs of hardware revenues include all product costs as well as direct costs associated with the series platforms  including manufacturing related overhead and personnel  certain licensing expenses  and order fulfillment expenses such as shipping costs 
we expect these costs per unit to reduce over time as the cost of manufacturing the dvrs decreases 
research and development expenses 
our research and development expenses consist primarily of employee salaries and related expenses and consulting fees 
research and development expenses for the fiscal year ended january  were million  lower than the year ago period 
as a percentage of total revenues  research and development expenses were for fiscal year ended january  research and development expenses decreased from the fiscal year ended january  due to the redeployment of engineers from research and development activities to engineering professional services activities which are classified as costs of technology revenues 
for the fiscal year ended january   engineering expenses increased as compared to the prior year due to increased salary expense 
we expect our research and development expenses to decline in the fiscal year ending january  due to agreements that include substantial funded engineering from our customers to tivo 
research and development expenses that are related to the deployment of engineers to complete engineering professional services are classified as costs of technology revenues 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee salaries and related expenses  media advertising  public relations activities  special promotions  trade shows and the production of product related items  including collateral and videos 
sales and marketing expenses for the fiscal year ended january  were million  lower than sales and marketing expenses for the corresponding fiscal year period 
sales and marketing expenses were of total revenues for the fiscal year ended january  the largest contributor to the reduction of total sales and marketing expenses in terms of absolute dollars was ad media placement 
year over year  ad media placement decreased by or 
table of contents million 
other contributors were public relation expense and trade show expense that declined year over year by or  and by or  respectively 
we expect our marketing expenses for the fiscal year ending january  to be comparable to the fiscal year ended january sales and marketing related parties expense 
sales and marketing related parties expense consists of cash and non cash charges related primarily to agreements with parties that held stock in us 
sales and marketing related parties expense for the fiscal year ended january  were million  lower than sales and marketing related parties expense in the corresponding fiscal year period 
sales and marketing related parties expense for the fiscal year ended january   consisted of cash charges of million and non cash charges of million 
sales and marketing related parties expense for the same period in the prior fiscal year consisted of cash charges of million and non cash charges of million 
the cash portion of sales and marketing related parties expense is comprised of revenue share and manufacturing subsidy payments to philips  sony  maxtor  formerly known as quantum  and directv 
also included are media insertion orders paid to nbc and aol 
we have also agreed to share a portion of our revenues with some of our customers and consumer electronics manufactures in order to promote the tivo service and encourage the manufacture and distribution of the digital video recorders that enable the tivo service 
revenue share is calculated as an agreed upon percentage of revenue for a specified group of tivo subscriptions 
we had negotiated deferred payment schedules of payables due as of march  in the amount of million reflected in accrued liabilities related parties as of january  these amounts  including interest  were paid in full as of january  the non cash portion is related to the amortization of prepaid marketing expense related to warrants or common stock issued for services to aol  creative artists agency  llc and directv 
we amortize the prepaid marketing expense on a straight line basis over the period that the services are provided 
approximately of the total sales and marketing related parties expense for the fiscal year ended january   million  was non cash expense related to the remaining unamortized portion of the prepaid marketing expense related to the june investment agreement with aol which was terminated by funds release agreement in april see
