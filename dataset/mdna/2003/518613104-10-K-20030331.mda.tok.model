critical accounting policies and estimates the company s accounting policies are more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as disclosed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to the financial statements 
the company believes the following key accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements and are critical to its business operations and the understanding of its results of operations 
revenue recognition 
revenue from the sale of educational products is generally recognized when shipped 
revenue from educational services are recognized in the period services are provided 
as the company continues to integrate educational product and service businesses  the resulting business structure may impact the revenue recognition of product sales to affiliated educational service providers 
educational services provided by the company include results oriented english language instruction modules that are based on desired proficiency levels 
the related revenue is recognized ratably over the estimated period required to complete the modules  which ranges from months to months  depending on the location that the services are provided 
the company estimates the period of instruction based on an analysis of actual historical activity by location 
if the historical data the company uses to calculate these estimates does not properly reflect future usage  revenue recognized by the company may be negatively impacted 
additionally  if usage trends change over time  the company may have significant fluctuations in recognized revenues in the future 
a portion of the company s revenue is derived from fixed price contracts with school districts  which are accounted for under the proportional performance method 
contract revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the contract and expenses are recognized in an amount equal to the ratio of estimated total expenses to the total contract value 
if the company does not accurately estimate the resources required  does not manage its contracts properly within the planned periods of time  or does not satisfy its obligations under the contracts  future margins may be negatively impacted or losses on existing contracts may need to be recognized 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
during each of the years presented  the company acquired certain businesses accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
a portion of the purchase prices for these businesses was allocated to identifiable tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities based on estimated fair values at the dates of acquisitions 
any excess purchase price was allocated to goodwill 
this goodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles are evaluated at least annually for impairment by comparison of the carrying amounts of the respective reporting units to their implied fair value determined by discounting estimated future cash flows expected from the reporting units 
other intangible assets include acquired student rosters  accreditation  non competition agreements and curriculum 
the assumptions used to calculate the fair value of these identified intangible assets included estimates of future operating results and cash flows  as well as discount rates based on specifically identified risks for each acquisition and assumptions about the weighted average cost of capital for each acquisition 
the assigned useful lives  which range from to years  are based upon estimated matriculation rates and other factors 
if the company used different assumptions and estimates in the calculation of the fair value of identified intangible assets and the estimation of the related useful lives  the amounts allocated to these assets  as well as the related amortization expense  could have been significantly different than the amounts recorded 
in assessing the recoverability of the company s goodwill and other intangible assets  the company must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
in  the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which required the company to analyze its goodwill for impairment upon adoption 
as a result  the company recorded a non cash charge of million  net of income tax benefit of million  which is included as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the consolidated statements of operations 
investment in affiliated companies and other investments 
the company holds minority interests in companies having operations or technology in areas within its strategic focus  some of which are non publicly traded companies whose value is difficult to determine 
at december  these investments had a carrying value of approximately million 
the company records an investment impairment charge when it believes an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments may require management to make subjective judgments about the recoverability of its investments 
due to the inherent subjectivity of the valuation of minority investments in companies without readily ascertainable fair values  it is reasonably possible that events or circumstances could change in the near term and thereby change management s estimates of the recoverability of its investments 
income taxes 
the company earns a significant portion of its income from subsidiaries located in countries outside of the united states 
at december   undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries totaled approximately million 
deferred tax liabilities have not been recognized for these undistributed earnings because it is management s intention to reinvest such undistributed earnings outside of the united states 
apb opinion no 
 accounting for income taxes special areas  requires that a company evaluate its circumstances to determine whether or not there is sufficient evidence to support the assertion that it has or will reinvest undistributed foreign earnings indefinitely 
the company s assertion that earnings from its foreign operations will be permanently reinvested is supported by projected working capital and long term capital needs in each subsidiary location in which the earnings are generated  as well as similar considerations for domestic operations 
additionally  the company believes that it has the ability to permanently reinvest foreign earnings based on a review of projected cash flows from domestic operations  projected working capital and liquidity for both short term and long term domestic needs  and the expected availability of debt or equity markets to provide funds for those domestic needs 
if circumstances change and it becomes apparent that some or all of the undistributed earnings of the company s foreign subsidiaries will be remitted in the foreseeable future  the company will be required to recognize deferred tax liabilities on those amounts 
as of december   if all undistributed earnings had been remitted to the united states  the amount of incremental us federal income tax liabilities  net of foreign tax credits  would have been approximately million of which million relates to discontinued operations 
the company has generated significant deferred tax assets  primarily as a result of its equity in the net losses of affiliated companies 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized 
the primary factor used by the company to determine the amount of valuation allowance needed to offset deferred tax assets related to these losses is that when realized  these capital losses may be carried back to offset the company s substantial prior year capital gains  subject to certain limitations 
the company also has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the amount of valuation allowance needed 
if the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should the company determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 
accounts and notes receivable 
the company s accounts receivable consist primarily of installment payments due from parents and students for tuition at learning centers and universities  related fees that are payable over the course of payment plans of up to nine months  and amounts due from franchisees for franchise fees  franchise royalties and didactic material purchases 
notes receivable consist primarily of loans to franchisees  which are generally collateralized 
the company routinely makes estimates of the collectibility of its accounts and notes receivable 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers and franchisees to make required payments 
the company estimates the amount of the required allowance by reviewing the status of past due receivables and analyzing historical bad debt trends 
actual collection experience has not varied significantly from estimates  due primarily to credit policies  collection experience  and a lack of concentration of amount receivable 
if the financial condition of the company s customers and franchisees were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss to future earnings  to fair values or to future cash flows that may result from the changes in the price of financial instruments 
the company is exposed to financial market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates  equity prices and investment values 
the company occasionally uses derivative financial instruments to protect against adverse currency movements related to significant foreign acquisitions 
exposure to market risks related to operating activities is managed through the company s regular operating and financing activities 
foreign currency risk the company derives approximately of its revenues from customers outside the united states 
this business is transacted through a network of international subsidiaries  generally in the local currency that is considered the functional currency of that foreign subsidiary 
expenses are also incurred in the foreign currencies to match revenues earned and minimize the company s exchange rate exposure to operating margins 
a hypothetical adverse change in average annual foreign currency exchange rates would have increased net loss and decreased cash flows for the fiscal year by million 
the company generally views its investment in most of its foreign subsidiaries as long term 
the effects of a change in foreign currency exchange rates on the company s net investment in foreign subsidiaries are reflected in other comprehensive income loss 
a depreciation in functional currencies relative to the us dollar would have resulted in a decrease in the company s net investment in foreign subsidiaries of approximately million at december  interest rate risk the company holds its cash and cash equivalents in high quality  short term  fixed income securities 
consequently  the fair value of the company s cash and cash equivalents would not be significantly impacted by either a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates due to the short term nature of the company s portfolio 
the company s long term revolving credit facility bears interest at variable rates  and the fair value of this instrument is not significantly affected by changes in market interest rates 
the company s convertible debentures bear interest at  which currently approximates the market rate 
a basis point decrease in interest rates would have reduced net interest income for the fiscal year by million 
equity price risk the fair value of the company s convertible debentures is sensitive to fluctuations in the price of the company s common stock into which the debentures are convertible 
changes in equity prices would result in changes in the fair value of the company s convertible debentures due to the difference between the current market price of the debentures and the market price at the date of issuance of the debentures 
a increase in the year end market price of the company s common stock would result in an increase of approximately million in the net fair value of the debentures 
the company is exposed to equity price risks on equity securities included in the portfolio of investments entered into for the promotion of business and strategic objectives 
the company typically does not attempt to reduce or eliminate its market exposure on these securities 
a adverse change in equity prices would not materially impact the fair value of the company s marketable securities or other comprehensive income loss 
investment risk the company s investment portfolio contains debt securities that mature within one year 
a hypothetical adverse change in the fair value of the debt securities would not materially adversely impact earnings or cash flows because of the company s ability to hold the debt securities until maturity 
in addition to the debt securities  the company has an investment portfolio that consists of direct investment positions in education technology companies through sylvan ventures  as well as short term investments in available for sale debt and equity securities 
the company s investment portfolio is exposed to risks arising from changes in these investment values 
the company s investment portfolio includes a number of holdings of non publicly traded companies in the educational services industry 
the company accounts for these investments using either the cost method cost less impairment  if any or the equity method of accounting 
equity method investments are specifically excluded from the scope of this disclosure 
non public investments where the company owns less than a interest are subject to fluctuations in market value  but their current illiquidity reduces the exposure to pure market risk while increasing the risk that the company may not be able to liquidate these investments in a timely manner for their estimated fair value 
all the potential impacts noted above are based on sensitivity analysis performed on the company s financial position at december  actual results may differ materially
