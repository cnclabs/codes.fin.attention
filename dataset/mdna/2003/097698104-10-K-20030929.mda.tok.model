this discussion includes forward looking statements about the demand for our products and future results 
please refer to the note regarding forward looking statements section of this form k 
overview sales of the company s geophysical products are generally related to the level of worldwide oil and gas exploration and development activity which is dependent  primarily  on oil and gas prices 
because of a rapid decline in oil prices in  oil companies reduced exploration budgets which caused the company s customers  primarily seismic exploration contractors  to reduce activities 
this reduction in activity resulted in underutilized and idle seismic vessels 
during the last half of fiscal and in fiscal  there was an increase in marine seismic exploration activity which benefited the company s geophysical equipment sales and profitability 
however  during fiscal  despite high oil prices  the energy industry became increasingly more cautious on exploration spending 
the company believes this caution reflects uncertain economic and political outlooks 
this slowdown in marine seismic exploration activity was industry wide 
the company did not ship any complete energy source systems until late in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and sales of air gun replacement parts and underwater electrical connectors were depressed during fiscal fiscal sales in the industrial products segment of the company s business improved over the prior year  reflecting the addition of new customers and higher volume for existing customers 
liquidity and capital resources at june   the company had  in cash and cash equivalents 
for the year ended june   cash and cash equivalents increased by  cash flow from operating activities after changes in operating assets and liabilities was  for the year ended june   primarily due to a decrease in the level of accounts receivable partially offset by the fiscal net loss  higher inventories and lower accrued liabilities 
for the year ended june   the company used  for capital expenditures for replacement equipment  funded from operating cash flow 
the company estimates that capital expenditures for fiscal year will be approximately  the company expects to fund these capital expenditures from operating cash flow 
at june   the company had  in cash and cash equivalents 
for the year ended june   cash and cash equivalents increased by  cash flow from operating activities after changes in operating assets and liabilities was  for the year ended june   primarily due to net income and a decrease in the level of accounts receivable 
for the year ended june   the company used  for capital expenditures and  for the scheduled payments of a note issued in connection with the acquisition of a g geophysical products  inc in in april  the final payment was made and all obligations under this note were satisfied 
in may  the company entered into a one year  unsecured line of credit agreement with a bank to support working capital requirements 
the company never borrowed under this facility which expired in may the company is currently evaluating its requirements with respect to arranging a new facility 
under the terms of the asset purchase agreement for custom products  the company could have been required to make additional annual payments to the former owners of custom products in the maximum amount of  if net sales of custom products increased to certain levels by december no payments were required under this agreement because the sales did not meet amounts specified in the agreement 
in october  the company s board of directors approved a stock repurchase program under which the company was authorized to buy up to  shares of its common stock in open market or private transactions 
although the program remains authorized  the company has not repurchased any shares and currently has no plan to make repurchases 
current cash and cash equivalent balances and projected cash flow from operations are considered adequate to meet foreseeable operating needs 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no off balance sheet financing arrangements 
in addition  the company does not have any relationship with unconsolidated entities or any special purpose entities and has not issued any guarantees 
contractual obligations the company has no long term borrowings  capital leases  purchase obligations or other long term liabilities at june  and the company is obligated for minimum lease payments as of june  under several operating leases for its facilities as follows contractual obligations total payments due by period less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations such amounts are exclusive of any additional rent for taxes  utilities or similar charges  under triple net leases 
see note to the consolidated financial statements under lease commitments  for further information of future payments and other information relating to such leases 
results of operations year ended june  compared to year ended june  sales for the year ended june  decreased by  or  from the year ended june  sales of geophysical equipment decreased by  or  reflecting the industry wide slowdown in marine seismic activity due to cautious exploration spending by energy companies which  in turn  resulted in lower demand for air guns  air gun replacement parts and underwater connectors by seismic marine exploration contractors  which are the company s major customers 
this decrease was partially offset by a  or sales increase in sales of industrial products compared to the year ended june   as that business began to show improvement from the prior year due to improved conditions in the domestic economy 
with such improvement  this segment was able to add new customers and achieve higher sales volumes from existing customers 
consolidated cost of sales as a percentage of consolidated sales increased from for the year ended june  to for the year ended june  this increase was due primarily to the geophysical equipment segment 
cost of sales for the geophysical equipment segment increased from for the year ended june  to for the year ended june   due primarily to lower manufacturing efficiencies associated with the sales decrease mentioned above 
in addition  cost of sales for the geophysical equipment segment for the year ended june  includes a charge of  to increase the inventory valuation reserve to recognize that the current supply of certain inventory items exceeds estimated future demand resulting from the industry wide slowdown in marine seismic activity during the year ended june  cost of sales for the industrial products segment decreased from for the year ended june  to for the year ended june  reflecting slightly higher manufacturing efficiencies resulting from the increase in sales 
research and development expense decreased by  or for fiscal year over fiscal year because a major research and development program  the apg gun  reached near completion in the fourth quarter of fiscal year selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by  or for the year ended june  versus the year ended june   primarily due to lower compensation costs  and lower bad debt expense 
the company conducted  with the assistance of an independent valuation firm  an annual impairment test of goodwill balance as of july  the results of the test indicated that there was no impairment of the july  goodwill balance 
interest expense for the year ended june  was zero versus  for the year ended june  the reason for this decrease was the payment in full in april of the note issued in connection with the a g geophysical products  inc acquisition 
the provision for income taxes for the year ended june  was a benefit of  reflecting a loss before income taxes of  and an increase in net deferred tax assets partially offset by state income taxes 
the provision for income taxes for the year ended june  was  an effective tax rate of  which was higher than the federal statutory rate of primarily due to the effect of state income taxes 
the above mentioned factors resulted in a net loss for the year ended june  of  compared to net income of  for the year ended june  year ended june  compared to year ended june  sales for the year ended june  increased by  or from the year ended june  sales of geophysical equipment increased by  or  reflecting an increase in marine seismic exploration activity which started in the fourth quarter of fiscal year this increase was partially offset by a  or decrease in sales of industrial products compared to the year ended june   as that business was adversely affected by the continuing domestic economic slowdown 
consolidated cost of sales as a percentage of consolidated sales decreased from for the year ended june  to for the year ended june  this decrease was due primarily to the geophysical equipment segment 
cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the geophysical equipment segment decreased from for the year ended june  to for the year ended june  due primarily to higher manufacturing efficiencies associated with the sales increase mentioned above 
cost of sales for the industrial products segment increased from for the year ended june  to for the year ended june  reflecting lower manufacturing efficiencies resulting from the decrease in sales 
research and development expense decreased by  or for fiscal year over fiscal year because the apg gun project was reaching its final stages 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by  or for the year ended june  versus the year ended june  primarily due to higher compensation costs 
as indicated in note to the consolidated financial statements  sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  was adopted by the company effective july  accordingly  there was no goodwill amortization for the year ended june  for the year ended june   goodwill amortization was  the company had been amortizing goodwill prior to july  over years 
if the adoption of sfas no 
had been in effect on july   the reported net income of  for the year ended june  would have increased to  goodwill was tested for impairment as of july   the initial test  and as of july   the first annual test 
both tests were conducted by management with the assistance of an independent valuation company and the results of both tests indicated no impairment 
interest expense for the year ended june  was  which was  less than the previous fiscal year due to the lower average balance outstanding on the a g geophysical products  inc note 
the provision for income taxes for the year ended june  was  an effective tax rate of  which was higher than the federal statutory rate of primarily due to the effect of state income taxes 
the company s tax provision for the year ended june  of  on income before taxes of  was significantly higher than the federal statutory rate of primarily due to the effect of goodwill amortization relating to the a g geophysical products  inc acquisition which was not deductible for income tax purposes and a reduction in the amount of investment tax credit carry forwards 
the above mentioned factors resulted in a net income for the year ended june  of  compared to net income of  for the year ended june  critical accounting policies the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying the accounting policies most critical to our financial statements have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements 
the us securities and exchange commission has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results  and require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments 
based on this definition  our most critical policies include recording of inventory reserves  deferred taxes  and the assessment of recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets 
we discuss these policies further below 
we also have other key accounting policies including policies for revenue recognition and establishment of bad debt reserves 
we believe that these other policies either do not generally require us to make estimates and judgments that are as difficult or as subjective  or that it is less likely that they would have a material impact on our reported results of operations for a given period 
for additional information see note to the consolidated financial statements 
although we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  they are based upon information available at the end of each period and involve inherent risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ significantly from our estimates and our estimates could be different using different assumptions or conditions 
inventory reserves we establish inventory valuation reserves to reflect those conditions when the cost of the inventory is not expected to be recovered 
we review circumstances such as when products are not expected to be saleable 
the reserve recorded is equal to all or a portion of the cost of the inventory based on the specific facts and circumstances 
we monitor inventory levels on a regular basis and record increases in inventory valuation reserves in cost of sales and decreases in inventory valuation reserves when items are scrapped or disposed 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the inventory valuation reserve was increased by  as warranted by a higher level of slow moving geophysical equipment inventory precipitated by the industry wide slowdown in marine seismic exploration activity 
therefore  the inventory valuation reserve increased from  at june  to  at june  inventory valuation reserve balance and activity information is presented in schedule ii valuation and qualifying amounts for fiscal years  and deferred taxes we apply an asset and liability approach to accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the recoverability of deferred tax assets is dependent upon our assessment of whether it is more likely than not that sufficient future taxable income will be generated in the relevant tax jurisdiction to utilize the deferred tax asset 
we review our internal forecasted sales and pre tax earnings estimates to make our assessment about the utilization of deferred tax assets 
in the event we determine that future taxable income will not be sufficient to utilize the deferred tax asset  a valuation allowance is recorded 
if that assessment changes  a charge or a benefit would be recorded in the consolidated statement of income 
the company has concluded that no deferred tax valuation allowance was necessary at june  and because future taxable income is believed to be sufficient to utilize the deferred tax asset 
net deferred tax assets increased by  from  at june  to  at june  reflecting principally the tax benefit of the loss carry forward generated in the year ended june  and the increase in the inventory valuation reserve 
goodwill and intangible assets in connection with acquisitions  we determine the amounts and related useful lives assigned to goodwill and intangibles based on purchase price allocations 
these allocations  including an assessment of estimated useful lives  are performed utilizing the assistance of qualified independent appraisers using generally accepted valuation methodologies 
valuation of intangible assets  if any  is generally based on the estimated cash flows related to those assets  while the value assigned to goodwill is the residual of the purchase price over the fair value of all identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
useful lives are determined based on the expected future period of benefit of the asset  which considers various characteristics of the asset  including historical cash flows 
as required by sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the company reviews goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
goodwill was tested for impairment as of july   the initial test  as of july   the first annual test  and as of july   the next annual test 
all three tests were conducted by management with the assistance of an independent valuation company and the results of such tests indicated no impairment 
the company s goodwill carrying amounts relate solely to the acquisition of custom products and a g  which are two sfas reporting units 
bolt technology corporation bolt  the parent of custom products and a g  is a third reporting unit and has no goodwill 
both bolt and a g are in the geophysical equipment segment  and custom products is in the industrial products segment 
the company has no intangible assets other than goodwill on its balance sheet as of june  and recent accounting developments guarantees in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin addresses the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under guarantees 
specifically  fin requires that a liability be recorded in the guarantor s balance sheet upon the issuance of a guarantee and requires that certain disclosures be made concerning such guarantee 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of fin are effective on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december   irrespective of the guarantor s fiscal year end 
the disclosure requirements relating to fin are effective for either interim or annual financial statements periods ending after december  the adoption of fin did not have any impact on the company s consolidated financial statements because the company does not issue guarantees 
accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas 
this statement provides alternative methods of transition for an entity that voluntarily changes to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
sfas amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas to require prominent disclosure and in tabular format the effects on reported net income of an entity s accounting policy decisions concerning stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas requires disclosure of the pro forma effect of stock based employee compensation on reported net income in interim financial statements 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years ending after december  the interim disclosure requirements are effective for interim periods beginning after december  the company adopted sfas at the beginning of the third quarter of fiscal and that adoption did not have an impact on the company s consolidated results of operations or financial condition  since the company did not elect to change to the fair value method of accounting 
the company  however  has modified its reporting disclosures in the footnotes to the company s consolidated financial statements as required by the new standard 
variable interest entities in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin  which requires variable interest entities commonly referred to as spes to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the spe provided that certain criteria are met 
fin is effective immediately for all such entities created after or acquired after january  the adoption of fin did not have any impact on the company s consolidated financial statements since the company did not have any variable interest entities or spes as of june  and does not enter into such transactions 
derivative instruments and hedging activities in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
this statement amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments and hedging activities under fasb no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas is effective for derivative contracts entered into or modified after june  and for hedging relationships designated after june  all requirements of sfas are applied prospectively with certain exceptions 
we believe that the adoption of sfas will not have any impact on the company s results of operations or financial position because the company does not enter into any derivative instrument and hedging transactions 
accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas 
this statement establishes standards for how an issuer should classify and measure certain financial instruments having characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in certain cases 
prior to the issuance of sfas many issuers classified such instruments as equity 
sfas is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  sfas is to be implemented by reporting the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for financial instruments created before the issuance date of sfas and still existing as of the beginning of the interim period of adoption 
sfas does not provide for restatement 
the adoption of sfas did not have any impact on the company s consolidated financial statements because the company does not have any financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity
