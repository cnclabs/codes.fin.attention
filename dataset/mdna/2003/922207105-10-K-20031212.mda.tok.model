item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this annual report on form k contains certain forward looking statements 
for purposes of the safe harbor provisions under the private securities litigation reform act of  any statements using the terms 
table of contents believes  anticipates  expects  plans or similar expressions  are forward looking statements 
the forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected 
there are a number of important factors that could cause varian semiconductor s actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward looking statements made in this report and presented by management from time to time 
some of the important risks and uncertainties that may cause varian semiconductor s financial results to differ are described under the heading risk factors below 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and accounting estimates varian semiconductor s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon varian semiconductor s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires varian semiconductor to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on a continual basis  varian semiconductor evaluates its estimates  including those related to inventories  accounts receivable  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  post retirement benefits  contingencies  and functional currencies 
varian semiconductor operates in a highly cyclical and competitive industry that is influenced by a variety of diverse factors including  but not limited to  technological advances  product life cycles  customer and supplier lead times  and macroeconomic and geographic economic trends 
estimating product demand beyond a relatively short forecasting horizon is difficult and prone to forecasting error due to the cyclical nature and inherent lack of visibility in the industry 
varian semiconductor bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
see also the factors discussed below under the section titled risk factors 
varian semiconductor believes that the following sets forth the critical accounting policies used by varian semiconductor in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition product revenue includes established products  new products and spare parts 
varian semiconductor recognizes revenue from product sales upon shipment provided title and risk of loss has passed to the customer  evidence of an arrangement exists  fees are contractually fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured through historical collection results and regular credit evaluations  and there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance 
for established and new products  a portion of the total purchase price is typically not due until installation occurs and the customer accepts the product 
for established products  the lesser of the amount allocated to the equipment or the contractual amount due upon delivery is recorded as product revenue upon delivery 
the amount deferred is recognized as revenue upon customer acceptance of all material terms of the customer acceptance criteria 
for new products  revenue allocated to the equipment is recognized upon customer acceptance 
revenue related to spare parts and upgrade sales is recognized upon the later of delivery or when the title and risk of loss passes to the customer 
products are classified as established products if post delivery acceptance provisions and the installation process have been determined to be routine due to the fact that the acceptance provisions are generally a replication of pre shipment procedures and there is a demonstrated history of achieving predetermined installation cost targets 
the majority of products are designed and manufactured to meet contractual customer specifications 
to ensure customer specifications are satisfied  the systems are tested at varian semiconductor s manufacturing facility prior to shipment 
to the extent that customers conditions cannot be replicated in varian semiconductor s 
table of contents facilities or if there is not a demonstrated history of meeting newer customer specifications  then the product is treated as new for revenue recognition purposes 
varian semiconductor has predetermined criteria for changing the classification of a new product to an established product 
a new product must achieve a set number of acceptances and a set target for installation cost 
once the criteria have been achieved for a new product  the product is considered established 
service revenue includes revenue from maintenance and service contracts  paid service and installation services 
revenue related to maintenance and service contracts is recognized ratably over the duration of the contracts 
revenue related to paid service is recorded when earned and revenue related to installation is recorded upon fulfillment of the service obligation 
royalty and license revenue is recognized when contractual obligations are met  evidence of an arrangement exists  fees are fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
when fees are not fixed or determinable  revenue is recorded when payments become due 
varian semiconductor s transactions frequently include the sale of systems and services under multiple element arrangements 
revenue under these arrangements is allocated to all elements  except systems  based upon the fair market value of those elements 
the amount allocated to installation is based upon hourly rates at the estimated time to complete the service 
the fair value of all other elements is based upon the price charged when these amounts are sold separately and unaccompanied by other elements 
the amount of revenue allocated to systems is done on a residual method basis 
under this method  the total value of the arrangement is allocated first to the undelivered elements based on their fair values  with the remainder being allocated to systems revenue 
inventory and purchase order commitments varian semiconductor values its inventory at the lower of cost or market 
the determination of lower of cost or market requires that varian semiconductor make significant assumptions about future demand for products and the transition to new product offerings from legacy products 
estimating product demand beyond a relatively short forecasting horizon is difficult and prone to forecasting error due to the cyclical nature and inherent lack of visibility in the industry 
varian semiconductor also provides for losses on those open purchase order commitments in which varian semiconductor s estimated obligation to receive inventory under these commitments exceeds expected production demand 
these assumptions include  but are not limited to  future manufacturing schedules  customer demand  supplier lead time and technological and market obsolescence 
once inventory is written down and a new cost basis has been established  it is not written back up if demand increases 
if market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory provisions may be required 
if market conditions are more favorable than those projected by management  and specific products previously reserved against are subsequently sold  gross profit would improve by the amount of the specific reserve reversed in the quarter the product is sold 
in the case of purchase order commitments  more favorable market conditions or successful negotiations with suppliers will result in a reduction of provisions in the quarter the excess purchase order commitments are reduced 
allowance for doubtful accounts varian semiconductor maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments for products and services 
accounts with known financial issues are first reviewed and specific estimates are recorded 
the remaining accounts receivable balances are then grouped in categories by the amount of days the balance is past due and the estimated loss is calculated as a percentage of the total category based upon past history 
if the financial conditions of varian semiconductor s customers were to deteriorate resulting in their inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
if accounts previously identified as a risk and reserved for subsequently stabilize and are deemed to no longer be at risk for collection or categories past due decrease  the allowance for doubtful accounts may be reduced 
as a result  a reduction to bad debt expense would be recognized in the period the determination was made 

table of contents valuation allowance on deferred tax assets and income tax provision statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
on a quarterly basis  varian semiconductor evaluates both the positive and negative evidence bearing upon the realizability of its deferred tax assets 
varian semiconductor considers future taxable income  ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies  and the ability to utilize tax losses and credits in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
management has concluded that no valuation allowance is required at this time 
should varian semiconductor determine that it is not able to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets in the future  a valuation allowance would be required resulting in an expense recorded within the provision for income taxes line in the statement of income in the period in which such determination was made 
it is reasonably possible that the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable could be reduced in the near term if future taxable income is reduced 
varian semiconductor s effective tax rate is affected by levels of taxable income in domestic and foreign tax jurisdictions  us tax credits generated and utilized for research and development expenditures  us foreign income exclusion  investment tax credits and other tax incentives specific to domestic and foreign operations 
varian semiconductor  from time to time  is subject to various domestic and foreign tax audits pertaining to income tax filings for prior periods 
accordingly  foreign and domestic income tax payments could differ from previously recorded income tax provisions depending on the outcome of those audits 
product warranties varian semiconductor provides for the estimated cost of product warranties  the amount of which is based primarily upon historical information  at the time product revenue is recognized 
while varian semiconductor engages in extensive product quality programs and processes including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component supplies  varian semiconductor s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  utilization levels  material usage  service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure  and supplier warranties on parts delivered to varian semiconductor 
should actual product failure rates  utilization levels  material usage  service delivery costs or supplier warranties on parts differ from varian semiconductor s estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
environmental liabilities liabilities are recorded when environmental assessments and or remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
generally  the timing of these accruals coincides with completion of a feasibility study or varian semiconductor s commitment to a formal plan of action 
in situations where the various uncertainties make it difficult to assess the likelihood and scope of further investigation or remediation activities or to estimate then future costs  the lower limit of an estimated range is accrued on a non discounted basis 
all other liabilities  which are usually where varian semiconductor has generally sufficient knowledge to be able to better estimate the scope of costs and future activities  are accrued on a discounted basis 
should new information become available and or different assumptions be applied in the estimation of environmental liabilities  revisions to the accrued environmental liability would be required 
derivative financial instruments and forward exchange contracts as a multinational company  varian semiconductor faces exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
this exposure may change over time as varian semiconductor s business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on varian semiconductor s financial results 
historically  varian semiconductor s primary exposures have resulted from non us dollar denominated sales and purchases in europe and asia 
varian semiconductor does not enter into forward exchange contracts for trading purposes 
varian semiconductor s forward exchange contracts generally range from one to six months in original maturity 

table of contents results of operations fiscal year varian semiconductor s fiscal year is the or week period that ends on the friday nearest september fiscal year is comprised of the week period ended on october  fiscal year was comprised of the week period ended on september  fiscal year was comprised of the week period ended on september  industry varian semiconductor s business is highly cyclical and depends upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers  which in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits and products utilizing integrated circuits 
in the last three years  semiconductor equipment manufacturers have experienced a significant contraction in the demand for products due to the slowdown in economies worldwide  specifically the slowdown in technology sectors that utilize integrated circuits 
during fiscal year  demand for products and services in the semiconductor industry began to stabilize 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenue the following table sets forth total revenue and revenue by revenue stream for fiscal years and  including non recurring royalty and license revenue of million recognized during the first quarter of fiscal year received in connection with the settlement and license agreement with lam described in more detail below 
fiscal year change percent change amounts in millions product service royalty and license revenue product during fiscal year  demand for products began to stabilize with the increase in product revenue in fiscal year resulting from an increase in demand for mm single wafer ion implanters and more parts revenue compared to fiscal year service service revenue during fiscal year was million  compared to million for the same period a year ago 
there was a higher level of installation revenue due to a higher volume of shipments compared to the same period a year ago 
royalty pursuant to the terms of a settlement and license agreement between varian semiconductor and lam research corporation lam  varian semiconductor received  during the first quarter of fiscal year  a warrant to purchase  shares of lam common stock at per share and a million cash payment in exchange for prior use of certain varian semiconductor patents 
total royalty and license revenue recognized 
table of contents from lam during the first quarter of fiscal year includes the warrant  which was valued at million  and the million cash payment received 
lam continues to make quarterly cash payments of million  which are included in the royalty revenue in fiscal year lam is required to make quarterly cash payments of million through december for future use of the patents 
quarterly cash payments are recognized as royalty and license revenue in the period they become due 
see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue from varian semiconductor s ten largest customers  including the non recurring royalties in of million received from lam  in fiscal years   and accounted for approximately   and of revenue  respectively 
varian semiconductor expects that sales of its products to relatively few customers will continue to account for a high percentage of its revenue in the foreseeable future 
in fiscal year  revenue from two customers accounted for and of varian semiconductor s total revenue 
in fiscal year  revenue from two customers accounted for and of varian semiconductor s total revenue 
as of october   one customer accounted for of the total accounts receivable balance 
as of september   two customers  each representing or greater of the total accounts receivable balance  accounted for of the total accounts receivable balance 
revenue for the first quarter of fiscal year is currently estimated to exceed the million of revenue recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal year demand beyond the first quarter remains difficult to forecast  as visibility is limited by the cyclical nature of the industry 
fluctuations in the timing and mix of product shipments  customer requirements for systems  and the completion of the installation of the product will continue to have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue in any given period see also risk factors and critical accounting policies revenue recognition 
cost of product and service revenue 
cost of product revenue was million and gross margin was for fiscal year  compared to the cost of product revenue of million and gross margin of for fiscal year beginning in fiscal year and continuing into fiscal year  the semiconductor industry went into a sustained downturn  as evidenced by a decrease in quarterly revenue of million  or  between the first quarter of and the first quarter of during fiscal year  varian semiconductor recorded approximately million of supply chain and inventory related charges due to a substantial drop in orders and anticipated demand  primarily for legacy products  which resulted in varian semiconductor s inventory levels and outstanding purchase commitments exceeding anticipated demand for such products 
during fiscal year  demand for products began to stabilize  and customers began purchasing some legacy products and certain end of life products for which the inventory had been specifically reserved in previous years 
some of these sales were the result of unanticipated sales in emerging markets 
during fiscal year  varian semiconductor was able to improve factory operations and supply chain management and favorably negotiate settlements related to inventory commitments with selected vendors 
as a result of both the increase in demand  and improved management  these items favorably affected gross margin and pre tax income by million in fiscal year varian semiconductor has historically  and may in the future  sustain inventory related charges resulting from numerous factors  including changes in customers purchase commitments  changes in commitments to varian semiconductor vendors  technology changes and varian semiconductor s manufacturing lead times 
gross profit was favorably affected in fiscal year by million primarily due to engineering and product design enhancements that improved product warranty experience 
cost of service revenue was million and million for fiscal year and  respectively and gross margin was for both periods 
gross margin on total revenue for the first quarter of fiscal year is expected to be in the low to mid forties as a percentage of revenue 
research and development 
research and development expenses were million for fiscal year  compared to million for fiscal year  an increase of million  or 
the increase was a result of increased labor and material spending associated with the development of new products 
varian semiconductor continues to be committed to investment in product development  particularly the ongoing shift to mm single 
table of contents wafer implanters  factory automation  and the transition to advanced technology nodes 
varian semiconductor intends to continue its investment in research and development 
marketing  general and administrative 
marketing  general and administrative expenses were million for fiscal year  compared to million for fiscal year the decline in expenses was the result of a decrease in headcount and reductions in the cost of variable compensation programs partially offset by increased marketing expenses related to a higher level of field and factory demonstration costs 
varian semiconductor has continued to improve its accounts receivable collections experience 
as a result  million and million of customer accounts receivable were collected in fiscal year and  respectively  that were previously included in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
restructuring costs 
during october  varian semiconductor reduced its workforce  primarily in the us  by approximately employees 
varian semiconductor recognized approximately million in restructuring costs during the first quarter of fiscal year in september  in anticipation of continued soft demand for semiconductor devices and semiconductor capital equipment  varian semiconductor announced additional actions to restructure its business and reduce costs 
varian semiconductor recognized million in restructuring costs during the fourth quarter of fiscal year as a result of this restructuring  approximately employees were terminated worldwide prior to september  there were also charges associated with closing an office and relocating another office 
during fiscal year  varian semiconductor recognized approximately million in restructuring costs 
the restructuring costs related to a reduction in headcount of approximately employees and were severance related 
the majority of the restructuring reserve balance of million as of october  is expected to be paid by december below is a table summarizing the restructuring reserve activity in fiscal years and reduction in work force facility closures other total amounts in thousands balance as of september  new charges non cash items cash payments balance as of september  new charges cash payments balance as of october  interest income and interest expense 
during fiscal year  varian semiconductor earned million in net interest income  compared to million for fiscal year despite increased cash balances  net interest income decreased from the prior fiscal year due to lower short term interest rates and interest expense related to the debt assumed as part of the purchase of the facility in newburyport  massachusetts 
other loss income 
during fiscal year  varian semiconductor recorded a net loss in other income of million 
during fiscal year  varian semiconductor recorded a gain of million in other income to reflect the fair value accounting of the lam warrant 
see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents provision for income taxes 
varian semiconductor s effective income tax rate was in fiscal years and the rate is lower than the us federal statutory rate in fiscal years and principally due to credits and lower taxed foreign income 
future tax rates may vary from the historic rates depending on the worldwide composition of earnings and the continuing availability of income tax credits as well as the potential resolution of tax contingencies 
net income 
as a result of the foregoing factors  in fiscal year  varian semiconductor recorded net income of million  compared to net income of million for fiscal year the net income per diluted share was for fiscal year  compared to net income of per diluted share for fiscal year net income and net income per share for the first quarter of fiscal year are currently expected to equal or exceed the net income and net income per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal year fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenue 
the following table sets forth total revenue and revenue by revenue stream for fiscal years and  including non recurring royalty and license revenue of million recognized during the first quarter of fiscal year received in connection with the settlement and license agreement with lam described in more detail below 
fiscal year change percent change amounts in millions product service royalty and license revenue during fiscal year  the decrease in revenue was primarily a result of the downturn in the industry  specifically the reduction in capital expenditures by semiconductor manufacturers and the industry wide decline in demand for semiconductor devices 
pursuant to the terms of a settlement and license agreement between varian semiconductor and lam  varian semiconductor received  during the first quarter of fiscal year  a warrant to purchase  shares of lam common stock at per share and a million cash payment in exchange for prior use of certain varian semiconductor patents 
total royalty and license revenue recognized from lam during the first quarter of fiscal year includes the warrant  which was valued at million  and the million cash payment received 
lam made quarterly cash payments of million for the three remaining quarters of fiscal year and will continue to make quarterly cash payments of million through december for future use of the patents 
quarterly cash payments are recognized as royalty and license revenue in the period they become due 
see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
cost of product and service revenue 
cost of product revenue was million and gross margin was for fiscal year  compared to the cost of product revenue of million and gross margin of for fiscal year the decrease in gross margin of for fiscal year was primarily a result of a change in product mix and lower parts margins 
this was partially offset by lower warranty costs and improved inventory management 
during fiscal year  varian semiconductor recorded approximately million of supply chain and inventory related charges due to a substantial drop in orders and anticipated demand  primarily for legacy products  which resulted in varian semiconductor s inventory levels and outstanding purchase commitments exceeding anticipated demand for such products 
cost of service revenue was million and gross margin was for fiscal year  compared to the cost of service revenue of million and gross margin of for fiscal year the improvement in gross margin of for fiscal year was primarily a result of improvements in the system installation process resulting in reduced field costs and a reduction in overhead costs  both direct and indirect labor  due to lower headcount 

table of contents research and development 
research and development expenses were million for fiscal year  compared to million for fiscal year  an increase of million  or 
marketing  general and administrative 
marketing  general and administrative expenses were million for fiscal year  compared to million for fiscal year  a decrease of million or 
marketing  general and administrative expenses decreased from fiscal year to fiscal year mainly due to lower headcount throughout fiscal year  a decrease in commissions related to the lower revenues caused by the industry downturn and an improvement in its accounts receivable collections experience and the recovery of million of customer accounts receivable that were previously included in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
restructuring costs 
during october  varian semiconductor reduced its workforce  primarily in the us  by approximately employees 
varian semiconductor recognized approximately million in restructuring costs during the first quarter of fiscal year in september  in anticipation of continued soft demand for semiconductor devices and semiconductor capital equipment  varian semiconductor announced additional actions to restructure its business and reduce costs 
varian semiconductor recognized million in restructuring costs during the fourth quarter of fiscal year as a result of this restructuring  approximately employees were terminated worldwide prior to september  there were also charges associated with closing an office and relocating another office 
below is a table summarizing the restructuring reserve activity in fiscal year reduction in work force facility closures other total balance as of september  new charges non cash items cash payments balance as of september  interest income and interest expense 
during fiscal year  varian semiconductor earned million in net interest income as compared with million for fiscal year despite increased cash balances  net interest income decreased from the prior fiscal year due to lower short term interest rates 
other income 
varian semiconductor received a warrant to purchase shares of lam common stock on december  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the warrant was treated as a derivative and was remeasured at fair value at each balance sheet date 
under fair value accounting  all gains and losses were reported in other income expense 
the volatility in lam s stock price and other factors resulted in changes to the fair value of the lam warrant 
as a result  varian semiconductor recorded a gain of million in other income to reflect the fair value accounting of the lam warrant 
on april   varian semiconductor completed the sale of this warrant to an unrelated third party for million in cash 
provision for income taxes 
varian semiconductor s effective income tax rate was in fiscal years and the rate is lower than the us federal statutory rate principally due to tax benefits arising from the use of credits and low taxed foreign income in  and tax benefits arising from the use of the extraterritorial income exclusion and tax credits in cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of tax 
varian semiconductor reported a change in accounting principle for the adoption of sab in accordance with apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  by a cumulative effect adjustment 
varian semiconductor recorded a non cash charge of million after reduction for income taxes of million  or per diluted share  to reflect the cumulative effect of the accounting change as of the beginning of the fiscal year 
table of contents net income 
as a result of the foregoing factors  in fiscal year varian semiconductor recorded net income of million  compared to net income of million for fiscal year the net income per diluted share was for fiscal year  compared to net income of per diluted share for fiscal year liquidity and capital resources varian semiconductor generated million of cash from operations during fiscal year  compared to million during fiscal year cash provided by operations in fiscal year was derived primarily from the decreases in accounts receivable of million  inventories of million and net income of million 
these decreases and net income were partially offset by a decrease in deferred revenue of million and a decrease in accrued expenses of million 
in fiscal year  cash provided by operations was primarily a result of a decrease in inventory of million  in addition to net income of million 
these increases to cash during fiscal year were partially offset by non cash considerations of million in royalty and license income and a decrease in deferred revenue of million 
varian semiconductor used million for the net purchase of short term investments during fiscal year in february  varian semiconductor purchased its facility located in newburyport  massachusetts from its lessor for approximately million  using approximately million of cash 
as part of this purchase  varian semiconductor assumed the seller s outstanding loan on the property of approximately million 
overall  varian semiconductor used million and million of cash for the purchase of property  plant and equipment during fiscal years ended october  and september   respectively 
cash provided by investing activities for the fiscal year ended september  included million that was generated from the sale of the lam warrant on april  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
during fiscal year  varian semiconductor generated million of cash from financing activities  primarily due to million from the issuance of stock upon the exercise of stock options and under the employee stock purchase plan  offset by repayments on short and long term borrowings 
during fiscal year  million of cash was generated by financing activities  primarily due to million from the issuance of stock upon the exercise of stock options 
this was partially offset by repayments of short term borrowings of million 
varian semiconductor has an agreement with two banks to sell specific receivables  subject to recourse provisions 
there were no receivables sold under these arrangements during fiscal year during fiscal year and  approximately million and million  respectively  of receivables were sold under these arrangements 
as of october   no receivables sold to the bank were outstanding 
as of september   approximately million of receivables sold to the bank remained outstanding 
varian semiconductor has not recorded any asset or liability in connection with these agreements 
varian semiconductor does not believe it is materially at risk for any losses as a result of this agreement 
varian semiconductor s liquidity is affected by many factors  some based on the normal operations of the business and others related to the uncertainties of the industry and global economies 
varian semiconductor believes that cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million at october  will be sufficient to satisfy working capital requirements  commitments for capital expenditures and other purchase commitments  environmental contingencies and cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
off balance sheet arrangements varian semiconductor does not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  varian semiconductor is not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if varian semiconductor had engaged in such relationships
