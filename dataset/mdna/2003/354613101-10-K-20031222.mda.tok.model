item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements in this section  we discuss our results of operations and our financial condition 
in addition to historical information  we also make some statements relating to the future  which are called forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements involve a number of risks  uncertainties and other important factors that could cause our actual results and outcomes to differ materially from any future results or outcomes expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
for this reason  you should not rely too heavily on them and should review the risk factors section  where we discuss these statements in more detail 
general we derive the majority of our operating revenues  operating expenses and net income from providing investment advisory and related services to retail mutual funds  institutional  high net worth  private accounts and other investment products 
this is our primary business activity and operating segment 
the mutual funds and other products that we advise  collectively called our sponsored investment products  are distributed to the public globally under five distinct names franklin templeton mutual series bissett fiduciary trust our sponsored investment products include a broad range of global international equity  us domestic  hybrid balanced  fixed income and money market mutual funds  as well as other investment products that meet a wide variety of specific investment needs of individuals and institutions 
the level of our revenues depends largely on the level and relative mix of assets under management 
to a lesser degree  our revenues also depend on the level of mutual fund sales and the number of mutual fund shareholder accounts 
the fees charged for our services are based on contracts with our sponsored investment products or our clients 
these arrangements could change in the future 
our secondary business and operating segment is banking finance 
our banking finance group offers selected retail banking services to high net worth individuals  foundations and institutions  and consumer lending services 
our consumer lending activities include automotive lending related to the purchase  securitization  and servicing of retail installment sales contracts originated by independent automobile dealerships  consumer credit and debit cards  real estate equity lines  and home equity mortgage loans 
results of operations the table below presents the highlights of our operations for the last three fiscal years 
in millions except per share amounts for the years ended september  vs vs net income earnings per common share basic diluted operating margin net income increased by and diluted earnings per share increased by in fiscal the increase was primarily due to higher operating revenues consistent with a increase in our simple monthly average assets under management  higher gross sales  and an increase in billable shareholder accounts  as well as higher investment and other income in fiscal due to an other than temporary decline in the value of certain investments in fiscal these increases were partially offset by higher underwriting and distribution expenses and a higher effective tax rate in fiscal as compared to the prior year 
an increase in repurchases of our stock  resulting in a decline in diluted weighted average shares outstanding from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  also contributed to the increase in diluted earnings per common share 
net income decreased by and diluted earnings per share decreased by in fiscal primarily due to lower investment and other income related to an other than temporary decline in the value of certain investments and increased operating expenses  partially offset by higher revenues 
assets under management in billions as of the years ended september  vs vs equity global international domestic us total equity hybrid balanced fixed income tax free taxable domestic us global international total fixed income money market total simple monthly average for the year investment management fees from approximately of our assets under management at september  were calculated using daily average assets under management 
our assets under management at september  were billion  higher than they were a year ago  due to excess sales over redemptions net inflows of billion and market appreciation of billion  primarily in the latter half of fiscal simple monthly average assets under management  which are generally more indicative of investment management fee revenue trends than the year over year change in ending assets under management  increased during fiscal the simple monthly average mix of assets under management for the last three fiscal years is shown below 
as of the years ended september  percentage of simple monthly average assets under management equity fixed income hybrid balanced money market total the following table presents industry data showing average effective investment management fee rates for the years ended september   and the data was obtained from lipper r inc and our actual effective fee rates may vary from these rates

industry effective fee rates reflect the investment management expenses of retail and institutional funds drawn from all distribution channels  without exception 
the averages reflect combined retail and institutional funds data and include all share classes  and all distribution channels  without exception 
variable annuities are not included 
for the fiscal year  our effective investment management fee rate investment management fees divided by simple monthly average assets under management declined to from in fiscal the change in the mix of assets under management  resulting from higher relative net inflows and appreciation for fixed income as compared to equity products  led to the slight decrease in the effective investment management fee rate 
generally  fixed income and hybrid balanced products carry a lower management fee than equity assets 
the decline in the effective management fee rate to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal was largely due to the inclusion of the assets under management of fiduciary trust company international fiduciary trust beginning in fiscal and market depreciation in equity assets in fiscal approximately of fiduciary trust s assets under management were classified as hybrid balanced assets at the time of acquisition in april assets under management by shareholder location were as follows in billions as of the year ended september  united states canada europe asia pacific and other total investors in the united states owned approximately of our assets under management at september  and approximately of our revenues originated in the united states in fiscal investment advisory and administrative services related to these assets may be provided in jurisdictions outside the united states in accordance with contractual arrangements with our sponsored investment products 
components of the change in our assets under management were as follows in billions as of and for the years ended september  vs vs beginning assets under management sales reinvested dividends redemptions distributions acquisitions appreciation depreciation n a ending assets under management during fiscal and  our sponsored investment products experienced overall net inflows in contrast to the slight net outflows experienced in fiscal gross product sales increased while redemptions increased in our acquisition of pioneer iti amc limited pioneer  an indian investment management company  in july increased our assets under management by billion as of the date of this acquisition 
in  the acquisition of bissett and associates investment management ltd 
bissett  in october  increased our assets under management by billion  and the fiduciary trust acquisition  in april  increased our assets under management by billion  as of the dates of those acquisitions 
our products experienced billion in appreciation in fiscal as compared to market depreciation in both fiscal and consistent with an overall increase in domestic and global equity markets in the latter half of operating revenues the table below presents the percentage change in each revenue category between fiscal and fiscal and between fiscal and fiscal percentage of total revenues vs vs investment management fees underwriting and distribution fees shareholder servicing fees consolidated sponsored investment products income  net n a n a other  net total operating revenues summary in fiscal  total operating revenues increased over the prior year due to increased investment management  shareholder servicing and underwriting and distribution fees  consistent with a increase in simple monthly average assets under management  an increase in billable shareholder accounts and higher gross product sales 
in fiscal  total operating revenues increased over the prior year 
investment management and underwriting and distribution fees increased due to higher net sales and higher average assets under management 
other  net revenue increased due to the inclusion of fiduciary trust revenues for a full fiscal year in  as well as higher net gains related to auto loan securitizations included in other  net revenue 
investment management fees investment management fees  accounting for of our operating revenues in fiscal  include both investment advisory and administration fees 
these fees are generally calculated under contractual arrangements with our sponsored investment products as a percentage of the market value of assets under management 
annual rates vary by investment objective and type of services provided 
in return for these fees  we provide a combination of investment advisory  administrative and other management services 
investment management fees increased in fiscal consistent with a increase in simple monthly average assets under management  partially offset by a slight decline in our effective investment management fee rate resulting from a shift in average asset mix toward fixed income products  which generally carry a lower management fee than equity assets 
investment management fees increased in fiscal primarily due to increased net sales  which increased assets under management  and the impact of including fiduciary trust for a full fiscal year 
this increase was partially offset by a shift in our average asset mix toward fixed income investment products  which led to a decrease in our effective investment management fee rate 
underwriting and distribution fees we earn underwriting fees from the sale of some classes of sponsored investment products on which investors pay a sales commission at the time of purchase 
sales commissions are reduced or eliminated on some classes of shares and for sales to shareholders or intermediaries that exceed specified minimum amounts 
therefore  underwriting fees will change with the overall level of gross sales and the relative mix of sales between different share classes 
many of our sponsored investment products pay distribution fees in return for sales  marketing and distribution efforts on their behalf 
while other contractual arrangements exist in international jurisdictions  in the united states  distribution fees include b fees 
these fees are subject to maximum payout levels based on a percentage of the assets in each fund and other regulatory limitations 
we pay a significant portion of underwriting and distribution fees to the financial advisors and other intermediaries who sell our sponsored investment products to the public on our behalf 
see the description of underwriting and distribution expenses below 
overall  underwriting and distribution fees increased in fiscal underwriting fees increased primarily due to a increase in gross product sales  partially offset by a change in the sales mix 
distribution fees increased consistent with a increase in simple monthly average assets under management and a change in the asset mix 
underwriting and distribution fees increased in fiscal underwriting fees increased consistent with a increase in gross product sales  and distribution fees increased consistent with an increase in simple monthly average assets under management 
shareholder servicing fees shareholder servicing fees are generally fixed charges per shareholder account that vary with the particular type of fund and the service being rendered 
in some instances  sponsored investment products are charged these fees based on the level of assets under management 
we receive fees as compensation for providing transfer agency services  including providing customer statements  transaction processing  customer service and tax reporting 
in the united states  transfer agency service agreements provide that accounts closed in a calendar year remain billable through the second quarter of the following calendar year at a reduced rate 
in canada  such agreements provide that accounts closed in the calendar year remain billable for four months after the end of the calendar year 
accordingly  the level of fees will vary with the growth in new accounts and the level of closed accounts that remain billable 
shareholder servicing fees increased in fiscal the increase reflects an increase in the overall number of billable shareholder accounts  partially offset by a decline in fee rates chargeable on accounts closed in the prior calendar year  under revised shareholder service fee agreements in the united states that became effective on january  the million shareholder accounts added in july as a result of the acquisition of pioneer also contributed to the increase in average billable accounts in fiscal shareholder servicing fees decreased in fiscal consistent with a decrease in the quarterly average number of billable accounts 
other  net other  net consists primarily of revenues from the banking finance operating segment as well as income from custody services 
revenues from the banking finance operating segment include interest income on loans  servicing income  and investment income on banking finance investment securities  and are reduced by interest expense and the provision for probable loan losses 
other  net increased in fiscal as a result of higher net interest income and auto loan servicing income  partially offset by lower custody fees 
other  net increased in fiscal primarily due to the inclusion of fiduciary trust s banking and custody activities for a full fiscal year in and increased gains recognized on auto loan portfolio sales 
operating expenses the table below presents the percentage change in each expense category between fiscal and fiscal and between fiscal and fiscal percentage of total expenses vs vs underwriting and distribution compensation and benefits information systems  technology and occupancy advertising and promotion amortization of deferred sales commissions amortization of intangible assets september  recovery expense  net n a other total operating expenses summary operating expenses increased during fiscal primarily due to higher underwriting and distribution and other expenses  which were partly offset by lower advertising and promotion  and information systems  technology and occupancy costs 
operating expenses increased during fiscal this increase was primarily due to increased underwriting and distribution fees consistent with higher underwriting and distribution revenue  and higher compensation and benefits and technology and occupancy costs primarily due to the inclusion of fiduciary trust s activity for a full fiscal year in the increase in these expense categories was offset in part by a decline in amortization of intangible assets on discontinuation of the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
underwriting and distribution underwriting and distribution includes expenses paid to financial advisers and other third parties for selling  distributing and providing ongoing services to investors in our sponsored investment products 
underwriting and distribution expenses increased in fiscal and in fiscal consistent with similar trends in underwriting and distribution revenues 
compensation and benefits compensation and benefits increased during fiscal although we experienced a decrease in retention bonus commitments related to the acquisition of fiduciary trust  we have also experienced increases in employee insurance and other benefits costs in fiscal we employed approximately  people at september  compared to approximately  at the same time last year 
in order to hire and retain key employees  we are committed to keeping our salaries and benefit packages competitive  which means that the level of compensation and benefits may increase more quickly or decrease more slowly than our revenues 
compensation and benefits increased during fiscal this increase was primarily due to the inclusion of fiduciary trust s activity for a full fiscal year  partially offset by an overall decline in employees as well as the decision made by management during the quarter ended december to reduce employee salaries by or  depending on specific salary categories 
in may  we reinstated salaries for employees whose salaries were reduced by and  in july  we reinstated employee salaries in the reduction category 
information systems  technology and occupancy information systems  technology and occupancy costs decreased in fiscal this decrease was primarily due to decreased purchases of information system and technology equipment leading to decreased depreciation certain of our technology equipment is periodically replaced with new equipment under our technology outsourcing agreement and lower expenditures on technology projects 
while continuing to work on new technology initiatives and investment in our technology infrastructure  we have slowed down a number of initiatives and delayed the start of other technology projects given the recent economic slowdown and our focus on cost control and management 
information systems  technology and occupancy costs increased in fiscal this increase was primarily due to the inclusion of costs related to the outsourcing of the management of our data center and distributed server operations and added technology and occupancy costs of the fiduciary trust acquisition for a full fiscal year in details of capitalized information systems and technology costs for the last three fiscal years were as follows in thousands net carrying amount at beginning of period    additions during period  net of disposals and other adjustments    net assets purchased through acquisitions  amortization during period    net carrying amount at end of period    advertising and promotion advertising and promotion decreased during fiscal and increased in fiscal during fiscal we incurred higher promotion and advertising costs to educate the sales channels and the investing public about the strong relative investment performance of our sponsored investment products 
we are committed to investing in advertising and promotion in response to changing business conditions  which means that the level of advertising and promotion expenditures may increase more rapidly or decrease more slowly than our revenues 
amortization of deferred sales commissions certain fund share classes  including class b  are sold without a front end sales charge to shareholders  although our distribution subsidiaries pay a commission on the sale 
in the united states  class a shares are sold without a front end sales charge to shareholders when minimum investment criteria are met 
however  our us distribution subsidiary pays a commission on these sales 
class c shares are sold with a front end sales charge that is lower than the commission paid by the us distributor 
we defer and amortize all up front commissions paid by our distribution subsidiaries over months to years depending on share class or financing arrangements 
we have arranged to finance our class b and c deferred commission assets dca arising from our us  canadian and european operations through lightning finance company limited lfl  a company in which we have a ownership interest 
in the united states  lfl has entered into a financing agreement with our us distribution subsidiary and we maintain a continuing interest in the assets until resold by lfl 
as a result  we retain dca sold to lfl under the us agreement in our financial statements and amortize them over an year period  or until sold by lfl to third parties 
in contrast to the us arrangement  lfl has entered into direct agreements with our canadian and european sponsored investment products  and  as a result  we do not record dca from these sources in our financial statements 
amortization of deferred sales commissions increased in fiscal from the prior year primarily due to increased gross product sales and because lfl did not sell any us dca in a securitization transaction in fiscal  while it sold approximately million us dca in fiscal amortization of deferred sales commissions decreased in fiscal  due to changes in sales mix and existing financing arrangements 
amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets decreased in fiscal  primarily due to foreign currency movements 
amortization of intangible assets decreased in fiscal due to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  on october  under sfas  we ceased to amortize goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
this resulted in a reduction in amortization expense of approximately million in fiscal as compared to the prior year 
as of march   we completed our most recent annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite lived and definite lived intangible assets and we determined that there was no impairment to these assets as of october  other income expense other income expense includes investment and other income and interest expense 
beginning july   realized and unrealized gains losses  net  of sponsored investment products that were consolidated in our financial statements on adoption of the financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin  are also included in this classification 
see the description of fin in critical accounting policies below 
investment and other income is comprised primarily of the following dividends from investments interest income from investments in bonds and government securities realized gains and losses on investments foreign currency exchange gains and losses miscellaneous income  including gain or loss on disposal of property 
net other income was million in fiscal as compared to a net expense of million in fiscal due to a million other than temporary decline in value of some of our investments recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal net other income was million in fiscal due to net realized gains of approximately million on the sale of certain sponsored investment products held for investment purposes and other realized gains of million related to the sale of our former headquarters building in san mateo 
taxes on income as a multi national corporation  we provide investment management services to a wide range of international investment products  often managed from locations outside the united states 
some of these jurisdictions have lower tax rates than the united states 
the mix of income primarily investment management fees subject to these lower rates  when aggregated with income originating in the united states  produces a lower overall effective tax rate than existing us federal and state tax rates 
our effective income tax rate for fiscal increased to compared to in fiscal and in fiscal the effective tax rate will continue to reflect the relative contributions of foreign earnings that are subject to reduced tax rates and that are not currently included in us taxable income  as well as other factors 
material changes in financial condition  liquidity and capital resources at september   we had  million in cash and cash equivalents  as compared to million at september  cash and cash equivalents include cash  us treasury bills and other debt instruments with maturities of three months or less from the purchase date and other highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash  including money market funds 
liquid assets  which consist of cash and cash equivalents  investments available for sale and current receivables  increased to  million at september  from  million at september  liquid assets have increased in fiscal primarily due to cash provided by operating activities  proceeds received from auto loan securitizations and the issuance of medium term notes  offset in part by common stock repurchases and loan origination activity 
outstanding debt  including federal home loan bank advances and current maturities of long term debt  increased to  million at september   compared to million at september  the balance at september  included million in principal and accrued interest related to outstanding convertible notes  million in five year senior notes and million in other long term debt  including current maturities 
other long term debt consisted primarily of deferred commission liabilities recognized in relation to us dca financed by lfl that had not yet been sold by lfl in a securitization transaction see note to the consolidated financial statements for a further description of debt outstanding 
each of the  principal amount at maturity convertible notes is convertible into shares of our common stock 
we may redeem the convertible notes for cash on or after may  at their accreted value 
on may   at the option of the holders  we repurchased convertible notes with a face value of million principal amount at maturity  for million in cash  the accreted value of the notes as of may  we may have to repurchase the convertible notes at their accreted value  at the option of the holders  on may of     and in this event  we may choose to pay the purchase price in cash or shares of our common stock 
the amount of convertible notes that will be redeemed depends on  among other factors  the performance of our common stock 
as of september   outstanding debt included million related to the convertible notes and million of other long term debt  including current maturities 
the increase in outstanding debt from september  is primarily due to the issuance of the five year senior notes in april  the increase in us dca financed by lfl  and the accretion of interest on the convertible notes 
as of september   we had million of commercial paper and million of debt and equity securities available to be issued under shelf registration statements filed with the securities and exchange commission 
our committed revolving credit facilities at september  totaled million  of which  million was under a day facility 
the remaining million facility is under a five year facility that will expire in june in addition  at september   our banking finance operating segment had million in available uncommitted short term bank lines under the federal reserve funds system  the federal reserve bank discount window  and federal home loan bank short term borrowing capacity 
our ability to access the capital markets in a timely manner depends on a number of factors including our credit rating  the condition of the global economy  investors willingness to purchase our securities  interest rates  credit spreads and the valuation levels of equity markets 
in extreme circumstances  we might not be able to access this liquidity readily 
our banking finance operating segment periodically enters into auto loan securitization transactions with qualified special purpose entities  which then issue asset backed securities to private investors 
gross sale proceeds from these transactions were million in fiscal and million in fiscal the outstanding loan balances held by these special purpose entities were million as of september  and million as of september  our ability to access the securitization market will directly affect our plans to finance the auto loan portfolio in the future 
the sales commissions that we have financed globally through lfl during fiscal  were approximately million compared to million in fiscal lfl s ability to access credit facilities and the securitization market will directly affect our existing financing arrangements 
we expect that the main uses of cash will be to expand our core business make strategic acquisitions acquire shares of our common stock fund property and equipment purchases pay operating expenses of the business enhance our technology infrastructure improve our business processes pay shareholder dividends repay and service debt 
we believe that we can meet our present and reasonably foreseeable operating cash needs and future commitments through the following existing liquid assets continuing cash flow from operations borrowing capacity under current credit facilities ability to issue debt or equity securities mutual fund sales commission financing arrangement 
in particular  we expect to finance future investment in our banking finance activities through operating cash flows  debt  increased deposit base  or through the securitization of a portion of the receivables from consumer lending activities 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments our contractual cash obligations and commitments as of september  were as follows payments due by period less more in thousands total than than year years years years long term debt obligations      operating lease obligations      in addition  at september   the banking finance operating segment had commitments to extend credit aggregating million  primarily under its credit card lines and had issued financial standby letters of credit totaling million on which beneficiaries would be able to draw upon in the event of non performance by our customers  primarily in relation to lease and lien obligations of these banking customers 
these standby letters of credit  issued prior to january   were secured by marketable securities with a fair value of million as of september  and commercial real estate 
off balance sheet arrangements as discussed above  we obtain financing for sales commissions that we pay to brokers on class b and c shares through lfl  a company incorporated in ireland whose sole business purpose is to finance our dca 
we hold a ownership interest in lfl and we account for this ownership interest using the equity method of accounting 
our exposure to loss related to our investment in lfl is limited to the carrying value of our investment and loans  and interest and fees receivable from lfl 
at september   those amounts approximated million 
during fiscal  we financed approximately million of sales commissions through lfl and we recognized pre tax income of approximately million for our share of the net income of lfl 
as discussed above  our banking finance operating segment periodically enters into auto loan securitization transactions with qualified special purpose entities  which then issue asset backed securities to private investors 
our main objective in entering in securitization transactions is to obtain financing for auto loan activities 
securitized loans held by the securitization trusts totaled million at september  and million at september  in relation to these transactions  we are obligated to cover shortfalls in amounts due to the holders of the notes up to certain levels as specified under the related agreements 
as of september   the maximum potential amount of future payments was million relating to guarantees made prior to january  in addition  our consolidated balance sheet at september  included a million liability to reflect obligations arising from an auto securitization transaction that we entered into in june we are contingently liable for approximately million in residual guarantees under an operating lease for our global corporate headquarters campus in san mateo  california 
this represents about of the total construction costs of million 
we are also contingently liable to purchase the corporate headquarters campus for an amount equal to the final construction costs of million if an event of default occurs under the agreement 
an event of default includes  but is not limited to  failure to make lease payments when due and failure to maintain required insurance 
management considers the possibility of default under the provisions of the agreement to be remote 
currently  the lease is treated as an operating lease  as none of the capitalization criteria under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for leases  were met at the inception of the lease 
we anticipate that we will consolidate our corporate headquarters campus under the requirements of fin in the period ending december  critical accounting policies our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that impact our financial position and results of operations 
these estimates and assumptions are affected by our application of accounting policies 
below we describe certain critical accounting policies that we believe are important to understanding our results of operations and financial position 
in addition  please refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our accounting policies 
intangible assets at september  our assets included intangible assets as follows in thousands net carrying amount goodwill  intangible assets definite lived  intangible assets indefinite lived  total  under sfas  we are required to test the fair value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles when there is an indication of impairment  or at least once a year 
as of march   we completed our annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite lived and definite lived intangible assets and we determined that there was no impairment to these assets as of october  the fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets is determined based on anticipated discounted cash flows 
goodwill is impaired when the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the reporting unit 
in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit  we use valuation techniques based on discounted cash flows similar to models employed in analyzing the purchase price of an acquisition target 
intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment at each reporting period on the basis of the expected future undiscounted operating cash flows  without interest charges  to be derived from these assets 
in performing our analysis  we used certain assumptions and estimates including those related to discount rates and the expected future period of cash flows to be derived from the assets  based on  among other factors  historical trends and the characteristics of the assets 
while we believe that our testing was appropriate  if these estimates and assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges or otherwise increase amortization expense 
income taxes as a multinational corporation  we operate in various locations outside the united states 
we have not made a provision for us taxes on the cumulative undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as those earnings are intended to be reinvested for an indefinite period of time 
these earnings approximated billion at september  changes to our policy of reinvesting foreign earnings may have a significant effect on our financial condition and results of operation 
valuation of investments we record substantially all investments in our financial statements at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value 
where available  we use prices from independent sources such as listed market prices or broker or dealer price quotations 
for investments in illiquid and privately held securities that do not have readily determinable fair values  we estimate the value of the securities based upon available information 
however  even where the value of a security is derived from an independent market price or broker or dealer quote  some assumptions may be required to determine the fair value 
for example  we generally assume that the size of positions in securities that we hold would not be large enough to affect the quoted price of the securities when sold  and that any such sale would happen in an orderly manner 
however  these assumptions may be incorrect and the actual value realized on sale could differ from the current carrying value 
we evaluate our investments for other than temporary decline in value on a periodic basis 
this may exist when the fair value of an investment security has been below the current value for an extended period of time 
as most of our investments are carried at fair value  if an other than temporary decline in value is determined to exist  the unrealized investment loss recorded net of tax in accumulated other comprehensive income is realized as a charge to net income  in the period in which the other than temporary decline in value is determined 
in fiscal  we recognized million for an other than temporary decline in the value of certain investments 
while we believe that we have accurately estimated the amount of other than temporary decline in value in our portfolio  different assumptions could result in changes to the recorded amounts in our financial statements 
loss contingencies we are involved in various lawsuits and claims encountered in the normal course of business 
when such a matter arises and periodically thereafter  we consult with our legal counsel and evaluate the merits of the claim based on the facts available at that time 
in management s opinion  an adequate accrual has been made as of september  to provide for any probable losses that may arise from these matters 
variable interest entities fin  issued in january  requires consolidation of a variable interest entity vie by the enterprise that has the majority of the risks or rewards of ownership  referred to as the primary beneficiary 
the consolidation and disclosure provisions of fin are effective immediately for vies created after january   and  originally  for interim or annual reporting periods beginning after june  for vies created before february  however  in october  the fasb issued staff position fin  effective date of fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fsp fin  deferring the consolidation provisions of fin to interim or annual reporting periods ending after december  for vies created before february  six vies  all sponsored investment products with inception dates after january   have been consolidated in our financial statements at september  the effect of this consolidation was to increase our consolidated net income by million and our financial position by million for and as of the year ended september  our exposure to loss related to our investment in these consolidated vies is limited to our investment and fees earned  but not yet received  totaling million at september  we are continuing our evaluation of sponsored investment products and will adopt the consolidation provisions of fin for products created before february  in the quarter ending december   in accordance with fsp fin based on the current requirements of fin  we estimate that the effect of adoption on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  will be to increase assets by approximately  million  based on september  values 
our exposure to loss as a result of our investment in these vies is limited to our investment  totaling million at september   and fees earned but not yet received 
in addition  as the primary beneficiary of our corporate headquarters campus  a lessor trust  we anticipate that we will consolidate the trust under the provisions of fin as of december  the impact of consolidating the trust will be to increase property and equipment  net by approximately million and current maturities of long term debt  by approximately million as of this date 
in relation to our purchase of darby overseas investments  ltd 
and darby overseas  lp  we anticipate that we will consolidate sponsored investment products with total assets of approximately million as of october  evaluating whether related entities are vies and determining whether we qualify as the primary beneficiary of these vies  is highly complex and involves the use of estimates and assumptions 
in general  when we estimate the expected residual returns of a vie based on discounted cash flows  we make certain assumptions about discount rates 
in addition  we determine the volatility of the vie s expected returns based on available historical information and management s estimates 
while we believe that our testing and approach were appropriate  future changes in estimates and assumptions may affect our decision to consolidate one or more vies in our financial statements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional fin disclosures

we compete with numerous investment management companies  stock brokerage and investment banking firms  insurance companies  banks  savings and loan associations and other financial institutions 
continuing consolidation in the financial services industry has created stronger competitors with greater financial resources and broader distribution channels than our own 
additionally  competing securities dealers whom we rely upon to distribute our mutual funds also sell their own proprietary funds and investment products  which could limit the distribution of our investment products 
to the extent that existing or potential customers  including securities dealers  decide to invest in or distribute the products of our competitors  the sales of our products as well as our market share  revenues and net income could decline 
changes in the distribution channels on which we depend could reduce our revenues and hinder our growth 
we derive nearly all of our fund sales through broker dealers and other similar investment advisors 
increasing competition for these distribution channels has caused our distribution costs to rise and could cause further increases in the future 
higher distribution costs lower our net revenues and earnings 
additionally  if one of the major financial advisors who distribute our products were to cease their operations  it could have a significant adverse impact on our revenues and earnings 
moreover  our failure to maintain strong business relationships with these advisors would impair our ability to distribute and sell our products  which would have a negative effect on our level of assets under management  related revenues and overall business and financial condition 
we have become subject to an increased risk of asset volatility from changes in the global equity markets 
we have become subject to an increased risk of asset volatility from changes in the domestic and global financial and equity markets due to the continuing threat of terrorism 
declines in these markets have caused in the past  and would cause in the future  a decline in our revenue and income 
the levels of our assets under management  which in turn impact revenues  are subject to significant fluctuations 
global economic conditions  changes in the equity market place  interest rates  inflation rates  the yield curve and other factors that are difficult to predict affect the mix  market values and levels of our assets under management 
changing market conditions may cause a shift in our asset mix towards fixed income products and a related decline in our revenue and income  since we generally derive higher fee revenues and income from equity assets than from fixed income products we manage 
similarly  our securitized consumer receivables business is subject to marketplace fluctuation 
we face risks associated with conducting operations in numerous foreign countries 
we sell mutual funds and offer investment advisory and related services in many different regulatory jurisdictions around the world  and intend to continue to expand our operations internationally 
regulators in these jurisdictions could change their policies or laws in a manner that might restrict or otherwise impede our ability to distribute or register investment products in their respective markets 
our ability to successfully integrate the widely varied segments of our business can be impeded by systems and other technological limitations 
our continued success in effectively managing and growing our business both domestically and abroad  depends on our ability to integrate the varied accounting  financial  information and operational systems of our various businesses on a global basis 
our inability to meet cash needs could have a negative effect on our financial condition and business operations 
our ability to meet anticipated cash needs depends upon factors including our asset value  our creditworthiness as perceived by lenders and the market value of our stock 
similarly  our ability to securitize and hedge future loan portfolios and credit card receivables  and to obtain continued financing for class b and c shares  is also subject to the market s perception of those assets  finance rates offered by competitors  and the general market for private debt 
if we are unable to obtain these funds and financing  we may be forced to incur unanticipated costs or revise our business plans 
certain of the portfolios we manage including our emerging market portfolios and related revenues are vulnerable to market specific political or economic risks 
our emerging market portfolios and revenues derived from managing these portfolios are subject to significant risks of loss from political and diplomatic developments  currency fluctuations  social instability  changes in governmental polices  expropriation  nationalization  asset confiscation and changes in legislation related to foreign ownership 
foreign trading markets  particularly in some emerging market countries are often smaller  less liquid  less regulated and significantly more volatile than the us and other established markets 
diverse and strong competition limits the interest rates that we can charge on consumer loans 
we compete with many types of institutions for consumer loans  which can provide loans at significantly below market interest rates in connection with automobile sales or in some cases zero interest rates 
our inability to compete effectively against these companies or to maintain our relationships with the various automobile dealers through whom we offer consumer loans could limit the growth of our consumer loan business 
economic and credit market downturns could reduce the ability of our customers to repay loans  which could cause our consumer loan portfolio losses to increase 
we are subject to federal reserve board regulation 
upon completion of our acquisition of fiduciary trust in april  we became a bank holding company and a financial holding company subject to the supervision and regulation of the federal reserve board

the federal reserve board may impose additional limitations or restrictions on our activities  including if the federal reserve board believes that we do not have the appropriate financial and managerial resources to commence or conduct an activity or make an acquisition 
the federal reserve board may also take actions as appropriate to enforce applicable federal law 
technology and operating risk could constrain our operations 
we are highly dependent on the integrity of our technology  operating systems and premises 
although we have in place certain disaster recovery plans  we may experience system delays and interruptions as a result of natural disasters  power failures  acts of war  and third party failures  which could negatively impact our operations 
various ongoing governmental investigations and regulatory actions and reforms relating to certain practices in the mutual fund industry could adversely impact our assets under management  future financial results and increase our costs of doing business

the company and  where applicable  the relevant individuals  are providing documents and information in response to these requests and subpoenas 
in addition  the company is responding to requests for similar kinds of information from regulatory authorities in some of the foreign countries where the company conducts its global asset management business 
the company also has been conducting its own internal fact finding inquiry with the assistance of outside counsel 
the company is seeking to determine whether any shareholders of the franklin  templeton and mutual series funds each a fund and together  funds  including company employees  were permitted to engage in late trading or in market timing transactions contrary to the policies of the affected fund and  if so  the circumstances and persons involved 
the company is committed to taking action to protect the interests of our funds shareholders  including appropriate action against any company personnel found to have knowingly permitted or personally engaged in improper trading practices 
to date  the company has identified some instances of frequent trading in shares of certain funds by a few current or former employees in their personal k plan accounts 
these individuals include one trader and one officer of the funds 
these two individuals have been placed on administrative leave and the officer has resigned from his positions with the funds

the company s internal inquiry regarding market timing and late trading is still ongoing  and we have not yet completed the gathering or evaluation of the relevant facts 
although we have not identified any late trading problems  we have identified various instances of frequent trading where we have questions about the propriety of what occurred and what responsibility  if any  the company may bear 
pending completion of the fact finding process  one officer of a subsidiary of the company has been placed on administrative leave 
if the company finds that it bears responsibility for any unlawful or inappropriate conduct that caused losses to our funds  we are committed to making the funds whole

effective november   the company determined not to direct any further brokerage where the allocation is based on sale of fund shares in order to satisfy preferred list or other shelf space arrangements  which determination may have a material adverse financial impact on the company 
the company cannot state with certainty the eventual outcome of the foregoing governmental investigations  the review by independent outside counsel or the company s own internal investigation  which could have a material negative financial impact on the company 
however  public trust and confidence are critical to the company s business and any material loss of investor and or client confidence could result in a significant decline in assets under management by the company  which would have an adverse effect on future financial results 
in addition  pending regulatory and legislative actions and reforms affecting the mutual fund industry may significantly increase the company s costs of doing business and or negatively impact its revenues  either of which could have a material negative impact on the company s financial results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  our financial position is subject to market risk the potential loss due to changes in the value of investments resulting from adverse changes in interest rates  foreign exchange and or equity prices 
management is responsible for managing this risk 
our enterprise risk management committee is responsible for providing a framework to assist management to identify  assess and manage market and other risks 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily through financing transactions and portfolio debt holdings available for sale  which are carried at fair value in our financial statements 
as of september   a significant percentage of our outstanding debt was at fixed interest rates 
in our banking finance operating segment  we monitor the net interest rate margin and the average maturity of interest earning assets  as well as funding sources 
in addition  as of september   we have considered the potential impact of the effect on the banking finance operating segment balances  our outstanding debt and portfolio debt holdings  individually and collectively  of a basis point movement in market interest rates 
we do not expect this change would have a material impact on our operating revenues or results of operations in either scenario 
we operate primarily in the united states  but also provide services and earn revenues in canada  the bahamas  europe  asia  south america  africa and australia 
a significant portion of these revenues and associated expenses  however  are denominated in us dollars 
therefore  our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations in our revenues and expenses is not material at this time 
this situation may change in the future as our business continues to grow outside the united states 
we are also exposed to equity price fluctuations through securities we hold that are carried at fair value 
to mitigate this risk  we maintain a diversified investment portfolio
