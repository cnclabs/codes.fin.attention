item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are an analytics based purchaser and manager of past due consumer accounts receivable 
past due accounts receivable are the unpaid debts of individuals to consumer creditors such as banks  finance companies  retail merchants  hospitals  utilities  and other consumer oriented companies 
we use our proprietary pricing models and extensive analytical databases to evaluate and value accounts receivable purchases 
most of our accounts receivable are visa r and mastercard r credit card accounts that the issuing banks have charged off their books for non payment 
by selling past due accounts receivable to us  credit grantors recover some of their charged off accounts 
on february   creditrust merged with and into us  at which time we became a publicly traded company 
the merger was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
as a result of the merger  we issued  shares of common stock resulting in a total of  shares of our common stock outstanding  including  shares held in escrow 
in  the  shares held in escrow were distributed to eligible stockholders upon the final resolution of certain disputed and administrative claims 
the purchase price was valued at approximately million 
additional acquisition related costs incurred in connection with the merger were million 
we allocated the purchase price based on the fair value of the net assets acquired  principally to purchased accounts receivable  deferred tax asset and certain assumed liabilities 
the net deferred tax asset of million was the result of the combination of a significant net operating loss carryforward acquired in the merger  offset by deferred tax liabilities arising from book tax differences in the carrying value of the acquired accounts receivable 
the purchase price allocation and determination of certain income tax valuations estimated at the merger date have been finalized and are reflected in the financial statements as of december  and from our inception in  we have invested million million in  million in  million in including million from the merger  and million in in past due consumer accounts receivable 
at december   we managed over million accounts with an original charged off amount of almost billion measured as the amount charged off by the credit grantors that originated the charged off visa r  mastercard r  private label credit cards and consumer loan accounts at the date of charge off 
the following table illustrates our revenue and collection experience for the periods indicated amounts in thousands for the years ended december  revenue    revenue as a percentage of collections collections on managed accounts receivable    collections applied to principal on managed accounts receivable 
   revenue as a percentage of collections is presented because we rely on this indicator in the management of our business as a key measure of our overall return on investment on purchased accounts receivable 
managed accounts receivable include purchased accounts receivable that we own and accounts receivable that we invest in but do not own  including purchased accounts receivable in our investment in securitization  spv  but excluding purchased accounts receivable of our joint venture with imnv 
collections applied to principal of managed accounts receivable is calculated by subtracting revenue recognized from collections on managed accounts receivable 
collections applied to principal of owned purchased accounts receivable amounted to   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the information presented for the year ended december  includes the results of the merger from february  to december   and is not comparable to and critical accounting policies general the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the accompanying notes 
actual results will differ from those estimates 
we believe the following accounting policies include the estimates that are the most critical and could have the most potential impact on our results of operations 
for further discussion of other significant accounting policies  see notes to consolidated financial statements of the company note b 
purchased accounts receivable we account for our investment in purchased accounts receivable on an accrual basis under the guidance of the american institute of certified public accountants practice bulletin  amortization of discounts on certain acquired loans  using unique and exclusive portfolios 
portfolios are established with accounts having similar attributes 
typically  each portfolio consists of an individual acquisition of accounts that are initially recorded at cost 
once a portfolio is established  the accounts in the portfolio are not changed 
proceeds from the sale of accounts and return of accounts within a portfolio are accounted for as collections in that portfolio 
the discount between the cost of each portfolio and the face value of the portfolio is not recorded since we expect to collect a relatively small percentage of each portfolio s face value 
collections on the portfolios are allocated to revenue and principal reduction based on the estimated internal rate of return irr for each portfolio 
the irr for each portfolio is derived based on the expected monthly collections over the estimated economic life of each portfolio generally five years  based on our collection experience  compared to the original purchase price 
revenue on purchased accounts receivable is recorded monthly based on applying each portfolio s effective irr to each portfolio s monthly opening carrying value effective interest method 
to the extent collections exceed the revenue  the carrying value is reduced and the reduction is recorded as collections are applied to principal 
because the irr reflects estimated collections for the entire economic life of the portfolio  and those collections are not constant  lower collection rates  typically in the early months of ownership  can result in a situation where the actual collections are less than the revenue accrual 
in this situation  the carrying value of the portfolio may be increased by the difference between the revenue accrual and collections 
to the extent actual collections differ from the estimate of collections  we prospectively adjust the irr 
if the carrying value of a particular portfolio exceeds its expected future collections  a charge to income would be recognized in the amount of such impairment 
additional impairments on previously impaired portfolios may occur if the current estimates of future collections are less than the current carrying value recorded 
after the impairment of a portfolio  all collections are recorded as a return of capital and no income is recorded on that portfolio until the full carrying value of the portfolio has been recovered 
for the years ended december  and  impairments of million and million  respectively  were recorded as a charge to income on portfolios where the carrying amounts exceeded the expected future cash flows 
no income will be recognized on these portfolios until the carrying values have been fully recovered 
the combined carrying values on these impaired portfolios aggregated approximately million  or percent  and million  or percent  of purchased accounts receivable  as of december  and  respectively  representing their net realizable value 
there were no impairments recorded in use of estimates in the ordinary course of accounting for purchased accounts receivable  estimates have been made by management as to the amount of future cash flows expected from each portfolio 
the estimated future cash flow of each portfolio is used to compute the irr for the portfolio 
the irr is used to allocate collections between revenue and amortization of the carrying values of the purchased accounts receivable 
on an ongoing basis  we compare the historical trends of each portfolio to projected collections 
projected collections are then increased  within preset limits  or decreased based on the actual cumulative performance of each portfolio 
we review each portfolio s adjusted projected collections to determine if further downward adjustment is warranted 
management regularly reviews the trends in collection patterns and uses its best efforts to improve under performing portfolios 
however  actual results will differ from these estimates and a material change in these estimates could occur within one year 
for the year ended december   differences between actual and estimated collections on existing portfolios as of the beginning of resulted in a reduction in revenue  net of estimated servicing costs and impairment expense  of million 
for the year ended december   differences between actual and estimated collections on existing portfolios as of the beginning of resulted in a reduction in revenue  net of estimated servicing costs and impairment expense  of million 
cargill financing our cargill financing carries both a conventional coupon rate of interest and a residual share of collections  net of servicing fees  for the life of each portfolio financed 
we account for this deferred interest expense throughout the life of the receivables financed by accruing interest equal to cargill financial s share of book net income on each portfolio financed 
investments in debt and equity securities we acquired an investment in securitization in connection with the merger 
the investment in securitization  spv  qualified as a sale under generally accepted accounting principles in when the securitization was completed 
the investment in securitization is accounted for under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  as a debt security held available for sale 
this investment accrues income as a noncash item included in the statement of income as other income  and in the balance sheet as a component of the fair value of the investment in securitization 
once the securitization note is retired  recoveries will be applied to reduce the carrying value of the investment in securitization 
we record our investment in securitization at fair value and any unrealized gain or loss  net of the related tax effect  generally is not reflected in earnings but is recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity until realized 
as of december   the carrying value approximated fair value 
a decline in the value of the investment in securitization below cost that is deemed other than temporary would be charged to income as an impairment and result in the establishment of a new cost basis for the security 
no impairments were recorded in and income taxes income taxes or tax benefits have been provided in the results of operations based on the statutory federal and state rates at percent of pre tax income 
for financial reporting purposes  revenue is recognized over the life of the portfolio 
because the portfolios of purchased accounts receivable are comprised of distressed debt and collection results are not guaranteed until received  for tax purposes  any gain on a particular portfolio is deferred until the full cost of the portfolio is recovered cost recovery method 
temporary differences arise due to the differences in revenue recognition methods 
permanent differences between the statutory tax rates and actual rates are minimal 
temporary differences arising from the recognition of revenue on purchased accounts receivable have resulted in deferred tax liabilities 
assumed utilization of net operating losses acquired in the merger have resulted in deferred tax assets 
our deferred tax liabilities grew significantly through as a result of the increase in purchased accounts receivable  providing us with additional liquidity 
as of december   the net deferred tax liability of million was the result of the combination of deferred tax assets generated principally by the assumed utilization of net operating loss carryforwards from the merger  offset by the deferred tax liabilities arising from book tax differences on purchased accounts receivable  including the purchased accounts receivable acquired in the merger 
the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards is an estimate based on a number of factors beyond our control  including the level of taxable income available from successful operations in the future 
the utilization of net operating losses acquired in the merger has been further impacted by federal tax law provisions that limit the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that can be utilized subsequent to a change in control 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain data from the statement of income on an historical basis  each as a percentage of revenue for the years ended december  revenue operating costs and expenses payroll and related expenses servicing fee expenses selling  general  and administrative expenses amortization expense impairment of purchased accounts receivable total operating costs and expenses income from operations other income expense interest and other income interest expense total other expense income before income tax expense income tax expense income from operations before minority interest minority interest net income the information presented for the year ended december  includes the results of the merger from february  to december   and is not comparable to and year ended december  compared to year ended december  for comparison purposes  the year ended december  includes the results of operations for creditrust from february  through december  revenue 
total revenue increased by  or percent  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  collections on managed purchased accounts receivable increased million  or percent  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  as the total amount of purchased accounts receivable under management grew from million in to million in total purchases were million in versus million in included in collections for the year ended december   was million in proceeds from the sales of accounts  of which million was received as a payment on the sale of certain nonperforming accounts to a leading credit card issuer 
additionally  during  we concluded a contract renegotiation with the seller of several existing portfolios resulting in a million cash price reduction on purchases from and the million proceeds were recorded as an adjustment to purchase price of the affected portfolios 
on several previously impaired portfolios  the cash price reduction reduced the carrying value of such portfolios  resulting in the cost of certain of the portfolios becoming fully recovered 
included in revenue for the year ended december   was  that resulted from the contract price reduction of these fully recovered portfolios 
actual collection results have differed from estimated projections 
for the year ended december   differences between actual and estimated collections on existing portfolios as of the beginning of resulted in a reduction in revenue  net of estimated servicing costs and impairment expense  of million 
revenue as a percentage of collections was percent and percent for the years ended december  and  respectively 
revenue as a percentage of collections can fluctuate period over period due to a number of factors including i the relative under or over achievement of actual collections versus the established estimates 
actual collections exceeding estimates will tend to lower the percentage because revenue is not impacted at the same rate as the change in collections due to the effective interest method of computing revenue  and conversely  not meeting collection estimates will tend to increase the percentage  ii the differences in the composition of portfolios at a point in time in their life cycle 
over the life cycle of a portfolio  the percentage will fluctuate due to the variable collection stream 
however  in the aggregate  the percentage of collections recognized as revenue should approximate the lifetime profit  before servicing costs  recognized and the remainder is amortized as a return of capital  iii the composition of the targeted irrs present in all of the portfolios combined 
fresher purchased accounts receivable portfolios with few or no placements to collection agencies prior to purchase generally have lower irrs than purchased accounts receivable that have been placed with multiple collection agencies prior to purchase 
fresher accounts receivable typically cost more 
however  net of servicing fees  lower irrs are offset by lower costs to collect  resulting in similar targeted net returns  iv collection trends will increase or decrease our expected irr 
increases or decreases in collections have the effect of raising within specified parameters or lowering the future collection projections on all portfolios  which translates into higher or lower irrs  and in turn  affects the percentage of collections recognized as revenue  and finally  v portfolios that become impaired are placed on cost recovery  and no revenue will be recorded until their carrying value has been fully recovered 
after the carrying value has been fully recovered  all collections are recorded as revenue 
revenue as a percentage of collections declined in versus due to a number of these factors 
first  the total composition of purchased accounts receivable has changed somewhat from purchased accounts receivable acquired in  and subsequent to  the merger were acquired at a lower irr compared to accounts receivable purchased in prior years 
purchases of accounts receivable made in the latter half of and continuing through have returns that were targeted lower at the time of acquisition due to reduced collection estimates due to the tougher economic climate facing us in the near term  and due to larger purchases with components of reperforming accounts past due accounts that are now performing 
second  the overall percentage was lowered due to a slow down in collections on existing portfolios as a result of the continued softening economic climate in shortfalls in current period collection estimates had the effect of lowering the future projections on most older portfolios  which translated to lower irrs and revenue compared to collections in the current period 
third  proceeds from sales of accounts totaling million are included in collections and had a marginal impact on revenue as the rate at which revenue is recognized period to period is not affected at the same rate as changes in collections due to the effective interest method of computing revenue 
finally  portfolios with million in carrying value  or percent of total purchased accounts receivable  as of december  have been impaired and placed on cost recovery status 
accordingly  no revenue was recorded on these portfolios after their impairment 
all of these factors equate to a lower ratio of revenue to collections 
payroll and related expenses 
payroll and related expenses decreased  or percent  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  payroll and related expenses remain a small part of the business model as a percentage of revenue because our collection activities and many administrative functions are outsourced to ncof 
the decrease in payroll and related expenses was principally due to the legal recovery and agency outsourcing groups being transferred to the ncof attorney network during  as well as a decrease in overall incentive compensation in compared to servicing fee expenses 
servicing fee expenses increased million  or percent  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  servicing fees are paid as a commission on collections and include contingency legal fees 
servicing fee expenses are impacted by the volume of collections on purchased accounts receivable and the type of accounts receivable acquired  which effects the servicing fee rates charged by ncof 
servicing fees paid as a percentage of collections were percent and percent for the years ended december  and  respectively 
substantially all servicing fees were paid to ncof for the years ended december  and included in servicing fees for the year ended december  was  in servicing fees paid on million in sale proceeds received from the sale of nonperforming accounts to a leading credit card issuer 
the increase in servicing fees as a percentage of collections from to was principally attributable to the change in the composition of accounts receivable under management 
in general  the accounts receivable acquired in the merger have lower servicing fees as compared to accounts receivable purchased since the merger because collections were more predictable as a result of creditrust s experience with these portfolios and had a component of re performing accounts 
we expect that servicing fees as a percentage of collections will increase in the future as collections from accounts receivable acquired in the merger decline in proportion to total collections 
further  ncof has and may continue to outsource collections in an attempt to offset negative economic trends  to test itself  and generally to augment resources 
the servicing cost to us resulting from outsourcing is generally higher on such accounts since they are relatively more difficult to resolve 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or percent  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of filing fees and court costs associated with legal collections  insurance  professional fees  trustee fees  and office expenses 
the increase was principally attributable to increased court costs associated with legal collections  professional fees associated with operational compliance activities  and postage in connection with mailings required by the graham leach bliley privacy act 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december   have been reduced by  relating to the reduction of certain estimated merger related liabilities as finally determined from the closure of creditrust s chapter bankruptcy  in the fourth quarter 
impairment of purchased accounts receivable 
during  we recorded an impairment of million  compared to million in the combined remaining carrying value on impaired portfolios aggregated million  or percent of total purchased accounts receivable  as of december   compared to million  or percent of total purchased accounts receivable as of december  impairments have occurred principally on older portfolios purchased prior to the merger at somewhat higher prices and with original projections predicated on higher collection rates experienced historically under better economic circumstances 
the decline in impairment experience is principally due to most of these earlier purchases becoming impaired in further  by adjusting under performing portfolios downward by each portfolio s historical trend  the remaining collection estimates are lowered and the likelihood of additional impairments is reduced 
other income expense 
other income expense decreased  or percent  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  interest expense was flat year over year at million due to increased borrowings on new purchases largely offsetting debt repayment on the existing revolver and secured debt 
offsetting interest expense and included in other income is income from two unconsolidated subsidiaries 
interest expense totaled million for each of the years ended december  and interest income and other income totaled  and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase was principally attributable to growth in net earnings due to additional investments in the joint venture with imnv 
income tax expense 
income tax expense was recorded at percent of pre tax income for each of the years ended december  and tax payments in and were deferred due to the book tax difference of accounting for purchased accounts receivable on the accrual basis for generally accepted accounting principles and the cost recovery basis for tax reporting 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue 
total revenue increased by million  or percent  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase in revenue was attributable to the purchase of million in accounts receivable  consisting of million of accounts receivable acquired in our merger with creditrust  and an additional million in accounts receivable purchased in through normal operations 
the carrying value of the purchased accounts receivable increased significantly over the prior year 
collections on purchased accounts receivable increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  due to the increase in purchased accounts receivable 
revenue as a percentage of collections was percent and percent for the years ended december  and  respectively 
revenue as a percentage of collections for the year ended december   declined principally due to changes in the mix of purchased accounts receivable in versus purchased accounts receivable acquired in the merger were acquired at a lower irr compared to accounts receivable purchased in prior years 
net after servicing costs  these purchased accounts receivable are expected to equal or exceed our usual targeted net returns 
further affecting the lower percentage for were current acquisitions that had returns that were targeted lower at the time of acquisition due to the tougher economic climate facing us in the near term 
finally  the overall percentage was lowered due to a slow down in collections due to the softening economic climate in the first three quarters of  accelerated by the events of september actual collection results have differed from estimated projections 
for the year ended december   differences between actual and estimated collections on existing portfolios as of the beginning of  resulted in a reduction of revenue  net of estimated servicing costs and impairment expense  of million portfolios with million in carrying value  or percent of purchased accounts receivable  as of december  were impaired during and placed on cost recovery 
accordingly  no revenue was recorded on these portfolios after their impairment  equating to a lower ratio of revenue to collections 
see impairment of purchased accounts receivable below 
payroll and related expenses 
payroll and related expenses increased from  for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase was attributable to an increase in personnel during the first quarter of directly related to the merger 
payroll and related expenses after the merger increased as more staffing was implemented for us to operate as an independent public company and to manage a significant increase in purchased accounts receivable due to the merger and internal growth 
servicing fee expenses 
servicing fee expenses increased million  or percent  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase in servicing fee expenses is directly attributable to the increase in collections on purchased accounts receivable 
servicing fees paid as a percentage of collections were percent and percent for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in servicing fees as a percentage of collections was principally attributable to the lower serving fees paid in connection with the purchased accounts receivable acquired in the merger 
though the mix of accounts acquired in the merger were generally older and had been through multiple placements compared to current purchases  collections were more predictable as a result of creditrust s experience with these portfolios  and had a component of re performing accounts 
we expect that servicing fees as a percentage of collections will increase in the future as collections from accounts receivable acquired in the merger decline in proportion to total collections 
further  ncof has and may continue to outsource collections in an attempt to offset negative economic trends  to test itself  and generally to augment resources 
the servicing cost to us resulting from outsourcing is generally higher on such accounts since they are relatively more difficult to resolve 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased from  for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of filing fees and court costs associated with legal collections  insurance  professional fees  trustee fees  and office expenses 
the increase was attributable to costs incurred in connection with being an independent public company  and outside collection costs related to the accounts receivable acquired in the merger 
impairment of purchased accounts receivable 
during  we recorded an impairment of million 
the combined remaining carrying value on impaired portfolios aggregated million  or percent of purchased accounts receivable  as of december  no impairments were recorded in impairments have occurred principally on older portfolios purchased prior to the merger at somewhat higher prices and with original projections predicated on higher collection rates experienced historically under better economic circumstances 
other income expense 
other income expense consisted principally of interest expense and increased million  or percent  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase was principally attributable to an increase in interest expense as a result of million in debt incurred and assumed in connection with the merger  as well as increased borrowings from nco group to fund the purchase of accounts receivable in included in other income is  of income from two unconsolidated subsidiaries 
income tax expense 
income tax expense was recorded at percent of pre tax income for the years ended december  and tax payments in were deferred due to the book tax difference of accounting for purchased accounts receivable on the accrual basis for gaap and the cost recovery basis for tax reporting 
prior to the merger  we were included in the consolidated tax return of nco group 
we received a tax sharing payment of  from nco group for tax losses incurred during the period prior to the merger 
liquidity and capital resources historically  we derived all of our cash flow from collections on purchased accounts receivable and borrowings from nco group 
effective with the merger  we entered into a credit agreement with nco group in the form of a subfacility under its existing credit facility 
borrowings under the subfacility have been used primarily for the purchase of accounts receivable  the merger and working capital to support our growth 
nco group has a credit agreement with citizens bank  for itself and as administrative agent for other participating lenders that originally provided for borrowings up to million  structured as a revolving credit facility 
the borrowing capacity of the credit facility is subject to quarterly reductions of million until maturity  and percent of the net proceeds received from any offering of debt or equity 
as of december   there was million available under the credit agreement 
nco group s borrowings are collateralized by substantially all the assets of nco group  including our common stock owned by nco group 
pursuant to the merger  we entered into a credit agreement with nco group in the form of a subfacility under its existing credit facility 
certain of our assets have been pledged to citizens bank and other participating lenders to secure our borrowings under the subfacility 
the balance on the ncog credit facility and our subfacility will become due on may  the borrowing capacity of the subfacility is subject to quarterly reductions 
effective march   quarterly reductions of million are required until the earlier of may  or the date at which the subfacility is reduced to million 
the maximum borrowing capacity on the subfacility was reduced by million each quarter in and was million as of december the nco group credit agreement and the ncog subfacility contain certain financial covenants such as maintaining net worth and funded debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization ebitda ratio requirements  and include restrictions on  among other things  acquisitions and distributions to stockholders 
as of december   ncog and we were in compliance with all of the financial covenants 
the subfacility carries interest at percent over nco group s underlying rate from citizens bank and other participating lenders  of which percent is paid to the lenders and percent is paid to nco group 
at the option of nco group  nco group s borrowings bear interest at a rate equal to either citizens bank s prime rate plus a margin ranging from percent to percent that is determined quarterly based upon nco group s consolidated funded debt to ebitda ratio citizens bank s prime rate was percent at december   or the london interbank offered rate libor plus a margin ranging from percent to percent depending on nco group s consolidated funded debt to ebitda ratio libor was percent at december  
as of december  and  the outstanding balance under the subfacility was million and million  respectively 
total availability under the subfacility as of december  was million 
we have two secured notes payable which were assumed in the merger that have debt service payments equal to total collections less servicing fees and expenses 
no additional borrowings are available on these notes 
the combined balances of these two secured notes payable amounted to million and million as of december  and  respectively 
these borrowings carry interest at libor plus percent and percent  respectively  and mature on march and december  respectively 
one of these secured notes has a  liquidity reserve that restricts our use of cash 
the reserve will be returned to us upon full satisfaction of the note 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of the financial covenants under the notes 
we also have a note payable related to our unconsolidated subsidiary that we assumed in connection with the merger 
this note payable matures on january  carries an interest rate of percent  and had a balance of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
in may  another secured note assumed in the merger was paid off 
all collections from this note are now remitted directly to us and are used to purchase new receivables and fund operations 
in august  we entered into a four year financing agreement with cargill financial to provide financing for larger purchases of accounts receivable at percent of the purchase price  unless otherwise negotiated 
cargill financial  at its sole discretion  has the right to finance any purchase of million or more 
this agreement gives us the financing to purchase larger portfolios that we may not otherwise be able to purchase  and has no minimum or maximum credit authorization 
borrowings carry interest at the prime rate plus percent prime rate was percent as of december   and are nonrecourse to us and ncog  except for the assets within the special purpose entities established in connection with this financing agreement 
debt service payments equal total collections less servicing fees and expenses until each individual borrowing is fully repaid and our original investment is returned  including interest 
thereafter  cargill financial is paid a residual of percent of collections less servicing costs  unless otherwise negotiated 
individual loans are required to be repaid based on collections  but not more than two years from the date of borrowing 
total debt outstanding under this facility as of december  was million 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of the financial covenants 
we currently have a fixed price  three month renewable agreement forward flow with a major financial institution that obligates us to purchase  on a monthly basis  portfolios of charged off receivables meeting certain criteria 
as of december   we were obligated to purchase accounts receivable to a maximum of million per month through may a portion of the purchase price is deferred for twelve months  including a nominal rate of interest 
ncog guarantees this forward flow agreement 
included in notes payable is million of deferred purchase price as of december  incurred on purchases from june through december the debt service requirements associated with borrowings under our secured credit facilities  including the borrowings under the cargill financial agreement  and the mandatory reductions on our subfacility from ncog have increased liquidity requirements 
the availability under the subfacility was reduced to as of december   and provides for additional mandatory reductions of million per quarter starting march  until the subfacility is reduced to million 
all of our secured debt requires amortization of principal based on total collections net of servicing fees and expenses on the secured portfolios 
we anticipate that cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund all mandatory reductions on the subfacility  debt service payments on secured debt  operating expenses  interest expense and mandatory purchases of accounts receivable under our existing forward flow agreement 
cash flows from operations are directly related to the amount of collections actually received 
estimates are used to forecast collections and revenue 
a decrease in cash flows from operations due to a decrease in collections from changes in the economy or the performance of ncof as service provider  may require us to reduce the amount of accounts receivable purchased 
the effect of reduced accounts receivable purchases would be a reduction in planned collections and revenue in the periods affected 
contractual obligations the following summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  amounts in thousands

net income decreased from million in to million in additionally  million in restricted cash was released and used to pay down debt in pursuant to the merger  compared to  of restricted cash being released in when a secured note was fully paid off 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in cash and cash equivalents provided by operations was principally attributable to the large increase in net income and deferred income tax expense 
net income grew due to the significant increase in revenue generated from the million of accounts receivable acquired in the merger  and million in other accounts receivable purchased in the normal course of business in additionally  approximately million in restricted cash was released and used to pay down debt in the first quarter of pursuant to the merger 
cash flows from investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  net cash used in investing activities is principally a function of the amount of accounts receivable purchased  offset by collections applied to principal of purchased accounts receivable 
while cash purchases of accounts receivable grew to million in from million in  the amount of collections applied to principal of accounts receivable  including a purchase price adjustment of million from the renegotiation of a contract  grew to million in from million in in  we invested million in our joint venture  and we received  in cash through our investment in a consolidated subsidiary from the minority interest

cash flows from financing activities 
net cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to cash provided by investing activities of million for the year ended december  borrowings under the cargill financing totaled million for  compared to borrowings under the ncog subfacility of million in payments on secured notes payable and the ncog subfacility amounted to million in  compared to million in repayments on secured notes payable in in  there was million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock at the time of the merger  and  in fees paid to secure the nco group credit facility

net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  total borrowings increased to million in  of which million related to debt incurred in the merger  from million in partially offsetting total borrowings  million was repaid on notes payable during all of the borrowings in were from the nco group credit facility 
additionally  there was million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock at the time of the merger  and  in fees paid to secure the nco group credit facility 
off balance sheet arrangements we own a percent retained residual interest in an investment in securitization  spv  which was acquired in the merger 
this transaction qualified for gain on sale accounting when the purchased receivables were originally securitized 
this securitization issued a nonrecourse note that is due the earlier of january or satisfaction of the note from collections  and had a balance of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the retained interest represents the present value of the residual interest in the securitization using discounted future cash flows after the securitization note is fully repaid  plus a cash reserve 
as of december  and  the investment in securitization was million and million  respectively  composed of million and million  respectively  in the present value of discounted residual cash flows plus million in cash reserves 
the maximum exposure to loss as a result of the company s involvement with this investment in securitization would be limited to the carrying value of the investment in the securitization 
the investment accrues noncash income at a rate of percent per annum on the residual cash flow component only 
the income earned increases the investment balance until the securitization note has been repaid  after which  collections are split between income and amortization of the investment in securitization based on the discounted cash flows 
we recorded  and  of income on this investment for the year ended december  and for the period from february  to december   respectively

accounting for certain purchased loans or debt securities formerly known as discounts related to credit quality exposure draft december the exposure draft applies to all companies that acquire loans for which it is probable at the acquisition date that all contractual amounts due under the acquired loans will not be collected 
the proposal addresses accounting for differences between contractual and expected future cash flows from an investor s initial investment in certain loans when such differences are attributable  in part  to credit quality 
the scope also includes such loans acquired in purchased business combinations 
if adopted  the proposed statement of position sop would supersede practice bulletin  amortization of discounts on certain acquired loans 
in june  the fasb cleared the sop for issuance subject to minor editorial changes and planned to issue a final sop in early the sop has not yet been issued 
the proposed sop would limit the revenue that may be accrued to the excess of the estimate of expected future cash flows over the portfolio s initial cost of accounts receivable acquired 
the proposed sop would require that the excess of the contractual cash flows over expected future cash flows not be recognized as an adjustment of revenue  expense or on the balance sheet 
the proposed sop would freeze the irr originally estimated when the accounts receivable are purchased for subsequent impairment testing 
rather than lower the estimated irr if the original collection estimates are not received  the carrying value of a portfolio would be written down to maintain the original irr 
increases in expected future cash flows would be recognized prospectively through adjustment of the irr over a portfolio s remaining life 
the exposure draft provides that previously issued annual financial statements would not need to be restated 
until final issuance of this sop  we cannot ascertain its effect on our reporting
