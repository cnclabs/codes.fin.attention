item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read together with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  appearing elsewhere in this form k 
this item contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ materially from those indicated in such forward looking statements 
factors that may cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  those discussed in item  business certain risks related to our business 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap 
we review the accounting policies  including those described in note  significant accounting policies  we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to our accounts receivable  net  income taxes  goodwill  software development costs  fair value of financial instruments and commitments and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit committee and disclosure committee 
see  preparation of financial information in this section  for further discussion of the disclosure committee 
we believe the following critical accounting policies relate to those policies that are most important to the presentation of our financial statements and require the most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
accounts receivable  net 
accounts receivable as presented in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet are net of reserves for customer allowances and doubtful accounts 
we determine allowances for accounts receivable based on specific identification of customer accounts requiring allowances and the application of a predetermined percentage to the remaining accounts receivable balances 
generally  we determine the allowance based on our assessment of the realization of receivables using historical information and current economic trends  including assessing the probability of collection from customers 
if there is a deterioration of a major customer s credit worthiness or actual defaults are higher than our historical experience  the recoverability of amounts due could be adversely affected 
income taxes 
deferred income taxes are provided for timing differences in recognizing certain income and expense items for financial reporting purposes 
such deferred income taxes primarily relate to the timing of recognition of certain revenue and expense items  the timing of the deductibility of certain reserves and accruals for income tax purposes 
we establish a tax valuation allowance to the extent that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realizable against future taxable income 
during we recorded a net loss of million on the write off of the channelpoint investment and note receivable  including accrued interest 
for tax purposes  million of this loss was considered a capital loss  which can only be offset with net capital gains 
we believe that it is more likely than not that the capital loss will not be realized  therefore  a valuation allowance has been established for this item 
we also have foreign net operating losses from prior years related to our former ccc international operations 
we have established a valuation allowance for the full amount of these foreign net operating losses because realization of these assets is not more likely than not 
we have considered future market growth  forecasted earnings  future taxable income  the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for valuation allowances 
in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
likewise  if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized  the previously provided valuation allowances would be reversed 
during the third quarter of  the company filed amended income tax returns to claim research and experimentation tax credits applicable to the years  and and recorded a credit to income tax expense of million  which is the company s best estimate of the amount of tax credits to be realized 
the company also recorded research and experimentation credits of million for we believe that our approach in determining the amount of credits is reasonable  however this could ultimately result in changes  once they are reviewed by taxing authorities 
goodwill 
in  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas became effective for the company january  under sfas  goodwill is no longer amortized to earnings  but instead is reviewed for impairment on at least an annual basis 
the company completed the required transitional impairment analysis on june  and determined that there was no impairment in the value of goodwill 
in addition  when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable  we perform an analysis of undiscounted future cash flows to determine whether recorded amounts are impaired 
as of december   no such events or changes in circumstances have occurred since our impairment analysis was performed in june the unamortized goodwill balance as of december  was million 
this goodwill originated from a acquisition that included the total loss service 
we currently generate approximately of our total revenue from total loss and related services 
in the future  net cash flows from the total loss service will be utilized in determining if the goodwill is impaired 
at december   no such impairment existed 
software development costs 
the company expenses research and development costs as they are incurred 
the company has evaluated the establishment of technological feasibility of its software products in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed 
the company sells its software products in a market that is subject to rapid technological change  new product development and changing customer needs 
accordingly  technological feasibility of the company s software products is generally not established until the development of the software product is nearly complete 
the company defines technological feasibility as the completion of a working model 
the period of time during which costs could be capitalized  from the point of reaching technological feasibility until the time of general product release  has historically been very short and  consequently  amounts subject to capitalization have not been significant 
should our development process change significantly the company would reevaluate the impact of sfas no 
fair value of financial instruments 
the carrying amount of our financial instruments approximates their estimated fair value based upon market prices for the same or similar type of financial instruments 
we perform an impairment review whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these investments and notes receivable may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include market conditions  valuations for similar companies  financial performance and a going concern risk 
during the year ended december   we determined that certain investments and notes receivable had incurred a decline in value that was considered other than temporary 
we determined that the carrying value of our investments in and related notes receivable from channelpoint and infocars may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above impairment factors 
we recorded a charge of million and million for channelpoint and infocars  respectively  which represented the remaining carrying value of these investments 
in addition  we provided allowances of million and million for the notes receivables and accrued interest from channelpoint and infocars  respectively 
commitments and contingencies 
loss contingencies are recorded as liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
contingent liabilities are often resolved over long time periods 
estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors that often depend on judgments about potential actions by third parties such as regulators 
we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted 
in  we recorded a charge of million to write off excess office space in chicago  formerly occupied by drivelogic 
this charge was recorded after a complete review of our short term and long term facility requirements 
the charge included future rent commitments of million and the write off of leasehold improvements of million  net of expected future sublease income of million 
during  the company recorded an additional million charge to revise the estimated future sublease income from million to million as a result of the current weak conditions of the real estate market 
if the company has not sublet the office space by september   we will reevaluate the amount recorded  at that time 
however  if events or circumstances change prior to september   the company will reevaluate the charge at that time 
the lease for this office space expires march  while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate  significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions would affect the charge recorded 
we recorded a charge of million  net of an expected insurance reimbursement of million  in as an estimate of the amount we will contribute towards the potential settlement of the largest of the class action lawsuits related to our total loss valuation service 
this charge was based on statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for contingencies that establishes standards of financial accounting and reporting for loss contingencies 
we anticipate that the settlement would eliminate the viability of class claims in of the class action suits pending against the company related to the total loss service 
upon completion  the anticipated settlement would resolve potential claims arising out of approximately of the company s total transaction volume during the time period covered by the lawsuit 
the company currently anticipates that the proposed settlement would include a resolution of any potential claims for indemnification or contribution by its customers relating to the transactions covered by the settlement 
as of december   the company believes that the charge recorded is an appropriate estimate for the settlement of the claims covered by the anticipated settlement 
as additional information is gathered and the litigations both those covered by the anticipated settlement  as well as others proceed  we will continue to assess their potential impact 
preparation of financial information we believe that the application of accounting standards is as important as the underlying financial data in reporting our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
the company believes that its accounting policies are prudent and provide a clear view of the company s financial performance 
the company has formed a disclosure committee  composed of senior management  including senior financial and legal personnel  to help ensure the completeness and accuracy of the company s financial results and disclosures 
in addition  prior to the release of the company s financial results  the company s key management reviews the company s annual and quarterly results  along with key accounting policies and estimates  with the audit committee of our board of directors

depreciation and amortization decreased as a result of fewer investments in internal use software and customer leased computer equipment and our adoption in january of sfas  which ceased the amortization of goodwill 
product development and programming 
product development and programming decreased from million  or of revenue  to million  or of revenue 
the decrease was due to lower development expenses  resulting from the consolidation of our drivelogic business unit and the associated reduction in force partially offset by hiring additional staff and additional consulting work for increased product development efforts

interest expense 
interest expense decreased from million in to million in the decrease from was driven by a lower level of borrowings  a decrease in interest rates charged and lower amortization of deferred financing fees related to our credit facility

revenue is expected to increase in the low to mid single digit range  with growth accelerating in the second half of the year 
operating income is expected to be in the to million range

we have the ability to operate with a working capital deficit  as we receive substantial payments from our customers for our services in advance of recognizing the revenues and the costs incurred to provide such services 
we invoice each customer one month in advance for the following month s pathways services 
as such  we typically receive cash from our customers prior to recognizing the revenue and incurring the expense for the services provided
