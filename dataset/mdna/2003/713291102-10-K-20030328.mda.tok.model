critical accounting policies the us securities and exchange commission sec has defined a company s most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on this definition  pepco holdings has identified the critical accounting policies and judgments as addressed below 
principles of consolidation the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of pepco holdings and its wholly owned subsidiaries 
all intercompany balances and transactions between subsidiaries have been eliminated 
investments in entities in which pepco holdings has a to interest are accounted for using the equity method 
under the equity method  investments are initially carried at cost and subsequently adjusted for the company s proportionate share of the investees undistributed earnings or losses and dividends 
accounting policy choices pepco holdings management believes that based on the nature of the businesses that its subsidiaries operate the company has very little choice regarding the accounting policies it utilizes 
for instance  approximately of pepco holdings business consists of its regulated utility operations  which are subject to the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
however  in the areas that pepco holdings is afforded accounting policy choices  management does not believe that the application of different accounting policies than those that it chose would materially impact its financial position or results of operations 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  such as statement of position disclosure of certain significant risks and uncertainties  requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
examples of estimates used by the company include the calculation of the allowance for uncollectible accounts  environmental remediation costs and anticipated collections  unbilled revenue  pension assumptions  fair values used in the purchase method of accounting and the resulting goodwill balance 
although pepco holdings believes that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable  they are based upon information presently available 
actual results may d iffer significantly from these estimates 
revenue recognition power delivery revenues primarily include revenues from the supply and delivery of electricity to the customers of pepco  dpl  and ace 
revenues from the supply and delivery of natural gas to dpl s customers are also included in power delivery

regulatory and other matters termination of agreements for sale of ace electric generating plants under the terms of agreements between ace and nrg energy  inc nrg for the sale of ace s fossil fuel fired electric generating plants deepwater station  conemaugh and keystone stations and bl england station the agreements were subject to termination by either party after february  nrg delivered notice to conectiv on april  terminating these agreements 
on january   the company announced the termination of a second competitive bidding process initiated on may  to sell these ace owned fossil fuel fired electric generating plants 
the company noted that while the competitive bidding process identified a number of interested parties  current conditions in the electric energy market prevented ace from reaching agreements for the sale of these generating assets 
the company remains interested in selling these assets on acceptable terms  but cannot predict whether or not any or all of the plants will be sold  whe ther the njbpu will grant the required approval of any sales agreements  or any related impacts upon recoverable stranded costs 
basic generation service under the provisions of new jersey s electric discount and energy competition act the new jersey act and the njbpu s final decision and order concerning restructuring ace s electric utility business  ace was obligated to provide basic generation service bgs through july   which entailed supplying electricity to customers in ace s service area who do not choose an alternative supplier 
the final decision and order provides for the recovery through customer rates of the costs incurred by ace in providing bgs  including an allowed return on certain electric generating plants  the above market portion of the cost of power purchased from nugs  and the above market portion of costs associated with generating power for bgs customers 
in recognition of this cost based  rate recovery mechanism  when the costs incurred by ace in providing bgs exceed the revenues from billings to ace s customers for bgs  the under recovered costs are defe rred as a regulatory asset 
pursuant to the terms of the restructuring of ace s electric generation business  during  the under recovered costs were first applied to a deferred energy cost liability that was eliminated and then a regulatory asset was established million as of december  
after the initial four year transition period ends july   customer rates are to be adjusted to recover the under recovered cost balance over a reasonable period of time to be determined by the njbpu 
ace s recovery of the deferred costs is subject to review by the njbpu 
on august   in accordance with the provisions of the new jersey act and the njbpu s final decision and order  ace petitioned the njbpu for a million  or  annualized increase in electric rates  effective august  this proposed rate increase is intended to recover ace s deferred cost balance as of august  over a four year period and reset ace s rates such that an under recovery of certain costs is no longer embedded in rates 
ace s recovery of the deferred costs is subject to review by the njbpu  which will determine the amount of cost recovery in accordance with the new jersey act 
the outside auditing firm selected by the njbpu has completed its review and audit of the deferral balance of ace 
a draft report has been provided to ace  and ace has responded to the njbpu and the auditors with factual comments 
a final report was released on february  bgs electricity supply beyond july  was provided for by a bgs auction held in february  which awarded about  mw  or of ace s bgs load to four suppliers for the period from august  to july  the remaining of ace s bgs load is supplied utilizing ace s electric supply  consisting of its fossil fuel fired electric generating plants excluding deepwater  which are used first to meet such bgs load  and its nug contracts  to the extent such electric generating plants are not sufficient to satisfy such load 
any portion of ace s electric supply that exceeds the load requirement of the bgs customers is sold in the wholesale market 
in addition  if any of the four suppliers awarded of ace s bgs load default on performance  ace will offer the defaulted load to the other winning bidders 
if they are not interested  ace will then procure the needed supply from the wholesale market 
any costs related to this new supply that are not covered by remuneration from the supplier in default will be included in the calculation of deferred electric service costs  which are subject to njbpu review and future recovery in customer rate increases 
by decision and order dated december   the njbpu approved the process for the procurement of bgs supply for the period starting august  the decision included holding two separate but simultaneous auctions to procure bgs supply 
the first auction will be for the supply needed to serve large commercial and industrial customers who will be paying an hourly energy price 
there are approximately customers in this group for ace 
the auction will determine the capacity price to be paid by these customers 
the period covered by this auction is august  through may  the second auction will be for the supply needs of the remainder of the bgs customers  and would be for full requirements service energy  capacity  transmission  and ancillary services for these customers 
in this auction  two thirds of the needs will be procured for the same period as the first auction  while the remaining one third of the needs will be p rocured for a period of months 
the results of these auctions will be used to set the rates paid by the customers in each group 
the decision also established working groups to deal with metering issues and customer education 
the auctions were conducted february and  the njbpu approved the results of the auctions on february  ace has entered into bgs supplier agreements with the winning bidders 
if any of the winning bidders were to default on their commitments  ace will offer the defaulted load to other winning bidders  or will make arrangements to purchase the needed supply from pjm administered markets 
securitization under the new jersey act  up to of recovery eligible stranded costs related to electric generating plants and the costs to affect buyouts or buy downs of nug contracts may be recovered through customer rates 
on september   new jersey enacted an amendment amendment to the new jersey act 
the amendment permits the njbpu to authorize the securitization of deferred balances of electric public utilities resulting from the provisions of the new jersey act 
the njbpu may authorize the issuance of transition bonds by an electric public utility or other financing entity in order to i recover stranded costs deemed eligible for rate recovery in a stranded cost recovery order  ii recover rate reduction requirements determined by the njbpu to be necessary under the provisions of the new jersey act  or iii recover basic generation service transition costs 
the njbpu may approve transition bonds with scheduled amortization of up to fiftee n years if related to stranded cost recoveries or recoveries of basic generation service transition costs  or the remaining term of a purchase power agreement if related to the buyout or buy down of long term purchase power contracts with nugs 
on september   the njbpu issued a bondable stranded costs rate order financing order to ace authorizing the issuance of million of transition bonds 
a subsidiary of ace issued transition bonds totaling million on december   in accordance with this financing order 
the proceeds of these bonds will be used to recover the stranded costs associated with the divestiture of the ace nuclear assets  the buyout of the pedricktown nug contract and the buy down of the american ref fuel nug contract 
also included in the amount authorized was million of transaction costs and capital reduction costs 
ace formed ace transition funding during as a special purpose entity spe for the sole purpose of purchasing and owning the bondable transition property btp  issuing transition bonds bonds  pledging ace transition funding s interest in btp and other collateral to the bond trustee to collateralize the bonds  and performing activities that are necessary  suitable or convenient to accomplish these purposes 
proceeds from the sale of bonds were transferred to ace in consideration for the btp  and ace will repurchase debt and or equity related to the stranded costs and nug contracts noted above 
the bonds of ace transition funding are included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
on january   ace filed a petition seeking from the njbpu an administrative valuation of a portion of the bl england station stranded costs and a finding that such costs may be included as part of the principal amount of transition bonds for which ace may seek approval under the new jersey act 
management anticipates that the necessary approvals will be received from the njbpu and that a bondable stranded costs rate petition will ultimately be approved  leading to the issuance of additional transition bonds 
rate increase on february   ace filed a petition with the njbpu to increase its electric distribution rates and the regulatory asset recovery charge in new jersey 
the request  if approved  will increase ace s annual revenues by approximately million 
the petition was filed in accordance with the njbpu s final order in restructuring  which mandated that ace file a plan to set rates that will be in place when the new jersey act s transition period ends july  pepco regulatory contingencies final briefs on pepco s district of columbia divestiture proceeds sharing application were filed on july  following an evidentiary hearing in june that application was filed to implement a provision of pepco s dc commission approved divestiture settlement that provided for a sharing of any net proceeds from the sale of its generation related assets 
a principal issue in the case is whether a sharing between customers and shareholders of the excess deferred income taxes and accumulated deferred investment tax credits associated with the sold assets would violate the normalization provisions of the internal revenue code and implementing regulations 
on march   the internal revenue service irs issued a notice of proposed rulemaking nopr that could be relevant to that principal issue 
comments on the nopr must be filed by june   and the irs will hold a public hearing on june  pepco cannot predict whether th e irs will adopt the regulations as proposed  make changes before issuing final regulations or decide not to adopt regulations 
other issues deal with the inclusion of internal costs and cost allocations 
pepco believes that its calculation of the customers share of divestiture proceeds is correct 
however  the potential exists that pepco could be required to make additional gain sharing payments to dc customers 
such additional payments  which cannot be estimated  would be charged to expense and could have a material adverse effect on results of operations in the quarter and year in which a decision is rendered  however  pepco does not believe that additional payments  if any  will have a material adverse impact on its financial position 
it is impossible to predict when the dc commission will issue a decision 
pepco filed its divestiture proceeds plan application in maryland in april reply briefs were filed in may and pepco is awaiting a proposed order from the hearing examiner 
it is a certainty that some party or parties will appeal the hearing examiner s proposed order to the maryland commission 
the principal issue in the case is the same normalization issue that was raised in the dc case 
on march   the irs issued a nopr that could be relevant to that principal issue 
comments on the nopr must be filed by june   and the irs will hold a public hearing on june  pepco cannot predict whether the irs will adopt the regulations as proposed  make changes before issuing final regulations or decide not to adopt regulations 
other issues deal with the inclusion of internal costs and cost allocations 
pepco believes that its calculation of the customers share of divestiture proceeds is correct 
however  the potential als o exists that pepco would be required to make additional gain sharing payments to maryland customers 
such additional payments  which cannot be estimated  would be charged to expense and could have a material adverse effect on results of operations in the quarter and year in which a decision is rendered  however  pepco does not believe that additional payments  if any  will have a material adverse impact on its financial position 
it is impossible to predict when the hearing examiner or the maryland commission will issue their decisions 
in maryland  in accordance with the terms of an agreement approved by the maryland commission  customers who are unable to receive generation services from another supplier  or who do not select another supplier  are entitled to receive services from pepco until july  standard offer service or sos 
pepco has entered into a settlement in phase i of maryland case no 
to extend its provision of sos services in maryland 
the settlement is awaiting approval from the maryland commission 
the settlement provides for an extension of sos for four years for residential and small commercial customers  an extension of two years for medium sized commercial customers  and an extension of one year for large commercial customers 
the settlement provides for a policy review by the commission to consider how sos will be provided after the current extension expires 
the settlement provides for sos to be procured from the wholesale marketplace and th at pepco will be able to recover its costs of procurement and a return 
full requirements contract with mirant under a full requirements contract entered into in in connection with the purchase by mirant corporation of substantially all of pepco s electricity generation assets  mirant is obligated to supply pepco with all of the capacity and energy needed to fulfill these default service obligations at fixed prices that are lower than currently approved tariff rates that pepco charges for providing such service 
if mirant were to fail to fulfill its supply obligations  pepco would have to find alternative sources of supply at rates then prevailing 
environmental matters the company through its subsidiaries is subject to regulation with respect to the environmental effects of their operations  including air and water quality control  solid and hazardous waste disposal  and limitations on land use by various federal  regional  state  and local authorities 
federal and state statutes authorize governmental agencies to compel responsible parties to clean up certain abandoned or uncontrolled hazardous waste sites 
the company s subsidiaries may incur costs to clean up facilities found to be contaminated due to current and past disposal practices 
the company s subsidiaries liability for clean up costs is affected by the activities of these governmental agencies and private land owners  the nature of past disposal practices  the activities of others including whether they are able to contribute to clean up costs  and the scientific and other complexities involved in resolving clean up related issues including wh ether a pepco holdings subsidiary or a corporate predecessor is responsible for conditions on a particular parcel 
the company s current liabilities include approximately million as of december   for potential clean up and other costs related to sites at which a conectiv subsidiary is a potentially responsible party  alleged to be a third party contributor  or has made a decision to clean up contamination on its own property 
the accrued liability as of december   included million for remediation and other costs associated with environmental contamination that resulted from an oil release at the indian river power plant which was sold on june  and reflects the terms of a related consent agreement reached with the delaware department of natural resources and environmental control during as a result of discontinuing the second competitive bidding process for ace s fossil fuel fired generating stations  ace s anticipated million costs to clean up the deepwater gen erating station is included in the previously stated million liability 
the costs of cleaning up ace s bl england generating station have not yet been quantified but may exceed million 
the company does not expect such future costs to have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in april  epa proposed regulations addressing best technology available for minimizing environmental impact from existing power production cooling water intake structures 
the ace deepwater electric generating station s new jersey pollution discharge elimination system njpdes renewal permit  effective through september  will require a study to evaluate the efficiency of recent changes to the intake structure and other biological impact studies that will be submitted with a permit renewal application in the njpdes permit for the bl england station expired in december  but has been administratively extended  through submittal of a renewal application  and the plant continues to operate under the conditions of the existing permit until a renewal permit is issued by the new jersey department of environmental protection njdep 
a conectiv subsidiary holds a national pollution discharge elimination system npdes permit for the edge moor power plant 
studies to determine impacts on aquatic organisms by the plant s intake structures  required by the existing permit which expires in october  were completed in the results of these studies and additional site specific studies on alternative technologies are expected to determine whether changes to intake structures are required to comply with any final rule that epa adopts 
on may   ace  conectiv atlantic generation  llc cag  and the njdep entered into an administrative consent order aco to address ace s and cag s inability to procure discrete emission reductions der credits to comply with new jersey s no

on july   the njdep denied ace s request to renew a permit variance  effective through july   that authorized unit at the bl england station to burn coal containing greater than sulfur 
ace has appealed the denial 
the njdep has issued a number of stays of the denial to authorize ace to operate unit with the current fuel until may  njdep also issued addendums to the permit certificate to operate for unit authorizing trial burns of coal with a sulfur content less than 
ace is requesting an extension of the current stay of the denial and submitted final wrap up reports on the results of its test burns to njdep on january  management is not able to predict the outcome of ace s appeal  including the effects  if any  of trial burn results on njdep s position with regard to the denial or the appeal 
in february  the united states environmental protection agency usepa and njdep requested information from ace regarding the operation of coal fired boilers at ace s bl england and deepwater generating stations 
as of december  in responding to this request and numerous subsequent requests  ace has provided more than  pages of documents covering activities at bl england and deepwater since to usepa and njdep 
usepa has sought this information pursuant to its authority under clean air act section  and the ace requests are similar to those that usepa has made of other electric utilities to determine compliance with new source review nsr prevention of significant deterioration psd and non attainment nsr requirements 
similar inquiries have resulted in the filing of federal lawsuits against utilities in the south and midwest 
a number of settlements of litigation brought as a result of such inquiries alleging viola tions of nsr standards have been announced 
in january  the department of justice completed its review of the usepa s enforcement actions and concluded that the usepa has a reasonable basis on which to pursue nsr enforcement 
on december   epa published an nsr reform package including both proposed and final rules 
the proposed rule offers options for clarifying the routine maintenance  repair and replacement exclusion to the nsr rules 
it is unclear how epa s proposed reform rules will ultimately impact the on going nsr enforcement actions  however  epa officials have indicated their intention to continue with the nsr enforcement initiative targeting alleged past violations under the current rules 
ace met with epa and njdep in may to discuss nsr issues 
since then  ace entered into a confidentiality agreement with the government agencies 
the company does not believe that it has violated nsr requirements 
management cannot predict the impact of the usepa njdep inquiries or proposal on b

litigation during  pepco was served with amended complaints filed in three jurisdictions prince george s county  baltimore city and baltimore county  in separate ongoing  consolidated proceedings each denominated  in re personal injury asbestos case 
pepco and other defendants were brought into these cases on a theory of premises liability under which plaintiffs argue that pepco was negligent in not providing a safe work environment for employees or its contractors who allegedly were exposed to asbestos while working on pepco s property 
initially  a total of approximately individual plaintiffs added pepco to their complaints 
while the pleadings are not entirely clear  it appears that each plaintiff seeks million in compensatory damages and million in punitive damages from each defendant 
in a related proceeding in the baltimore city case  pepco was served  in september  with a third party complaint by owens corning fiberglass  inc owens corning alleging that owens corning was in the process of settling approximately individual asbestos related cases and seeking a judgment for contribution against pepco on the same theory of alleged negligence set forth above in the plaintiffs case 
subsequently  pittsburgh corning corp 
pittsburgh corning filed a third party complaint against pepco  seeking contribution for the same plaintiffs involved in the owens corning third party complaint 
since the initial filings in  approximately additional individual suits have been filed against pepco

the amount of total liability  if any  and any related insurance recovery cannot be precisely determined at this time  however  based on information and relevant circumstances known at this time  the company does not believe these suits will have a material adverse effect on its financial position 
however  an unfavorable decision rendered against pepco could have a material adverse effect on results of operations in the year in which a decision is rendered

in late january  after several months of discussions attempting to arrive at a settlement with enron concerning the amount owed by delmarva and cesi  epmi filed an adversary complaint the complaint against cesi in the bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york 
the complaint seeks an order from the bankruptcy court that  among other things  awards damages in the amount of approximately million  plus interest and attorney s fees and additional damages in an amount to be determined at trial  declares unenforceable the provision s of the master power purchase and sale agreement mppsa between cesi and epmi that permitted cesi to set off against any amounts cesi owes epmi under the mppsa any amounts due by epmi or any of its affiliates to cesi or any of its affiliates under any agreements among epmi or any of its affiliates and cesi and any of its affiliates  and declares that the arbitration provision in the mppsa should not be enforced 
cesi disagrees with enron s calculation of the amount due cesi s calculations result in an amount due of approximately million and believes that enron s other claims are without merit 
cesi s response to the complaint is due on april  at the present time  it is not possible to predict the outcome of this suit or to estimate with specificity the amount that cesi will ultimately pay enron  however  based on  among other factors  the specific provisions in the applicable contracts of the conectiv subsidiaries with enron and applicable legal principles  management does not believe that the company has material financial exposure related to the enron bankruptcy 
the company  through its subsidiaries  is involved in other legal and administrative including environmental proceedings before various courts and agencies with respect to matters arising in the ordinary course of business

critical accounting policies the us securities and exchange commission sec has defined a company s most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on this definition  pepco has identified the critical accounting policies and judgments as addressed below 
accounting policy choices pepco s management believes that based on the nature of its business it has very little choice regarding the accounting policies it utilize as pepco s business consists of its regulated utility operations  which are subject to the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
however  in the areas that pepco is afforded accounting policy choices  management does not believe that the application of different accounting policies than those that it chose would materially impact its financial position or results of operations 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  such as statement of position disclosure of certain significant risks and uncertainties  requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
examples of estimates used by the company include the calculation of the allowance for uncollectible accounts  environmental remediation costs and anticipated collections  unbilled revenue  and pension assumptions 
pepco believes that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable  they are based upon information presently available 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates 
revenue recognition pepco s revenue for services rendered but unbilled as of the end of each month is accrued and included in the accounts receivable balance on the accompanying balance sheets 
accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation based on the regulatory framework in which it has operated  pepco has historically applied  and in connection with its transmission and distribution business continues to apply  the provisions of sfas no 
sfas no 
allows regulated entities  in appropriate circumstances  to establish regulatory assets and to defer the income statement impact of certain costs that are expected to be recovered in future rates 
management s assessment of the probability of recovery of regulatory assets requires judgment and interpretation of laws  regulatory commission orders  and other factors 
should existing facts or circumstances change in the future to indicate that a regulatory asset is not probable of recovery  and then the regulatory asset would be charged to earnings 
pension and other post employment benefit plans pepco holdings has a noncontributory retirement plan the plan that covers substantially all employees of pepco  dpl  ace  and certain employees of other pepco holdings subsidiaries 
following the consummation of the acquisition of conectiv by pepco on august   the pepco general retirement plan and the conectiv retirement plan were merged into the plan on december  the provisions and benefits of the merged plan for pepco employees are identical to those of the original pepco plan and for dpl and ace employees the provisions and benefits are identical to the original conectiv plan 
in addition to providing pension benefits  pepco holdings also provides certain health care and life insurance benefits for eligible employees opebs 
the company accounts for the plan in accordance with sfas no

sfas no 
had required that material gains and losses on extinguishment of debt be classified as an extraordinary item 
under sfas no 
 sfas no 
is rescinded effective for fiscal years beginning after may  due to the rescission of sfas no 
 it is less likely that a gain or loss on extinguishment of debt would be classified as an extraordinary item in pepco s consolidated statements of income 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 which requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when the costs are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
the primary effect of applying sfas no 
will be on the timing of recognition of costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
in many cases  those costs will be recognized as liabilities in periods following a commitment to a plan  not at the date of the commitment 
sfas no 
is to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after december  in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no

a principal issue in the case is whether a sharing between customers and shareholders of the excess deferred income taxes and accumulated deferred investment tax credits associated with the sold assets would violate the normalization provisions of the internal revenue code and implementing regulations

pepco filed its divestiture proceeds plan application in maryland in april reply briefs were filed in may and pepco is awaiting a proposed order from the hearing examiner 
it is a certainty that some party or parties will appeal the hearing examiner s proposed order to the maryland commission 
the principal issue in the case is the same normalization issue that was raised in the dc case 
on march   the irs issued a nopr that could be relevant to that principal issue 
comments on the nopr must be filed by june   and the irs will hold a public hearing on june  pepco cannot predict whether the irs will adopt the regulations as proposed  make changes before issuing final regulations or decide not to adopt regulations

the site was operated as a hazardous waste disposal  recycling  and processing facility from to in august  pepco entered into a consent decree for de minimis parties with epa to resolve its liability at this site 
pursuant to the consent decree  in return for a de minimis payment by pepco to the united states and a group of prps  those parties covenant not to sue pepco for past and future costs of remediation at the site and the united states will also provide contribution protection against third party claims related to response actions at the site 
natural resource damages  if any  are not covered by the consent decree 
court approval of the consent decree is pending 
pepco believes that its liability at this site  pursuant to the terms of the consent decree  will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations

the epa issued an npdes permit for this facility in november pepco has filed a petition with the epa environmental appeals board seeking review and reconsideration of certain provisions of the epa s permit determination 
in may  pepco and the epa reached a settlement on pepco s petition  pursuant to which the epa withdrew certain contested provisions of the permit and agreed to issue a revised draft permit for public comment 
as of december   the epa has not issued a revised permit and pepco is operating pursuant to the november permit absent the withdrawn conditions in accordance with the settlement agreement 
litigation during  pepco was served with amended complaints filed in three jurisdictions prince george s county  baltimore city and baltimore county  in separate ongoing  consolidated proceedings each denominated  in re personal injury asbestos case 
pepco and other defendants were brought into these cases on a theory of premises liability under which plaintiffs argue that pepco was negligent in not providing a safe work environment for employees or its contractors who allegedly were exposed to asbestos while working on pepco s property 
initially  a total of approximately individual plaintiffs added pepco to their complaints 
while the pleadings are not entirely clear  it appears that each plaintiff seeks million in compensatory damages and million in punitive damages from each defendant 
in a related proceeding in the baltimore city case  pepco was served  in september  with a third party complaint by owens corning fibergl ass  inc owens corning alleging that owens corning was in the process of settling approximately individual asbestos related cases and seeking a judgment for contribution against pepco on the same theory of alleged negligence set forth above in the plaintiffs case 
subsequently  pittsburgh corning corp 
pittsburgh corning filed a third party complaint against pepco  seeking contribution for the same plaintiffs involved in the owens corning third party complaint 
since the initial filings in  approximately additional individual suits have been filed against pepco 
the third party complaints involving pittsburgh corning and owens corning were dismissed by the baltimore city court during without any payment by pepco 
as of december   approximately cases were pending against pepco 
of the remaining asbestos cases pending against pepco  approximately of those cases have been tendered to mirant for defense and indemnification pursuant to the asset purchase and sale agr eement which was executed in december while the aggregate amount specified in the remaining suits would exceed million  pepco believes the amounts are greatly exaggerated  as were the claims already disposed of 
the amount of total liability  if any  and any related insurance recovery cannot be precisely determined at this time  however  based on information and relevant circumstances known at this time  pepco does not believe these suits will have a material adverse effect on its financial position 
however  an unfavorable decision rendered against pepco could have a material adverse effect on results of operations in the year in which a decision is rendered 
on april   approximately  gallons of oil leaked from a pipeline at a generation station that was owned by pepco at chalk point in aquasco  maryland
