item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business environment the boston beer company is engaged in the business of brewing and selling malt beverages and cider products primarily in the domestic market and  to a lesser extent  in selected international markets 
the alcoholic beverage industry is highly regulated at the federal  state and local levels 
the federal treasury department s alcohol and tax and trade bureau ttb and the justice department s bureau of alcohol  tobacco  firearms and explosives enforce laws under the federal alcohol administration act 
the ttb is responsible for administering and enforcing excise tax laws that directly affect the company s results of operations 
state and regulatory authorities have the ability to suspend or revoke the company s licenses and permits or impose substantial fines for violations 
the company has established strict guidelines in efforts to ensure compliance with all state and federal laws 
however  the loss or revocation of any existing license or permit could have a material effect on the company s business  results of operations  cash flows and financial position 
the company s traditional beer products compete in what the company defines as the better beer category 
the defining factors for better beer include price  quality  image and taste 
the category includes imports and domestic craft beers 
the company prices its beers at a premium as compared to domestic mass produced beers  consistent with beers in the better beer category 
the company believes that this pricing is appropriate given the quality and reputation of its core brands  while realizing that economic pricing pressures may affect future pricing levels 
in addition  the company produces products that are positioned in the hard cider and the malternative beverage segment of alcoholic beverages 
the better beer category is highly competitive due to the recent gains in market share achieved by imported beers and the large number of craft brewers  and the recent arrival of major spirits branded malternatives with similar pricing and target consumers to those of the better beers 
certain major domestic brewers have also developed niche brands and are acquiring interests in craft beers 
import brewers and major domestic brewers are able to compete more aggressively as they have substantially greater resources  marketing strength and distribution networks than the company 
as larger import and domestic brewers support their products with extensive advertising and promotions  the company has experienced increased competition 
although the domestic craft beer industry has recently experienced some consolidation  the company anticipates competition to remain strong as brewers retrench and focus their marketing efforts on their local key markets and core brands 
this competitive environment has affected the company s overall performance within the better beer category 
as the market matures and the better beer category continues to consolidate  the company believes that companies that are well positioned in terms of brand equity  marketing and distribution will prosper 
with approximately distributors nationwide and the company s approximately salespeople  a commitment to maintaining brand equity  and the quality of its beer  the company believes it is well positioned to compete in a maturing market 
the company operates with the strategy of both contract brewing  which utilizes the excess capacity of other breweries  and with brewing at its own breweries 
this strategy provides the company with flexibility in addition to quality and cost advantages 
the company follows strict guidelines in selecting the appropriate brewery and monitoring the production process in order to ensure that quality and control standards are attained 
as part of this strategy  the company owns a brewery in cincinnati  ohio 
in  the company brewed over of the company s products at the cincinnati brewery and less than at non company owned contract breweries 
the company believes that it will have adequate capacity for the production of its products for the foreseeable future 
the economics of this capacity may change as supply and demand for contract capacity changes 
as the economics and availability of contract brewing capacity changes over time  the company will continually evaluate the tradeoff between brewery ownership and contract brewing 
refer to brewing strategy under part i  item i 
the demand for the company s products is subject to changes in consumers tastes 
since the company began brewing beer  consumers preferences have shifted towards more flavorful  higher quality beers  thereby increasing the demand for better beer products 
the company s product strategy is in line with 
table of contents this trend 
the company cannot predict whether the trend toward full bodied  more flavorful beers will continue 
a change in consumer tastes or in the demand for better beer products may affect the company s future results of operations  cash flows and financial position 
the company s future results of operations  cash flows  and financial position may also be affected by the increased activity in the malternative category that may significantly change the competitive landscape due to  among other factors  the arrival of large spirits companies into the beer business  the wide spread advertising of malt based spirits brands  and wholesalers having more brands on which to focus 
results of operations boston beer s flagship product is samuel adams boston lager 
for purposes of this discussion  boston beer s core brands include all products sold under the samuel adams  hardcore and twisted tea trademarks

during the first six months of  wholesaler inventories increased by over  barrels and wholesaler inventories as of the end of were  barrels higher than at the start of the company does not foresee a similar inventory build occurring in  both because of the higher starting inventory and the apparent current reluctance on the part of wholesalers to build inventory 
wholesaler reported depletion volume  ie wholesaler sales to retailers  grew during the first two months of by approximately  a rate below that expected by the company 
while the actual reasons for this slower than expected growth are as yet unclear  it could have been caused by any of a number of factors  including brand strength  the economy  poor weather conditions  or a combination of factors 
if current depletion trends continue  shipments in the first six months of could range between down by approximately and up by approximately 
core shipments in the quarter ending march  are expected to be down between and from first quarter shipments 
actual volume results may differ  however  and no inferences should be drawn with respect to shipments or depletions in future periods 
non core volume decreased by  barrels to approximately  barrels for the year ended december  from  barrels for the year ended december  the decline in non core volume is primarily due to the expiration in june of the production contract with the company s largest customer of non core products

the company s accounting policy for hops inventory and purchase commitments is to recognize a loss by establishing a reserve to the extent inventory levels and commitments exceed forecasted usage requirements 
the computation of the excess hop inventory and purchase commitment reserve is based on the age of the hops on hand and requires management to make certain assumptions regarding future sales growth  product mix  cancellation costs  and supply  among others

the potential impact of known facts  commitments  events and uncertainties brewery related transactions during the fourth quarter of  miller brewing company filed with the american arbitration association a demand for arbitration with respect to its legal right to terminate its obligation to continue production for the company after may  in its response  the company  in addition to denying that miller has the right to terminate  also asserted certain counterclaims against miller 
selection of the arbitrators has not yet been completed and discovery has not yet commenced 
accordingly  it is not possible to predict the actual outcome of the arbitration 
miller has also notified the company of its intention to close the tumwater brewery as of july  based on ongoing discussions with miller  the company believes that the tumwater production will be moved to the eden brewery  with miller assuming the cost of the incremental freight to the areas previously supplied by the tumwater brewery 
the company believes that  regardless of the outcome of the arbitration  it will be able to maintain sources of supply adequate to meet the expected demand for the company s products beyond may however  the company is unable at this time to quantify any additional costs  capital or operating  if any  that it might incur in securing access to such capacity and ensuring that its products are produced to its quality and service requirements 
in april  the company and high falls brewing company  llc renegotiated their existing contract brewing agreement  restructuring certain pricing terms  volume requirements  termination provisions and other matters 
the new agreement extends the company s option to produce at high falls through  at slightly less favorable economics than had existed previously 
in connection with this new agreement  the company released the guaranty by the genesee brewing company  inc of the obligations of high falls 
hops purchase commitments the company utilizes several varieties of hops in the production of its products 
to ensure adequate supplies of these varieties  the company enters into advance multi year purchase commitments based on forecasted future hops requirements  among other factors 
during  the company entered into several hops future contracts  in the normal course of business 
the total value of the contracts entered into as of december  was million 
the contract agreements were deemed necessary in order to bring hops inventory levels and future contracts into balance with the company s current brewing volume and hops usage forecasts 
in addition  these new contracts enabled the company to secure its position for future supply with hops vendors in the face of some competitive buying activity 
during  the company completed certain hops disposal transactions and cancelled certain hops future contracts 
the disposal transactions were completed in order to bring aging hops inventory levels to a minimum and the contract cancellations were to reduce future contracts of certain hops varieties 
this resulted in a current and future inventory balance in line with the company s current forecasted brewing volume and hops usage  as the company did not believe that those hops inventories and future hops contracts would be used by the company within the foreseeable future 
the total charge incurred during related to the disposal of hops inventories was approximately million 
the total charge recorded during and  net of recoveries  related to the reserve for excess hops inventory and fees 
table of contents associated with the cancellation of contracts was approximately  in each year

the company continues to manage inventory levels and purchase commitments in an effort to maximize utilization of hops on hand and hops under commitment 
the company s accounting policy for hops inventory and purchase commitments is to recognize a loss by establishing a reserve to the extent inventory levels and commitments exceed forecasted needs as well as aged hops as determined by the company s brew masters 
the company will continue to manage hops inventory and contract levels  as necessary 
the current levels are deemed adequate  based upon foreseeable future brewing requirements 
the company does not anticipate further material losses related to hops inventories or contract commitments within the foreseeable future

will not have a material effect on its results of operations or financial condition 
other risks and uncertainties changes in general economic conditions could result in numerous events that may have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  cash flows and financial position 
numerous factors that could adversely affect the company s operating income  cash flows and financial position  include  but are not limited to  a slowing of the growth rate of the better beer category  share of market erosion of samuel adams boston lager and seasonal beers due to increased competition and further cannibalization resulting from the rollout of sam adams light  more rapid decline than anticipated in other samuel adams year round styles  an unexpected decline in the brewing capacity available to the company  increased advertising and promotional expenditures that are not followed by higher sales volume  higher than planned costs of operating the cincinnati brewery  higher than planned costs of operating under contract arrangement at non company owned breweries  the outcome of the pending miller arbitration  the changes in economics and feasibility of using recycled glass  adverse fluctuations in raw material or packaging costs which cannot be passed along through increased prices  world hops market conditions affecting the company s ability to buy or sell hops or cancel excess hops commitments  poor weather conditions  resulting in an inadequate supply of raw materials that are agriculturally grown  particularly the united states and canadian barley crop  which if poor  would result in significantly increased barley costs and therefore barley malt costs  adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  changes in control or ownership of the current distribution network which leads to less support of the company s products  increases in the costs of distribution  and increases in the costs associated with packaging materials due to uncontrollable changes in the bottle redemption process 
the company continues to brew its samuel adams boston lager at each of its brewing facilities  but at any particular time may rely on only one supplier for its products other than samuel adams boston lager 
the company believes that it has sufficient capacity options that would allow for a shift in production locations if necessary  although it is unable to quantify any additional costs  capital or operating  if any  that it might incur in securing access to such capacity 
in the event of a labor dispute  governmental action  a sudden closure of one of the contract breweries or other events that would prevent either the cincinnati brewery or any of the contract breweries from producing the company s beer  management believes that it would be able to shift production between breweries so as to meet demand for its beer 
in such event  however  the company could experience temporary shortfalls in production and or increased production or distribution costs  the combination of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  cash flows and financial position 
as the number of available contract breweries declines  the risks of the above disruption increases  and the structure of the brewery strategy ownership versus contracting changes 
depending on the outcome of the arbitration proceedings with miller  the number of breweries and the capacity available to the company may decline such that the current redundancy of capacity is not available to the company 
the company continually evaluates these factors and others in its evaluation of ownership versus contracting 
historically  the company has not experienced material difficulties in obtaining timely delivery from its suppliers 
although the company believes that there are alternate sources available for the ingredients and packaging materials  there can be no assurance that the company would be able to acquire such ingredients or packaging materials from substitute sources on a timely or cost effective basis in the event that current suppliers could not adequately fulfill orders 
the loss of a supplier could  in the short term  adversely affect the company s results of operations  cash flows and financial position until alternative supply arrangements were secured 
hops and malt are agricultural products and therefore many outside factors  including weather conditions  crop production  government regulations and legislation affecting agriculture  could affect both price and supply
