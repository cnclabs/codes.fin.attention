for additional information relating to our business segments and operations  please see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this annual report 
the corporate acquisitions that have been completed by us over the past three years have made our results of operations not directly comparable year over year due to a full months of operation results not being included in prior fiscal years  as well as the increase in amortization for the corporate acquisitions 
the acquisition of phoenix eps inc and check technologies inc  which were completed in fiscal year  were not included in our results of operations until july in a separate business segment  we owned and managed a acre manufactured home retirement property known as wildwood estates  in wildwood  florida 
operations included the sale of manufactured homes and lots 
in exchange for monthly maintenance fees  we provided the resident community with certain amenities and services commonly associated with similar developments 
subsequent to the year ended march   we sold the wildwood estates property for total gross proceeds of approximately million cash 
results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenue our revenue consists primarily of fees from our primary and secondary check collection  electronic check authorization  electronic check conversion and transaction switching business 
revenue is recognized in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition 
revenue from our electronic check authorization  electronic check conversion and transaction switching business is recognized at the time the transactions are processed by the merchant  provided the fee is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
fees associated with our primary and secondary check collection business are contingent on successful recovery  accordingly  revenue is recognized as cash is received 
in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  we recognize software license revenue when all of the following criteria are met execution of a written agreement  delivery of software  the license fee is fixed and determinable  collectability of the proceeds is probable  and vendor specific objective evidence exists to allocate the total fee to elements of multiple element arrangements  including post contract customer support 
vendor specific objective evidence is based on the price charged when an element is sold separately  or if not yet sold separately  the price established by authorized management or a substantive renewal rate for post contract customer support 
if we do not have sufficient evidence of the fair value of undelivered elements  revenue is recognized ratably over the support period when the undelivered element is post contract customer support 
any cash consideration received prior to meeting revenue recognition criteria is recorded as deferred revenue 
revenue regarding wildwood estates was recognized when sales of property lots and mobile homes were completed 
maintenance fees from the management of the property and from the maintenance of the common areas were recognized straight line over the service period 
during the year ended march   we granted a personal non exclusive  non transferable  limited sub license under our intellectual property estate regarding the processing of electronic check transactions to a third party payment processor 
the agreement involved an initial license fee  in addition to a separate running royalty fee based upon future electronic check transactions processed by the licensee 
revenue from the initial license fee has been deferred and is expected to be recognized over the life of the agreement 
the running royalty fee is being recognized on a monthly basis 
during the year ended march   jc penney  one of our largest customers and responsible for approximately of total revenue in the year ended  sought bids from us and other financial payment processing service providers to provide both a new  centralized return service  and an electronic check recovery service  one of the services provided by us to jc penney 
ultimately  we were unsuccessful in our bid for these services and by the conclusion of our third quarter of fiscal we no longer provided these services to jc penney 
as a result  electronic check recovery service revenue received form jc penney decreased from approximately  in fiscal to approximately  in fiscal year we are continuing to provide primary collections and other services to this customer which resulted in revenue of approximately  in fiscal as compared to approximately million in fiscal on march   fleming retail group fleming  one of our customers we currently provide transaction switching services to  filed for chapter reorganization in the united states bankruptcy court 
fleming recently notified us of its intention to commence closing and selling their remaining grocery retail store locations 
consequently  we believe the transaction switching services currently provided by us to fleming may no longer be required and  therefore  the resulting impact on future revenue could be a reduction of approximately  per year or approximately of our total revenue 
total revenue for fiscal year was approximately million  approximately a decrease over total revenue of approximately million for fiscal year this decrease is primarily the result of reductions in revenue from our primary and secondary check collections business 
revenue from our primary check collections business decreased approximately from approximately million for fiscal year to approximately million for fiscal year revenue from our secondary check collections business decreased approximately from approximately million for fiscal year to approximately million for fiscal year we believe the reductions in revenue from our primary and secondary check collections business is partially a result of us no longer providing electronic check recovery services for one of our largest customers and partially a result of softer consumer spending trends throughout fiscal year revenue from electronic check verification increased ap proximately from approximately million for fiscal year to approximately million for fiscal year the increase is mainly attributable to the rollout of check processing services  including electronic check verification  to multi lane grocery stores with locations in the houston  texas area during the third quarter of fiscal year revenue from the licensing of certain modules of our software increased approximately  for the year ended march  the increases in electronic check verification revenue and software licensing revenue is consistent with our strategic objective of acquiring electronic payment volume across all our financial payment processing services and strengthening our position as a financial payment processor 
revenue relating to wildwood estates increased approximately from approximately  in fiscal year to approximately  for fiscal year costs of operations costs of operations decreased from approximately million in fiscal year to approximately million in fiscal year  a decrease of approximately 
financial payment processing costs of operations decreased approximately from approximately million in fiscal year to approximately million for fiscal year the decrease was principally attributable to our implementation of electronic check recovery methods which allowed us to migrate from labor intensive traditional check recovery methods to more cost efficient electronic check recovery methods 
costs of operations consist of transaction processing costs  personnel costs  equipment related costs and telecommunication costs 
for fiscal year  costs of operations as a percentage of revenue decreased to approximately compared to approximately for fiscal year financial payment processing costs of operations were approximately million in the first quarter  approximately million i n the second quarter  approximately million in the third quarter and approximately million in the fouth quarter 
we continue to seek ways to reduce costs of operations 
costs of operations related to wildwood estates increased approximately from approximately  in fiscal year to approximately  for fiscal year sales  general and administrative expenses sales  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  commissions  office facilities  travel  promotional events such as trade shows  seminars and technical conferences and public relations 
sales  general and administrative expenses decreased from approximately million in fiscal year to approximately million in fiscal year  a decrease of approximately 
the decrease in sales  general and administrative expenses are principally attributable to lower costs associated with the reduction of personnel costs  legal and general corporate expenses 
for fiscal year  sales  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to approximately compared to approximately for fiscal year amortization and depreciation amortization on goodwill and other intangibles decreased to approximately  for fiscal year from approximately million for fiscal year depreciation expenses relating to our system software and other software increased to approximately million for fiscal year from approximately million for fiscal year the decrease in amortization of goodwill and other intangibles is associated with our adoption of the provisions of cica and sfas which no longer subject goodwill to amortization over its estimated useful life 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we completed our first fair value based impairment tests and recorded a one time non cash charge of approximately million to write off the carrying value of goodwill 
amortization of goodwill for fiscal year was approximately  depreciation expense for capital assets decreased to approximately  for fiscal year from approximately  for fiscal yea r the decrease was primarily attributable to certain capital assets  which were acquired through previous years acquisitions  becoming fully depreciated during fiscal year other expenses income in fiscal year  we had other expenses of approximately  compared to other income of approximately  in fiscal year other expenses were mainly attributed to foreign exchange losses from cash and cash equivalents held in canadian currency 
other income in fiscal year was attributed to the reconciliation of outstanding trade payables  which was a non cash item of approximately  an employee tax refund of approximately  offset by merger costs of approximately  interest interest expense increased to approximately  in fiscal year from approximately  in fiscal year interest income for fiscal year decreased to approximately  from approximately  for fiscal year the decrease in interest income was primarily attributed to a decrease in funds placed in term deposits or short term commercial paper  as well as the decrease in interest rates from an average of approximately in fiscal year to approximately in fiscal year income taxes we regularly evaluate the realizability of our future tax assets given the nature of our operations and given the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
at this time  we consider it more likely than not that the future tax assets will not be realized through future taxable income 
accordingly  the future tax asset is reserved in full as of march  net loss net loss was approximately million for fiscal year and approximately million for fiscal year loss per both basic and diluted shares was approximately in fiscal year  as compared to approximately for fiscal year fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenue total revenue for fiscal year was approximately million  approximately a decrease over revenue of approximately million for fiscal year this decrease is primarily the result of our plan to move away from licensing our retail electronic payment system software directly to clients and implementing a centralized data center processing model which operates our retail electronic payment system and provides clients with transaction based services rather than software licenses 
although this has caused a short term decrease in revenue  it is expected to increase revenue in the long term

for fiscal year  costs of operations as a percentage of revenue increased to approximately compared to approximately for fiscal year beginning near the end of the second quarter of fiscal year  we began to initiate electronic check re presentment on behalf of many of our clients for whom we had been performing traditional colle ction services 
the implementation of the more cost efficient electronic check re presentment methods from our data center resulted in a reduction of costs of operations primarily in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year financial payment processing costs of operations were approximately million in the first quarter  approximately million in the second quarter  approximately million in the third quarter and approximately million in the fourth quarter 
we continue to seek ways to reduce costs of operations

accordingly  the future tax asset is reserved in full as of march  net loss net loss was approximately million for fiscal year and approximately million for fiscal year loss per both basic and diluted shares was approximately in fiscal year  as compared to approximately for fiscal year subsequent events subsequent to the year ended march   we received notification of the issuance of us patent no 
 this patent addresses electronic check processing and relates to existing us patent nos 
   and  subsequent to the year ended march   our wholly owned subsidiary  lhtw properties inc  sold the wildwood estates property for total gross proceeds of approximately million cash

cash provided by financing activities was approximately  for fiscal year as compared to cash used in financing of approximately  for fiscal year the increase in cash provided by financing activities is primarily due to the increase in proceeds from exercise of options of our common stock in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year we believe that existing cash and cash equivalent balances  and potential cash flows from operations should satisfy our working capital and capital expenditure requirements in the foreseeable future 
however  any material acquisitions of complementary businesses  products or technologies  other arrangements  unexpected losses  or a further economic slowdown in the retail industry could require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing 
there can be no assurance that such financing would be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the following accounting policies involve a higher degree of complexity and warrant specific description 
revenue recognition transaction processing and service fees are recognized in the period these services are performed 
these services consist of processing our clients electronic check authorization and conversion transactions 
these fees are charged on a per transactions basis and depend upon the contractual agreement with the client 
check recovery fees are recognized in the period when cash is received for the services performed 
these services typically consist of recovering the face amount of the original transaction and a service or collection fee 
we are typically paid the service fee only when we are successful in the recovery of the face amount of the original transaction on behalf of our client 
in cases where our clients are of sufficient size and possess the technical capability to process transactions on their own  we license certain elements of our modules of our electronic payment processing software 
we are typically paid either a fixed license fee which is recognized in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition or in some cases a fee per transaction processed by the client whereupon revenue is recognized at the time the transactions are processed  provided the fee is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
license fees regarding the licensing of the technology embodied within our five us patents regarding electronic check processing are recognized in the period earned 
in some instances  our licensees have paid an up front fee to obtain a license  and in such cases the up front fee is treated as deferred revenue and is recognized over the life of the agreement 
running royalties earned from electronic check transactions processed by the licensee are recognized on a monthly basis 
we receive fixed maintenance fees from residents who live at our wildwood estates property in return for the maintenance of common areas and associated services 
we recognize maintenance fees over the service period 
valuation of other long lived assets we regularly evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred which indicate that the carrying amounts of our other long lived assets  primarily our patents and our transactions processing software  equipment and other intangible assets  may warrant revision or may not be recoverable 
when there are indications that such assets should be evaluated for possible impairment  we perform an impairment test in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
in the opinion of management  our long lived assets are appropriately valued as of march  and stock based compensation we issue stock options to our employees and directors under the terms of our stock option plan and our stock incentive plan 
canadian generally accepted accounting principles provide two alternative methods of accounting for stock options under the terms and conditions we typically issue such options 
one alternative is to estimate the fair value of the stock option on the date of grant and recognize that value as an expense to operations over the option s vesting period 
the other option currently available to our corporation is to estimate the fair value of the option on the date of grant but only reflect the impact in a pro forma disclosure setting forth compensation expense as if the fair value method was used in the corporation s financial statements and forego adjusting the consolidated statement of operations 
the method a corporation chooses to apply is a matter of policy 
consistent with our past practices  we utilize the second of these options and reflect the impact of the com pensation expense in a pro forma disclosure to our financial statements 
as illustrated in note b to the financial statements  were we to change our accounting policy on this matter to reflect the expense in our consolidated statement of operations  or should canadian generally accepted accounting principles change to require us to reflect this expense in our consolidated statement of operations  our results would be materially and adversely affected 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not currently have any off balance sheet arrangements as such term is defined in item a of regulation s k 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas  which amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas to provide alternative methods of transition to sfas fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas also amends the disclosure provisions of sfas and apb opinion no 
interim financial reporting to require disclosure in the summary of significant accounting policies of the effects of a corporation s accounting policy with respect to stock based employee compensation on reported net income and earnings per share in the annual and interim financial statements 
we have implemented the required disclosures of sfas in the audited consolidated financial statements see note b to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
this statement requires corporations to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
sfas no 
is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  we do not believe that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our financial position or consolidated statement of operations 
in november   the eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf issue no 

eitf issue no 
provides guidance on how to account for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services and or rights to use assets 
the provisions of eitf no 
will apply to revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  we do not believe that the adoption of eitf issue no 
will have a material effect on our consolidated statement of operations 
summary quarterly financial data unaudited the following summarizes our unaudited quarterly financial results for the fiscal years ended march  and march  in thousands  except share data year ended march  first second third fourth quarter quarter quarter quarter net revenue net loss basic net loss per common share diluted net loss per common share year ended march  first second third fourth quarter quarter quarter quarter net revenues net loss basic net loss per common share diluted net loss per common share item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in marketable securities which consist of money market and commercial paper 
at march   our marketable securities were recorded at a fair value of approximately million  with an overall weighted average return of and an overall weighted average life of less than three months 
our marketable securities have exposure to price risk  which is estimated as the potential loss in fair value due to a hypothetical change of basis points of our overall average return on marketable securities in quoted market prices 
this hypothetical change would have an immaterial effect on the recorded value of the marketable securities 
we are not exposed to material future earnings or cash flow fluctuations from changes in interest rates on long term debt since of our long term debt is at a fixed rate as of march  the fair value of our debt approximates its carrying value 
to date  we have not entered into any derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk and are currently not evaluating the future use of any such financial instruments 
we have immaterial exposure to foreign currency transaction gains or losses 
to date  we have not entered into any derivative financial instrument to manage foreign currency risk and are currently not evaluating the future use of any such financial instruments
