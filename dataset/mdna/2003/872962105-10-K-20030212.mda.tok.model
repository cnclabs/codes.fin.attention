goodwill effective january   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
upon the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill is no longer subject to amortization 
goodwill is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  goodwill is considered to be impaired 
we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining balance of goodwill may not be recoverable 
in evaluating impairment  we estimate the sum of the expected future cash flows derived from such goodwill 
such evaluations for impairment are significantly impacted by estimates of future revenues  costs and expenses and other factors 
if the goodwill is considered to be impaired  the impairment loss to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the fair value of the expected future cash flows 
impairment of long lived assets housing projects and land lots under development are stated at the lower of costs or net realizable value 
property and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation 
we assess these assets for impairment in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
requires that long lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in 
table of contents circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
these evaluations for impairment are significantly impacted by estimates of revenues  costs and expenses and other factors 
if these assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment loss to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets

lot option contracts we enter into option contracts with land sellers and third party financial entities as a method of acquiring developed lots 
from time to time to leverage our ability to acquire and finance the development of these lots  we transfer our option right to third parties 
option contracts generally require the payment of a non refundable cash deposit or the issuance of a letter of credit for the right to acquire lots over a specified period of time at predetermined prices 
typically  our deposits or letter of credit are less than of the option price 
we generally have the right at our discretion to terminate our obligations under these option agreements by forfeiting our cash deposit or repaying amounts drawn under the letter of credit with no further financial responsibility 
we do not have legal title to these assets 
additionally  we do not have an investment in the third party acquirer and do not guarantee their liabilities 
however  if certain conditions are met  including the deposit and or letters of credit exceeding certain significance levels as compared to the remaining lots under the option contract  we will include the lots in inventory with a corresponding liability in consolidated land bank obligations 
warranty reserves in the normal course of business we will incur warranty related costs associated with homes which have previously closed 
warranty reserves are established by charging cost of sales and recognizing a liability for the estimated warranty costs for each home that is closed 
we monitor this reserve on a monthly basis by evaluating the historical warranty experience in each market in which we operate and the reserve is adjusted as appropriate for current quantitative and qualitative factors 
actual future warranty costs could differ from our currently estimated amounts

home closings decreased to  during fiscal year from  during fiscal year the decrease in home closings and revenue from home sales was primarily attributable to a decline in the number of communities in which we were actively marketing during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year and a weakening in housing demand in the texas and western regions 
these factors were partially offset by a strong housing demand in florida 
at the beginning of fiscal year  we were actively marketing in communities

consequently  at december  we were actively marketing in communities 
however  due to a lag time between the date we begin marketing homes in a community and the date that we begin to close homes  home closings from these new communities will not begin to contribute to our home sales revenue until during fiscal year  our texas region generated revenues from home sales of million on  home closings as compared to revenues of million on home closings of  during fiscal year the weakening in demand in this market also caused an increase in the level of incentives offered which is reflected in the decline in the average sales price per home closed to  during fiscal year from  during fiscal year additionally  our west region experienced a decline in revenues from home sales to million on home closings during fiscal year from million on  home closings during fiscal year the decline in revenues in the west region is primarily due to a decline in the average number of active selling communities during the first part of fiscal year  as compared to the prior year and a continued weakness in demand in our colorado markets

our sources of cash to finance these requirements have been primarily cash generated from operations and cash borrowed under our credit facilities 
our financial services segment relies primarily on internally generated funds  which include the proceeds generated from the sale of mortgages  and from the mortgage operation s warehouse line of credit to fund our operations 
at december   we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of million as compared to million at december  the decrease in unrestricted cash was primarily attributable to cash used in investing and financing activities 
our primary investing activities consisted of the cash used to fund acquisitions 
our primary financing activities consisted of the repayment of the majority of the debt existing prior to the merger with the proceeds from the june notes offering and cash on hand 
during fiscal year  we generated cash of million from our operating activities  which primarily consisted of cash generated from income from operations offset by increases in inventory as part of our strategy to increase the number of active communities and our land positions 
during fiscal year  inventory increased by million as our controlled lots increased from  to  this use of cash was partially offset by the cash generated from our sale of westbrooke during april and income generated from continuing operations 
this  along with the proceeds from our senior and senior subordinated notes as described below offering  were used to repay million in existing homebuilding borrowings and technical olympic debt assumed in the merger 
during fiscal year we generated ebitda of million as compared to million during fiscal year the decline in ebitda is primarily a result of million in severance and merger related charges incurred during fiscal year as compared to million incurred during fiscal year and a million loss on the early retirement of debt associated with our refinancing

the february senior notes were issued pursuant to an indenture with the same terms and conditions as the june senior notes 
interest on our outstanding senior notes both those issued in june and february and senior subordinated notes is payable on january and july of each year 
the senior notes are guaranteed by all of our material domestic subsidiaries 
the senior notes rank pari passu in right of payment with all of our existing and future senior debt and senior in right of payment to the senior subordinated notes and any future subordinated debt 
the senior subordinated notes rank pari passu in right of payment with all of our existing and future subordinated debt and are guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by all of our material domestic subsidiaries 
the indentures governing the senior and senior subordinated notes require us to maintain a minimum net worth and place certain restrictions on our ability  among other things  to incur additional debt  pay or make dividends or other distributions  sell assets  enter into transactions with affiliates and merge or consolidate with other entities 
the interest rates on our outstanding senior and senior subordinated notes are higher than the collective interest rates on the obligations that were repaid 
as a result of the higher interest rates and the assumption of the technical olympic debt  we anticipate that interest incurred will exceed the amounts which would have been incurred under the prior borrowings 
therefore  the increased interest incurred will have an effect on gross margins in future periods 
on june   we entered into a revolving credit facility that permits us to borrow up to the lesser of i million or ii our borrowing base calculated in accordance with the revolving credit facility agreement minus our outstanding senior debt

eurodollar loans accrue interest at a rate per annum equal to i an applicable margin plus ii the reserve adjusted eurodollar rate for the interest period 
applicable margins will be adjusted based on the ratio of our liabilities to our tangible worth 
at 
table of contents december   our loans outstanding under the revolving credit facility accrued interest at a rate of per annum 
the revolving credit facility requires us to maintain specified financial ratios regarding leverage  interest coverage  consolidated tangible net worth and certain operational measurements and satisfy certain financial condition tests 
the revolving credit facility also places certain restrictions on  among other things  our ability to incur additional debt or liens  pay or make dividends or other distributions  sell assets  enter into transactions with affiliates and merge or consolidate with other entities

to fund the origination of residential mortgage loans  our subsidiaries  preferred home mortgage company preferred home and technical mortgage  lp technical mortgage entered into a million revolving warehouse line of credit  which we refer to as our warehouse line of credit 
the warehouse line of credit is comprised of a credit facility providing for revolving loans of up to million  subject to meeting borrowing base requirements based on the value of collateral provided and mortgage loan purchase and sale agreements which provide for the purchase by the lender of up to million in mortgage loans generated by preferred home and technical mortgage 
at no time may the amount outstanding under the facility plus the amount of purchased loans pursuant to the purchase and sale agreements exceed million

the warehouse line of credit requires preferred home to maintain certain financial ratios and minimums 
the warehouse line of credit is secured by a guarantee from us and by funded mortgages which are pledged as collateral

however  there can be no assurance that the amounts available from such sources will be sufficient 
if we identify new acquisition opportunities  or if our operations do not generate sufficient cash from operations at levels currently anticipated  we may need to seek additional debt or equity financing to operate and expand our business 
maturities on homebuilding borrowings at december  are as follows dollars in thousands thereafter at december   the amount of our annual debt service payments was million 
this amount included debt service payments on the june senior notes and june senior subordinated notes of million and interest payments on the revolving credit facility and the warehouse line of credit of million based on the balances outstanding as of december  the amount of our annual debt service payments on the revolving credit facility fluctuates based on the principal outstanding under the facility and the interest rate 
an increase or decrease of in interest rates will change our annual debt service payments by million per year 
the revolving credit facility terminates in june at which time we will be required to repay all outstanding principal 
under certain circumstances  we may extend the facility in one year increments  for up to two additional years 
backlog as of december   we have  units in backlog representing million in revenue  as compared to  units in backlog representing million in revenue as of december  this increase 
table of contents in revenue in backlog of is attributable to several factors we experienced a slow down in new sales contracts during the th quarter of as a result of the effects of september th  we increased our active selling communities to as of december  as compared to as of december   and we experienced an increase in the average selling price of units in backlog to  from  this increase in the average selling price of our units in backlog relates primarily to an increase in backlog in our mid atlantic and west regions where our average selling prices are higher

we did not pay any cash dividends on our common stock in fiscal year prior to its merger with us  engle made net distributions of million during fiscal year  million during fiscal year and million during fiscal year impact of recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires the use of the purchase method of accounting and prohibits the use of the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations initiated after june  sfas also requires companies to recognize acquired intangible assets apart from goodwill if the acquired intangible assets meet certain criteria 
sfas applies to all business combinations completed on or after july  it also requires  upon adoption of sfas  that companies reclassify the carrying amounts of intangible assets and goodwill based on the criteria in sfas the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
sfas requires  among other things  that companies no longer amortize goodwill  but instead review goodwill for impairment at least annually 
sfas prescribes a two phase process for impairment testing of goodwill 
the first phase  required to be completed by june   screens for impairment 
the second phase if necessary  required to be completed by december   measures the impairment 
the impairment loss is the amount  if any  by which the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the book carrying value 
in addition  sfas requires companies to identify reporting units for the useful lives of other existing recognized intangible assets  and cease amortization of intangible assets with an indefinite useful life 
an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life should be tested for impairment in accordance with the guidance in sfas sfas is required to be applied in fiscal years beginning after december  to all goodwill and other intangible assets recognized at that date  regardless of when those assets were initially recognized 
companies are also required to reassess the useful lives of other intangible assets within the first interim quarter after adoption of sfas we adopted sfas as of january  we completed the first phase impairment analysis during the second quarter of and found no instances of impairment on our recorded goodwill 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement supersedes the rules on asset impairment under sfas no 
 accounting for long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  but retains many of our fundamental provisions 
additionally this statement expands the scope of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions 
sfas provides a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of and significantly changes the criteria that would have to be met to classify an asset as held for sale 
classification as held for sale is an important distinction since such assets are not depreciated and are stated at the lower of fair value or carrying amount 
sfas also requires expected future operating losses from discontinued operations to be displayed in the periods in which the losses are incurred  rather than as of the measurement date as previously required 
the provisions of this statement are effective for financial statements issued beginning after december  the adoption of sfas on january  did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of sfas nos 
 and  amendment of 
table of contents fasb statement no 
and technical corrections 
sfas prevents gains or losses on extinguishment of debt not meeting the criteria of apb to be treated as extraordinary 
sfas amends sfas no 
 accounting for leases  to eliminate inconsistency between the required accounting for sale leaseback transactions and the required accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar to sale leaseback transactions 
in addition  sfas rescinds sfas no 
 accounting for intangible assets of motor carriers and amends other existing authoritative pronouncements to make various technical corrections  clarify meanings or describe their applicability under changed conditions 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after may  the adoption of sfas does not have a material impact on our previously issued financial statements 
however  the adoption of sfas could impact the financial statements of subsequent periods  although it is not expected to be material 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas requires recognition of a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity when the liability is incurred as opposed to when the entity commits to an exit plan under eitf no 
sfas is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  we believe the adoption of sfas will not have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements 
interpretation no 
addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities  which have one or both of the following characteristics the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated support from other parties  which is provided through other interests that will absorb some or all of the expected losses of the entity 
the equity investors lack one or more of the following essential characteristics of a controlling financial interest a the direct or indirect ability to make decisions about the entities activities through voting rights or similar rights b the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity if they occur  which makes it possible for the entity to finance its activities c the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity if they occur  which is the compensation for the risk of absorbing the expected losses 
interpretation no 
also requires expanded disclosures by the primary beneficiary as defined of a variable interest entity and by an enterprise that holds a significant variable interest in a variable interest entity but is not the primary beneficiary 
interpretation no 
applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
it applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june   to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  interpretation no 
may be applied prospectively with a cumulative effect adjustment as of the date on which it is first applied or by restating previously issued financial statements for one or more years with a cumulative effect adjustment as of the beginning of the first year restated 
as interpretation no 
has just been issued  we have not completed our evaluation as to the potential impact on our consolidated financial statements 
however  based on our preliminary review  we do not believe that the adoption of interpretation no 
will have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements 
seasonality of operations the homebuilding industry tends to be seasonal  as generally there are more homes sold in the spring and summer months when the weather is milder  although the rate of sales contracts for new homes is highly dependent 
table of contents on the number of active communities and the timing of new community openings 
we operate primarily in the southwest and southeast  where weather conditions are more suitable to a year round construction process than in other parts of the country 
because new home closings trail new home sales by several months  we typically have a greater percentage of home closings in the fall 
inflation we and the homebuilding industry in general  may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation  primarily because of higher land and construction costs 
inflation also increases our financing  labor and material costs  which may reduce gross margins 
in addition  higher mortgage rates significantly affect the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective homebuyers 
we attempt to pass through to our customers any increases in our costs through increased sales prices 
to date  inflation has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
however  there is no assurance that it will not have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a result of the senior and senior subordinated notes offerings  million of our outstanding borrowings are based on fixed interest rates 
we are exposed to market risk primarily related to potential adverse changes in interest rates on our existing construction loan and warehouse line of credit and our revolving credit facility 
the interest rates relative to these borrowings fluctuate with the prime and eurodollar lending rates  both upwards and downwards 
as of december   we had an aggregate of approximately million drawn under our revolving credit facility and our warehouse line of credit that is subject to changes in interest rates 
an increase or decrease of in interest rates will change our annual debt service payments by million per year 
we do not enter into  or intend to enter into  derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the following table presents the future principal payment obligations and weighted average interest rates associated with our long term debt instruments assuming our actual level of long term debt indebtedness as of december  expected maturity date in thousands thereafter fair value liabilities long term debt fixed rate fixed rate revolving loan  variable rate at december  variable rate  warehouse line of credit at december  our operations are interest rate sensitive 
overall housing demand is adversely affected by increases in interest rates 
if mortgage interest rates increase significantly  this may negatively affect the ability of homebuyers to secure adequate financing 
higher interest rates will adversely affect our revenues  gross margins and net income 
higher interest rates also increase our borrowing costs because  as indicated above  our bank loans will fluctuate with the prime and eurodollar lending rates  both upwards and downwards
