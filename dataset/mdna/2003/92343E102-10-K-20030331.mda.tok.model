each of these transactions has been accounted for as a purchase and  accordingly  the results of the acquired companies operations are included in our consolidated financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition 
critical accounting policies and significant management estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  investments and long lived assets 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we derive revenues from three primary categories of services i security services  which include managed security and network services  web trust services and payment services  and registry services  
table of contents ii telecommunications services  which include connectivity  intelligent networks  wireless and clearinghouse services  and iii domain name registration services 
the revenue recognition policy for each of these categories is as follows domain name registration services domain name registration revenues consist primarily of registration fees charged to customers and registrars for domain name registration services 
revenues from the initial registration or renewal of domain name registration services are deferred and recognized ratably over the registration term  generally one to two years and up to ten years 
domain name registration renewal fees are estimated and recorded based on renewal and collection rates 
customers are notified of the expiration of their registration in advance  and we record the receivables for estimated renewal fees in the month preceding the anniversary date of their registration when we have a right to bill under the terms of our domain name registration agreements 
the variance between the actual collections and the rate used to estimate the renewal fees is reflected in the setting of renewal rates for prospective periods 
fees for renewals and advance extensions to the existing term are deferred until the new incremental period commences 
these fees are then recognized ratably over the new registration term  ranging from one to ten years 
security services and registry services revenues from the licensing of digital certificate technology and business process technology are derived from arrangements involving multiple elements including post contract customer support  or pcs  training and other services 
these licenses  which do not provide for right of return  are primarily perpetual licenses for which revenues are recognized up front once all criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
revenues from the sale or renewal of digital certificates are deferred and recognized ratably over the life of the digital certificate  generally months 
revenues from the sale of managed pki services are deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the license  generally to months 
pcs is bundled with managed pki services licenses and recognized over the license term 
we recognize revenues from issuances of digital certificates and business process licensing to verisign affiliates in accordance with sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  and generally recognize revenues when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
we define each of these four criteria as follows persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
it is our customary practice to have a written contract  which is signed by both the customer and us  or a purchase order from those customers who have previously negotiated a standard license arrangement with us 
delivery has occurred 
our software may be either physically or electronically delivered to the customer 
electronic delivery is deemed to have occurred upon download by the customer from an ftp server 
if an arrangement includes undelivered products or services that are essential to the functionality of the delivered product  delivery is not considered to have occurred until these products or services are delivered 
the fee is fixed or determinable 
it is our policy to not provide customers the right to a refund of any portion of its license fees paid 
we may agree to payment terms with a foreign customer based on local customs 
generally  at least of the arrangement fees are due within one year or less 
arrangements with payment terms extending beyond these customary payment terms are considered not to be fixed or determinable  and revenues from such arrangements are recognized as payments become due and payable 
collectibility is probable 
collectibility is assessed on a customer by customer basis 
we typically sell to customers for whom there is a history of successful collection 
new customers are subjected to a credit review process that evaluates the customer s financial position and ultimately their ability to pay 

table of contents if we determine from the outset of an arrangement that collectibility is not probable based upon our credit review process  revenues are recognized as cash is collected 
we allocate revenues on software arrangements involving multiple elements to each element based on the relative fair value of each element 
our determination of fair value of each element in multiple element arrangements is based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value  or vsoe 
we limit our assessment of vsoe for each element to the price charged when the same element is sold separately 
we have analyzed all of the elements included in our multiple element arrangements and determined that we have sufficient vsoe to allocate revenues to pcs  professional services and training components of our perpetual license arrangements 
we sell our professional services and training separately  and have established vsoe on this basis 
vsoe for pcs is determined based upon the customer s annual renewal rates for these elements 
accordingly  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met  revenues from perpetual licenses are recognized upon delivery using the residual method in accordance with sop our consulting services generally are not essential to the functionality of the software 
our software products are fully functional upon delivery and do not require any significant modification or alteration 
customers purchase these consulting services to facilitate the adoption of our technology and dedicate personnel to participate in the services being performed  but they may also decide to use their own resources or appoint other consulting service organizations to provide these services 
software products are billed separately and independently from consulting services  which are generally billed on a time and materials or milestone achieved basis 
revenues from consulting services are recognized using either the percentage of completion method or on a time and materials basis as work is performed 
percentage of completion is based upon the ratio of hours incurred to total hours estimated to be incurred for the project 
we have a history of accurately estimating project status and the hours required to complete projects 
if different conditions were to prevail such that accurate estimates could not be made  then the use of the completed contract method would be required and all revenue and costs would be deferred until the project was completed 
revenues from training are recognized as training is performed 
revenues from third party product sales are recognized when title to the products sold passes to the customer 
our shipping terms generally dictate that the passage of title occurs upon shipment of the products to the customer 
revenues from payment services primarily consist of a set up fee and a monthly service fee for the transaction processing services 
in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  revenues from set up fees are deferred and recognized ratably over the period that the fees are earned 
revenues from the service fees are recognized ratably over the periods in which the services are provided 
advance customer deposits received are deferred and allocated ratably to revenue over the periods the services are provided 
telecommunications services revenues from telecommunications services are comprised of network connectivity revenues and intelligent network services revenues  and wireless billing and customer care services 
network connectivity revenues are derived from establishing and maintaining connection to our ss network and trunk signaling services 
revenues from network connectivity consist primarily of monthly recurring fees  and trunk signaling service revenues are charged monthly based on the number of switches to which a customer signals 
the initial connection fee and related costs are deferred and recognized over the term of the arrangement 
intelligent network services  which include calling card validation  local number portability  wireless services  toll free database access and caller identification are derived primarily from database administration and database query services and are charged on a per use or per query basis 
revenues from prepaid wireless account management services and unregistered wireless roaming services are based on the revenue retained by us and recognized in the period in which such 
table of contents calls are processed on a per minute or per call basis 
revenues from wireless billing and customer care services primarily represent a monthly recurring fee for every subscriber activated by our wireless carrier customers 
clearinghouse services revenues are derived primarily from serving as a distribution and collection point for billing information and payment collection for services provided by one carrier to customers billed by another 
clearinghouse revenues are earned based on the number of messages processed 
included in prepaid expenses and other current assets are amounts from customers that are related to our telecommunications services for third party network access  data base charges and clearinghouse toll amounts that have been invoiced and remitted to the customer 
reciprocal arrangements on occasion  we have purchased goods or services for our operations from organizations at or about the same time that we licensed our software to these organizations 
these transactions are recorded at terms we consider to be fair value 
for these reciprocal arrangements  we consider accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions  and emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 interpretation of apb opinion no 
 to determine whether the arrangement is a monetary or nonmonetary transaction 
transactions involving the exchange of boot representing or greater of the fair value of the reciprocal arrangement are considered monetary transactions within the context of apb opinion no 
and eitf issue no 
monetary transactions and nonmonetary transactions that represent the culmination of an earnings process are recorded at the fair value of the products delivered or products or services received  whichever is more readily determinable  provided that fair values are determinable within reasonable limits 
in determining fair value  we consider the recent history of cash sales of the same products or services in similar sized transactions 
revenues from such transactions may be recognized over a period of time as the products or services are received 
for nonmonetary reciprocal arrangements that do not represent the culmination of the earnings process  the exchange is recorded based on the carrying value of the products delivered  which is generally zero 
in  we recognized revenues under reciprocal arrangements of approximately million  of which million involved nonmonetary transactions  as defined above 
in  we recognized revenues under reciprocal arrangements of approximately million  of which million involved nonmonetary transactions  as defined above 
we did not recognize any revenues under reciprocal arrangements in allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we regularly review the adequacy of our accounts receivable allowance after considering the size of the accounts receivable balance  each customer s expected ability to pay and our collection history with each customer 
we review significant invoices that are past due to determine if an allowance is appropriate based on the risk category using the factors described above 
in addition  we maintain a general reserve for all invoices by applying a percentage based on the age category 
we also monitor our accounts receivable for concentration to any one customer  industry or geographic region 
to date our receivables have not had any particular concentrations that  if not collected  would have a significant impact on our operating income 
we require all acquired companies to adopt our credit policies 
the allowance for doubtful accounts represents our best estimate  but changes in circumstances relating to accounts receivable may result in a requirement for additional allowances in the future 
investments we invest in debt and equity securities of technology companies for business and strategic purposes 
some of these companies are publicly traded and have highly volatile share prices 
however  in most instances  these investments are in the form of equity and debt securities of private companies for which there is no public market 
these companies are typically in the early stage of development and are expected to incur substantial 
table of contents losses in the near term 
therefore  these companies may never become publicly traded 
even if they do  an active trading market for their securities may never develop and we may never realize any return on these investments 
further  if these companies are not successful  we could incur charges related to write downs or write offs of these investments 
we review our marketable equity holdings in publicly traded companies on a regular basis to determine if any security has experienced an other than temporary decline in fair value 
we consider the investee company s cash position  earnings and revenue outlook  stock price performance over the preceding six months  liquidity and changes in management s ownership  among other factors  in our review 
if we determine that an other than temporary decline exists in a marketable equity security that is classified as available for sale  we record an investment loss in our consolidated statement of operations 
for non public companies  we review  on a quarterly basis  the assumptions underlying the operating performance and cash flow forecasts based on information requested from these privately held companies on at least a quarterly basis 
this information may be more limited  may not be as timely and may be less accurate than information available from publicly traded companies 
assessing each investment s carrying value requires significant judgment by management 
generally  if cash balances are insufficient to sustain a company s operations for a six month period  we consider the decline in it s fair value to be other than temporary 
if we determine that an other than temporary decline in fair value exists in a non public equity security  we write down the investment to its fair value and record the related write down as an investment loss in our consolidated statement of operations 
during and  we determined that the decline in value of certain of our public and non public equity investments was other than temporary and recorded write downs of these investments totaling million and million  respectively 
during we recorded no investment write downs 
valuation of long lived intangible assets including goodwill our long lived assets consist primarily of goodwill  other intangible assets and property and equipment 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such an asset may not be recoverable 
such events or circumstances include  but are not limited to  a significant decrease in the fair value of the underlying business or asset  a significant decrease in the benefits realized from the acquired business  difficulty and delays in integrating the business or a significant change in the operations of the acquired business or use of an asset 
goodwill and other intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  totaled billion as of december   which was comprised of million of goodwill  including workforce in place  and million of other intangibles assets 
other intangible assets include isp hosting relationships  customer relationships  technology in place  non compete agreements  trade names  and contracts with icann and customer lists 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to  significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of our acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business or significant negative economic trends 
if this evaluation indicates that the value of an intangible asset may be impaired  an assessment of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life is made 
if this assessment indicates that an intangible asset is not recoverable  based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows or other comparable market valuations  of the entity or technology acquired over the remaining amortization period  the net carrying value of the related intangible asset will be reduced to fair value and the remaining amortization period may be adjusted 
any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial statements 
based on these measurements  we recorded an impairment charge of approximately billion during recoverability of long lived assets other than goodwill is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 

table of contents we review  at least annually  goodwill resulting from purchase business combinations for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
we review long lived assets  including certain identifiable intangibles  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we will not be able to recover the asset s carrying amount in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
results of operations we have experienced substantial net losses in the past due primarily to the charges we have incurred for the amortization and write down of acquired goodwill and other intangible assets related to our acquisitions 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately billion  primarily due to the amortization and write down of goodwill and other intangible assets of approximately billion related to our acquisitions 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill is no longer amortized to earnings as of january  amortization of other intangible assets is expected to be approximately million in  including the impact of all acquisitions through december   and assuming no other future acquisitions or impairment charges 
we accounted for all of our acquisitions in  and as purchase business combinations 
accordingly  the acquired companies revenues  costs and expenses have been included in our results of operations beginning with their dates of acquisition

revenues beginning in the first quarter of  verisign realigned its business segments 
the new service based business segments consist of the internet services group  the telecommunication services group and network solutions 
the management s discussion and analysis that follows is based on our previous structure that was in effect throughout  and for more information on both our previous structure and our new service based business segments  please refer to note of our notes to consolidated financial statements

change change dollars in thousands managed security and network services registry and telecommunications services subtotal enterprise and service provider division web presence and trust services subtotal mass markets division total revenues total revenues increased in compared to  consisting of an increase in enterprise and service provider division revenues of partially offset by a decrease in mass markets division revenues of 
the increase in revenues for our enterprise and service provider division was primarily due to our telecommunications services acquisitions of illuminet holdings in december  and ho systems in february additionally  we experienced a modest increase in our registry services revenues 
revenues for our mass markets division  which included revenues from our web presence and trust services businesses  decreased primarily due to a decline in the amount of deferred revenue recognized in from prior year 
table of contents sales compared with the amount of such deferred revenue from prior year sales recognized in revenue 
a decrease in the number of new names and the non renewal of names paid for  contributed to this decline in deferred revenue in as compared to there were fewer domain names under management by network solutions at december   as compared to december   mainly due to the deletion of names that had never been paid for  or the term of which had expired in years prior to  but which had not been deleted in those prior years 
many of these were non revenue generating names 
revenues increased significantly in from for our enterprise and service provider division and our mass markets division 
the increases were primarily due to the acquisition of network solutions in june whose registry services revenues and web presence revenues are attributable to our enterprise and service provider division and our mass markets division  respectively 
sales of authentication services  particularly web site digital certificates and enterprise and affiliate pki services  also increased in as compared to in addition  we expanded the verisign trust network of worldwide affiliates in and saw increased demand for our training and consulting services during as compared to we derived in  in and in of our total revenues from customers with whom we have participated in a private equity round of financing  including several of the verisign affiliates as well as various technology companies in a variety of related market areas 
typically in these relationships  we sell our products and services to a company and  under a separate agreement  participate with other investors in a private equity round financing of the company 
we typically make our investments with others where our investment is less than of the total financing round 
our policy is not to recognize revenue in excess of other investors financing of the company 
these arrangements are independent relationships and are not terminable unless the terms of the agreements are violated 
in and  we derived and of our total revenues from reciprocal arrangements  respectively 
we derived no revenues from customers from reciprocal arrangements in typically in these relationships  under separate agreements  we sell our products and services to a company and that company sells to us their products and services 
we enter into these arrangements for strategic business purposes and the goods and services we receive in exchange are those we would have purchased in non reciprocal arrangements 
these arrangements are independent relationships and are not terminable unless the terms of the agreements are violated 
enterprise and service provider division enterprise and service provider division revenues from external customers were million in  million in and million in in  revenues from our managed security and network services product line decreased approximately million  to million from million in the decrease in revenues was related to a decrease in international affiliate revenues partially offset by an increase in revenues related to prior year acquisitions and from an increase in consulting services revenues which included the resale of third party products 
we expect revenues from our managed security and networks services  which will be included in our internet services group in future periods  to decrease in due to our recent decision to significantly reduce the resale of third party products 
third party software and hardware sales are generally made at lower margins than our other enterprise and mass market sales 
in  revenues from the managed security and network services product line increased approximately million  to million from million in the revenue increase was primarily due to increases in managed pki services sold  software licenses sold to new affiliate service providers  an increase in royalties earned from existing affiliates and an overall increase in the volume of consulting services that included the resale of third party products 

table of contents in  revenues from registry and telecommunications services increased approximately million  to million from million in this increase reflects the inclusion of a full year of telecommunications services revenues in relating to our acquisition of illuminet holdings in december  and over ten months of revenues relating to our acquisition of ho systems in february the acquisition of illuminet holdings and ho systems resulted in a net increase in telecommunications services revenues of approximately million in in addition  revenues from our registry services increased modestly

our registry services business unit also processed the renewal  extension or transfer of million domain names during  bringing the total number of paid domain name transactions during to million 
mass markets division mass markets division revenues were million in  million in  and million in in  the decrease in revenues of million was primarily due to the decrease in the amount of deferred revenue recognized in from prior year sales compared to the amount of such deferred revenue from prior year sales recognized in revenue 
a decrease in the number of new names and the non renewal of names paid for  contributed to this decline in deferred revenue 
this decline in revenue was also partially offset by an increase in revenues from the sales of web site digital certificates and revenues related to payment services 
at december   network solutions had a total of approximately million domain names under management compared to approximately million domain names at december  in  the increase in revenues in the mass markets division was primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of revenues from web presence services compared to approximately seven months in as a result of the acquisition of network solutions in june in  the demand for new domain name registrations in our web presence business increased substantially  as a result of  but not limited to  the so called internet bubble  our promotional programs which included free names  and from registrations by entities who registered domain names with the hopes of reselling them 
most of the unpaid for  promotional and speculative names were not renewed and have been deleted from the registry zone file in many of these were not revenue generating names or products in our mass markets division and our enterprise and service provider division issued approximately  new and renewed web site digital certificates in compared to  in and  in the total installed base of web site digital certificates was over  at december   compared to  at december  in addition  due to increased competition in the web trust services market  we have experienced moderate pricing pressure for our services 
we expect that this pricing pressure will continue in 
table of contents international revenues revenues from international subsidiaries and verisign affiliates accounted for of total revenues in  in and in the percentage decrease in revenues from international subsidiaries and verisign affiliates in compared to was primarily due to the acquisitions of illuminet holdings in december and ho systems in february whose revenues are derived principally from customers located in the united states 
additionally  a decline in the number of new licensing agreements and royalty payments received from verisign affiliates has resulted in a decrease in international revenues in of approximately million partially offset by increases in revenues from international subsidiaries of approximately million 
in  verisign is transitioning its international strategy in some countries by moving from a distribution model through the verisign affiliates to a direct distribution model through its international subsidiaries 
as a result  in we expect international revenues to increase modestly even though revenues from verisign affiliates will likely decline 
the percentage decrease in revenues from international subsidiaries and verisign affiliates in compared to was primarily related to the acquisition in june of network solutions  whose revenues are primarily attributable to us sources 
this was partially offset by additional revenues from international subsidiaries and verisign affiliates in related to an increase in the number of verisign affiliates in the verisign trust network combined with other activities to expand our presence in foreign markets 
under our international affiliate program we sign agreements with local telecommunications companies  financial institutions and others to promote  sell and distribute our pki services in international markets around the world 
these verisign affiliates typically require significant capital development  the cost of which is borne by the affiliate 
our strategy from time to time also includes investing in certain affiliates in strategic markets that represent advantageous economic opportunities for a minority investment of less than 
as a result  we invested in several international affiliates in and prior years 
revenues from verisign affiliates in which we have a minority investment of less than accounted for of total revenues in  in and in costs and expenses cost of revenues cost of revenues consists primarily of costs related to providing digital certificate enrollment and issuance services  payment services  operational costs for the domain name registration business  customer support and training  consulting and development services  carrier costs for our ss and ip based networks and costs of facilities and computer equipment used in these activities

registry fees  third party fees  other direct costs  and labor are our largest expense categories for cost of revenues 
the acquisition of illuminet holdings resulted in an increase in labor expenses of million in and an increase of million for third party fees and other direct costs 
additionally  depreciation expenses in cost of revenues increased due to the illuminet acquisition by million in compared to while overall our cost of revenues 
table of contents increased  we reduced outside consulting costs by million in from due to a company wide cost reduction effort 
our acquisition of network solutions in june of increased our cost of revenues in as compared to due to the inclusion of a full year of operating activity in compared to less than seven months in future acquisitions  further expansion into international markets and introduction of new products may result in additional increases in cost of revenues  due to the hiring of additional personnel and related expenses and other factors 
cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues increased significantly during compared to due to the inclusion of a full year of activity from our illuminet holdings acquisition and due to over months of activity from our ho systems acquisition 
our telecommunications services businesses have different cost structures than our other businesses resulting in an increase in cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues since their acquisitions 
cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues increased slightly in from  primarily due to the cost structure of the network solutions product mix and the increase in the volume of third party hardware and software sales  which was partially offset by economies of scale associated with the growth in recurring revenues from existing customers 
certain of our services  such as consulting and training  require greater initial personnel involvement and therefore have higher costs than other types of services 
in addition  revenues derived from our authentication services  domain name registration services  registry services  payment services  and our telecommunications services each have different cost structures and our overall cost of revenues may fluctuate as these businesses mature 
we anticipate that our overall cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues will decrease modestly in due to our recent decision to significantly reduce the resale of third party products 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of costs related to sales and marketing  and policy activities 
these expenses include salaries  sales commissions  sales operations and other personnel related expenses  travel and related expenses  trade shows  costs of lead generation  costs of computer and communications equipment and support services  facilities costs  consulting fees and costs of marketing programs  such as internet  television  radio  print  and direct mail advertising costs

change change dollars in thousands sales and marketing percentage of revenues sales and marketing expenses decreased on an absolute dollar basis and as a percentage of revenues in from primarily due to a substantial reduction in expenditures for advertising and related promotional activities  particularly with respect to network solutions  and from a decrease in allocated lease expenses 
advertising and related promotional expenditures declined by over million due to a heightened effort to control spending in conjunction with our restructuring program announced in april in an effort to decrease the use of external vendors for sales and marketing efforts  we have increased our internal labor expenses during this increase partially offsets the savings noted above 
the decrease in allocated lease expenses is a result of our purchase of our headquarters complex in mountain view  california in october of on an absolute dollar basis  our acquisitions of illuminet holdings and ho systems in december and february  respectively  partially offset the decrease in spending for advertising and related promotional activities and allocated lease expenses during these acquisitions resulted in an additional million of sales and marketing labor expenses for as compared to additionally  we incurred increased depreciation expense during compared to due to the depreciation of our headquarters facility and other property and equipment expenditures during

web addresses as well as value added services including web site design tools and other enhanced service offerings 
the remainder of the increase in both periods was driven by lead and demand generation activities in our enterprise and affiliate pki businesses  expansion of our sales force and an increase in international sales expenses 
on a percentage of revenues basis  the acquisition of network solutions  whose sales and marketing costs were comparatively less per revenue dollar than our other existing businesses combined  was the primary reason for the decrease in from we have continued to realize a decline in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues over the three year period presented 
this is primarily due to the increase in recurring revenues from existing customers  which tend to have lower retention costs and the increase in the productivity of our direct and inside sales forces 
however  we cannot forecast that these sales and marketing expenses will continue to decline as a percentage of revenues and we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase modestly on an absolute dollar basis in the future due to our expectations to increase our direct sales force abroad  and to expand our other distribution channels

the absolute dollar decrease is related to a substantial decrease in allocated lease expenses resulting from our purchase of our headquarters complex in mountain view  california in october  and from benefits realized as a result of our restructuring program 
additionally  during  we incurred overall higher expenses for the design  testing and deployment of our security service offerings as compared to research and development expenses increased in absolute dollars in from primarily due to the acquisition of network solutions in june the increase relates to the development and enhancement of new registry products related to multilingual domain names and managed domain name system services 
in addition  we continued to invest in the design  testing and deployment of  and technical support for our expanded digital trust service offerings and technology 
we also expanded our engineering staff and incurred related costs required to support our continued emphasis on developing new products and services as well as enhancing existing products and services 
the decrease in research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues in from is largely due to the fact that revenues increased faster than research and development expenses in these periods 
we believe that timely development of new and enhanced enterprise services  payment services  web presence services and other technologies are necessary to maintain our position in the marketplace 
accordingly  we intend to continue to recruit experienced research and development personnel and to make other investments in research and development 
as a result  we expect research and development expenses to increase modestly in absolute dollars and on a percentage of revenues basis in the future 
to date  we have expensed all research and development expenditures as incurred

if market sublease rates continue to decrease in these markets or if it takes longer than expected to sublease these facilities  the actual loss could exceed this estimate by an additional million

it is through this system that registrars from all over the world are able to register domain names with the central database 
given the high demand on the srs  it was in need of improvements and upgrades in the area of scalability  security  non english language capability and next generation resource provisioning protocol 
as of the acquisition date  network solutions was in the process of developing technology that would add substantial functionality and features to the srs 
the ipr d had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative uses 
the technological feasibility of the in process development efforts is established when the enterprise has completed all planning  designing  coding  and testing activities that are necessary to establish that the technology can be utilized to meet its design specifications including functions  features  and technical performance requirements

during  we completed our acquisition of illuminet holdings along with a number of other less significant acquisitions  which resulted in the recording of goodwill of approximately billion and other intangible assets of approximately million 
during  we completed several acquisitions including thawte  signio and network solutions 
these acquisitions resulted in the recording of goodwill and other intangible assets in the amount of billion 
we adopted sfas no

verisign also adopted sfas no 
as of january  under the provisions of sfas no 
 long lived assets  including intangible assets with finite lives  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that there has been a decline in the fair value of an asset 
the results of this testing indicated the carrying values of goodwill for certain reporting units exceeded their implied fair values and other intangible assets with finite lives had carrying values that exceeded their fair values which resulted in an impairment charge of billion in verisign determines the fair value of its reporting units  in part by engaging independent appraisers  who employ the income approach and the market comparables method of valuation 
determining the fair value of reporting units and intangible assets requires significant judgment with respect to projecting future cash flows  selecting appropriate terminal values and discount rates 
additionally  judgment is required in selecting appropriate market comparable companies in the valuations 
the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets in resulted in a write off of the net book value as follows enterprise and service provider division mass markets division total in thousands goodwill customer relationships technology in place trade name contracts with icann and customer lists prior to our adoption of sfas no 
on january   our policy was to assess the recoverability of goodwill using estimated undiscounted cash flows 
those cash flows included an estimated terminal value based 
table of contents on a hypothetical sale of an acquisition at the end of its goodwill amortization period 
although the acquisitions of thawte  signio and network solutions had been predominantly performing at or above expectations throughout  market conditions and attendant multiples used to estimate terminal values were depressed 
at june   the nasdaq market index was at  points and had decreased  points  or  to  points at june  this decline affected the analysis used to assess the recoverability of goodwill 
for goodwill associated with thawte and network solutions  fair value was determined based on future operating cash flows over the remaining amortization period of the goodwill 
the terminal values were estimated based on the relationship of the value of our stock issued at the acquisition date to the value of our stock over the three month period preceding the valuation 
for signio and the other acquisitions  fair value was determined through the use of recent indicators of fair value such as comparable sales and multiples derived from recent acquisition activities 
as a result  we recorded an impairment charge in the amount of billion in since the most significant acquisitions were completed by issuing shares of our common stock  the impairment is considered a non cash charge 
the amortization and write down of goodwill and other intangible assets was approximately billion in  billion in and billion in excluding impairment write downs of goodwill and other intangible assets  amortization expense was approximately million in  billion in and billion in the decrease in amortization expense excluding write downs in from is due to the effects of the provisions of sfas no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we have invested in may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the principal amount of our investment will probably decline in value 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by percent from levels at december   this would not materially change the fair market value of our portfolio 
to minimize this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  medium term notes  corporate bonds and notes  market auction securities  us government and agency securities and money market funds 
in general  money market funds are not subject to interest rate risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
in addition  we generally invest in relatively short term securities 
as of december   of our non strategic investments mature in less than one year 
we do not hold any derivative financial instruments 
the following table presents the amounts of our cash equivalents and investments that are subject to market risk by range of expected maturity and weighted average interest rates as of december  this table does not include money market funds because those funds are not subject to market risk 
maturing in six months or less six months to one year more than one year total estimated fair value dollars in thousands included in cash and cash equivalents weighted average interest rate included in short term investments weighted average interest rate exchange rate sensitivity we consider our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal 
all revenues derived from operations  other than verisign japan kk  thawte south africa  verisign australia limited  domainnames 
com uk and our european digital brand management services business  are denominated in united states dollars and  therefore  are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations 
revenues from international subsidiaries and affiliates accounted for approximately of our revenues in  in and in both the revenues and expenses of our majority owned subsidiaries in japan and australia as well as our wholly owned subsidiaries and sales offices in south africa  europe  and the united kingdom are denominated in local currencies 
in these regions  we believe this serves as a natural hedge against exchange rate fluctuations because although an unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the foreign currency against the united states dollar will result in lower revenues when translated to united states dollars  operating expenses will also be lower in these circumstances 
we have not engaged in any hedging activities  although if future events or changes in circumstances indicate that hedging activities would be beneficial  we may consider such activities 

table of contents equity price risk we own shares of common stock of public companies 
we value these investments using the closing market value for the last day of each month 
these investments are subject to market price volatility 
we reflect these investments on our balance sheet at their market value  with the unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in the accumulated other comprehensive income loss component of stockholders equity 
we have also invested in equity instruments of several privately held companies  many of which can still be considered in the startup or development stages  and therefore  carry a high level of risk 
in and  we determined the decline in value of certain public and non public equity investments was other than temporary and we recognized impairment losses totaling million and million  respectively 
due to the inherent risk associated with some of our investments  and in light of current stock market conditions  we may incur future losses on the sales  write downs or write offs of our investments 
we do not currently hedge against equity price changes
