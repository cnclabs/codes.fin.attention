business description and community information we are a maryland corporation that has elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust  or reit  for federal income tax purposes 
we focus on the ownership and operation of upscale apartment communities which generally command among the highest rents in their submarkets in high barrier to entry markets of the united states 
this is because we believe that  long term  the limited new supply of upscale apartment homes and lower housing affordability in these markets will result in larger increases in cash flows relative to other markets over an entire business cycle 
however  we are in a period of a business cycle where rents are resetting to lower levels  resulting in a decline in cash flows in compared to these barriers to entry generally include a difficult and lengthy entitlement process with local jurisdictions and dense urban or suburban areas where zoned and entitled land in fill locations is in limited supply 
our markets are located in the northeast  mid atlantic  midwest  pacific northwest  and northern and southern california regions of the united states 
we are a fully integrated real estate organization with in house expertise in the following areas development and redevelopment  construction and reconstruction  leasing and management  acquisition and disposition  financing  marketing  and information technologies 
we believe apartment communities present an attractive long term investment opportunity compared to other real estate investments because a broad potential resident base should result in relatively stable demand over a real estate cycle 
we intend to pursue real estate investments in markets where constraints to new supply exist and where new household formations are expected to out pace multifamily permit activity over the course of the real estate cycle 
a number of our markets are experiencing economic contraction due to continuing job losses  particularly in the technology  telecom and financial services sectors 
we expect these conditions to continue for most of although we believe we are well positioned to continue to pursue opportunities to develop and acquire upscale apartment homes based on our in house capabilities and expertise  we expect to decrease acquisition and development activity during as compared to prior years and plan to increase disposition activity 
the level of disposition  acquisition or development volume is heavily influenced by capital market conditions  including prevailing interest rates 
given current capital market and real estate market conditions  we are evaluating the appropriate allocation of capital investment among development and redevelopment communities  the acquisition of existing communities  and stock redemptions repurchases 
in addition  we expect to increase disposition activity to realize a portion of the value created over the past business cycle as well as to provide additional liquidity 
see liquidity and capital resources and future financing and capital needs 
our real estate investments consist primarily of current operating apartment communities  communities in various stages of development  and development rights ie  land or land options held for development 
our current operating communities are further distinguished as established  other stabilized  lease up and redevelopment 
a description of these categories and operating performance information can be found in note  segment reporting  in our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
on december   we owned or had an ownership interest in these categories as follows number of number of communities apartment homes current communities established communities northeast mid atlantic midwest pacific northwest northern california southern california total established other stabilized communities northeast mid atlantic midwest pacific northwest northern california southern california total other stabilized lease up communities redevelopment communities total current communities development communities development rights results of operations and funds from operations a comparison of our operating results for the years  and follows dollars in thousands change change revenue rental income management fees other income total revenue expenses direct property operating expenses  excluding property taxes property taxes total community operating expenses net operating income property management and other indirect operating expenses interest expense depreciation expense general and administrative expense impairment loss total other expenses equity in income of unconsolidated entities interest income minority interest in consolidated partnerships income before gain on sale of communities gain on sale of communities income from continuing operations discontinued operations operating income gain on sale of communities total discontinued operations net income dividends attributable to preferred stock net income available to common stockholders net income available to common stockholders decreased  to  in this decrease is primarily attributable to fewer gains on sales of communities in  coupled with a decline in net operating income due to deteriorating market conditions in several of our principal markets and increases in interest and depreciation expenses 
net income available to common stockholders increased by  to  in due to additional net operating income from newly developed and redeveloped communities  as well as growth in net operating income from established communities and increased gain on sale of communities 
net operating income noi is calculated at the community level and represents total revenue less direct property operating expenses  including property taxes  and excludes property management and other indirect operating expenses  interest expense  depreciation expense  general and administrative expense and impairment losses 
we believe that noi is an appropriate supplemental measure of our operating performance because it helps investors to understand the recurring operations of our real estate portfolio  as well as provide insight into how management evaluates operations on a segment basis 
noi does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
therefore  it should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance 
noi should also not be considered an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities  as determined by gaap  as a measure of liquidity 
additionally  it is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs 
a calculation of noi  along with a reconciliation to net income  is provided in the preceding table 
the noi decrease of  for the year ended december  and the increase of  for the year ended december  as compared to the prior years consist of changes in the following categories increase decrease increase decrease established communities other stabilized communities communities sold development and redevelopment communities total noi the noi decrease in established communities in was largely due to the effects of the weakened economy in many of our submarkets 
strong single family home sales  partially fueled by a low mortgage rate environment  in addition to continuing job losses in many of our submarkets  have aggravated a weak demand environment  causing market rental rates and occupancies to decline 
we currently expect to continue to experience weak demand during most of we also anticipate that any growth or improvement that we may experience in late will be at a slower rate than that experienced by the overall market and economy  if any  due to the types of industries technology  telecom  financial services that make up a large proportion of the jobs in our markets 
rental income increased due to rental income generated from acquired and newly developed communities offset by a decline in occupancies and effective rental rates for established communities 
overall portfolio the weighted average number of occupied apartment homes increased to  apartment homes for compared to  apartment homes for and  in this change in is primarily the result of increased homes available from acquired and newly developed communities  offset by occupancy declines related to the weakened demand in certain of our submarkets 
the weighted average monthly revenue per occupied apartment home decreased to  in compared to  in and  in established communities rental revenue decreased  in and increased by  in the decrease in is due to both declining effective rental rates and declining economic occupancy 
the increase in is due to market conditions during the year that allowed for higher average rents partially offset by lower economic occupancy 
for  the weighted average monthly revenue per occupied apartment home decreased to  compared to  for  partially due to increased concessions granted in the average economic occupancy decreased from in to for economic occupancy takes into account the fact that apartment homes of different sizes and locations within a community have different economic impacts on a community s gross revenue 
economic occupancy is defined as gross potential revenue less vacancy loss as a percentage of gross potential revenue 
gross potential revenue is determined by valuing occupied homes at contract rates and vacant homes at market rents 
although most of our markets have experienced weak demand  we have observed the most significant declines in average rental rates and occupancy during in certain northern california and northeast submarkets 
northern california  which accounts for approximately of current established community rental revenue  experienced a decline in rental revenue in  partially related to job losses in the technology sector 
although economic occupancy remained flat in northern california in as compared to  average rental rates dropped from  to  for those same periods 
the northeast region also accounts for approximately of current established community rental revenue and has been experiencing a decline in rental revenue  primarily the result of job losses in the financial services sector 
economic occupancy decreased in the northeast  from in to for  while average rental rates improved slightly during other income increased primarily due to the recognition of  and  in and  respectively  of business interruption insurance related to the settlement of a fire insurance claim that occurred during the construction of avalon at edgewater 
in addition  we recognized  in the first quarter of in construction management fees in connection with the redevelopment of a community owned by a limited liability company in which we have a membership interest 
direct property operating expenses  excluding property taxes increased due to the addition of newly developed  redeveloped and acquired apartment homes coupled with increased insurance  marketing and bad debt 
insurance expense has increased over the past two years  particularly during as the insurance and reinsurance markets deteriorated  resulting in higher insurance costs for the entire real estate sector 
we renewed our general liability policy on august  and our property coverage on november  see insurance and risk of uninsured losses for a discussion of our insurance policies and related coverage 
insurance and other costs associated with development and redevelopment communities are expensed as communities move from the initial construction and lease up phase to the stabilized operating phase 
marketing initiatives have been expanded in response to the weak demand  and bad debt expense has increased as a direct result of continuing job losses and the weakened economy 
for established communities  direct property operating expenses  excluding property taxes  increased  to  due to the increases in insurance  marketing and bad debt expenses discussed above 
during  operating expenses increased  due to increases in insurance  utilities  marketing and office and administration expenses 
property taxes increased due to higher assessments and the addition of newly developed and redeveloped apartment homes 
property taxes on development and redevelopment communities are capitalized while the community is under construction 
we begin to expense these costs as homes within the community receive a final certificate of occupancy 
for established communities  the increases in property taxes in and of  and  respectively  were primarily due to higher assessments throughout all regions 
property management and other indirect operating expenses decreased in and increased in as a result of executive separation costs that were recognized in but not in or the decrease in is partially offset by increases in unallocated central marketing costs and abandoned pursuit costs 
similar to the community level  central marketing initiatives have been expanded in response to the weak demand 
abandoned pursuit costs increased  from  in to  in related to development rights which may not be developed as planned 
interest expense increased in due to the issuance of  of unsecured notes between september and december  partially offset by the repayment of  of unsecured notes in september and overall lower interest rates on both short term and long term borrowings 
in addition  higher average outstanding balances on our unsecured credit facility resulted in higher interest expense between years 
interest expense increased in due to the issuance of  of unsecured notes during and depreciation expense increased primarily related to acquisitions and completion of development or redevelopment activities 
we expect depreciation expense to continue to increase as we complete additional development and redevelopment communities  partially offset by the elimination of depreciation of communities that are sold or designated as held for sale during general and administrative expense decreased in and increased in as a result of additional compensation expense recognized in the fourth quarter of due to the retirement of a senior executive 
unfilled positions and lower incentive compensation also contributed to the decrease in impairment loss of  was recorded during related to two land parcels that as of december  were determined not likely to proceed to development and therefore were planned for disposition 
this loss was recorded to reflect the parcels at fair market value based on their entitlement status as of december   less estimated selling costs 
in february  we won an appeal regarding the entitlement status of one of these parcels 
if we decide to continue with the planned disposition  this change in entitlement status may increase the potential value of the land and therefore decrease the previously estimated loss that would be recognized at the date of disposal 
however  we are currently reevaluating our plans for this parcel  which may result in in the partial recovery of the impairment loss recognized in  if we decide to hold the land for development 
equity in income of unconsolidated entities decreased during primarily due to losses recorded for an investment in a technology company accounted for under the equity method 
during and  we recorded losses of  and  respectively  related to this investment  bringing the carrying value of this investment to zero as of december  in addition  a  valuation allowance was recorded during for an investment in a different technology company which contributed to the decrease in over the prior year period 
interest income during decreased due to lower average cash balances invested and lower interest rates 
the increase in interest income during resulted from higher average cash balances invested 
gain on sale of communities  including discontinued operations  of   and  were realized in  and  respectively 
these gains on the sale of communities are the result of our strategy to sell communities that do not meet our long term strategic objectives and redeploy the proceeds to current development and redevelopment communities 
the amount of gains realized depend on many factors  including the number of communities sold  the size and carrying value of those communities  and the market conditions in the local area 
in  we expect to increase our disposition activity as compared to funds from operations we consider funds from operations ffo to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our operating performance because it helps investors understand our ability to incur and service debt and to make capital expenditures 
we believe that in order to understand our operating results  ffo should be examined with net income as presented in the consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive income included elsewhere in this report 
consistent with the definition adopted by the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts  we calculate ffo as net income or loss computed in accordance with gaap  except that excluded from net income or loss are gains or losses on sales of property including any impairment loss on planned dispositions and extraordinary gains or losses as defined by gaap  plus depreciation of real estate assets  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap 
therefore it should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance 
ffo should also not be considered an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities  as determined by gaap  as a measure of liquidity 
additionally  it is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs 
further  ffo as calculated by other reits may not be comparable to our calculation of ffo 
the following is a reconciliation of net income to ffo and a presentation of gaap based cash flow metrics dollars in thousands years ended funds from operations net income dividends attributable to preferred stock depreciation real estate assets depreciation discontinued operations joint venture adjustments minority interest expense gain on sale of communities  net of impairment loss on planned dispositions funds from operations gaap based cash flow metrics net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities capitalization of fixed assets and community improvements our policy with respect to capital expenditures is generally to capitalize only non recurring expenditures 
we capitalize improvements and upgrades only if the item exceeds  extends the useful life of the asset  and is not related to making an apartment home ready for the next resident 
under this policy  virtually all capitalized costs are non recurring  as recurring make ready costs are expensed as incurred 
recurring make ready costs include the following carpet and appliance replacements  floor coverings  interior painting  and other redecorating costs 
we capitalize purchases of personal property  such as computers and furniture  only if the item is a new addition and the item exceeds  we generally expense purchases of personal property made for replacement purposes 
for established and other stabilized communities  we recorded non revenue generating capitalized expenditures of approximately per apartment home in and per apartment home in the average maintenance costs charged to expense  including carpet and appliance replacements  related to these communities was  per apartment home in and  in we anticipate that capitalized costs per apartment home will gradually increase as the average age of our communities increases 
we expect expensed maintenance costs to increase as the average age of our communities increases  and to fluctuate with changes in turnover 
we have expanded our consolidated statements of cash flows included elsewhere in this report to include additional information on capital expenditures 
for the years ended december  and  the amounts capitalized excluding land costs related to i acquisitions  development and redevelopment were  and  respectively  ii revenue generating expenditures  such as water sub metering equipment and cable installations were  and  respectively  and iii non revenue generating expenditures were  and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity 
the primary source of liquidity is our cash flows from operations 
operating cash flows have historically been determined by the number of apartment homes  rental rates  occupancy levels  and our expenses with respect to these apartment homes 
the timing  source and amount of cash flows provided by financing activities and used in investing activities are sensitive to the capital markets environment  particularly to changes in interest rates 
changes in the capital markets environment affect our plans for undertaking construction and development as well as acquisition and disposition activity 
cash and cash equivalents totaled  at december   a decrease of  for the year 
the following discussion relates to changes in cash due to operating  investing and financing activities  which are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows included in this report 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities decreased to  in from  in primarily due to the decline in operating income from established communities and the loss of operating income from communities sold during and  partially offset by additional operating income from newly developed and redeveloped communities 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities of  in related to investments in assets through development  redevelopment and acquisition of apartment communities  partially offset by proceeds from the sales of apartment communities 
during  we invested  in the purchase and development of real estate and capital expenditures 
we began the development of seven new communities 
these communities  if developed as expected  will contain a total of  apartment homes  and the total investment  including land acquisition costs  is projected to be approximately  we also completed the development of ten new communities containing a total of  apartment homes for a total investment  including land acquisition cost  of  we completed the redevelopment of two communities containing  apartment homes for a total investment in redevelopment excluding acquisition costs of  we acquired two communities containing apartment homes for a total investment of  including the assumption of  in debt 
we had capital expenditures relating to current communities real estate assets of  and non real estate capital expenditures of the development and redevelopment of communities involve risks that the investment will fail to perform in accordance with expectations 
see risks of development and redevelopment in item of this report for our discussion of these and other risks inherent in developing or redeveloping communities 
we sold one community during  generating net proceeds of  these proceeds are being used to develop and redevelop communities currently under construction and reconstruction  as well as to repay and redeem certain debt and equity securities  as discussed below 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities totaled  for the year ended december   primarily due to the issuance of unsecured notes and an increase in borrowings under our unsecured credit facility  partially offset by dividends paid  common stock repurchases  and the redemption of the series c preferred stock 
see note  notes payable  unsecured notes and credit facility  and note  stockholders equity  in our consolidated financial statements  for additional information 
we regularly review our short and long term liquidity needs  the adequacy of funds from operations  as defined above  and other expected liquidity sources to meet these needs 
we believe our principal short term liquidity needs are to fund normal recurring operating expenses  debt service and maturity payments  the distributions required with respect to preferred stock  the minimum dividend payments required to maintain our reit qualification under the internal revenue code of  opportunities for the acquisition of improved property  and development and redevelopment activity in which we are currently engaged 
we anticipate that we can fully satisfy these needs from a combination of cash flows provided by operating activities  proceeds from asset dispositions and borrowing capacity under the unsecured credit facility 
one of our principal long term liquidity needs is the repayment of medium and long term debt at the time that such debt matures 
for unsecured notes  we anticipate that no significant portion of the principal of these notes will be repaid prior to maturity 
on january    in unsecured notes matured and was paid  including the balance of accrued interest 
during the remainder of  we have  in maturing unsecured notes 
if we do not have funds on hand sufficient to repay our indebtedness  it will be necessary for us to refinance this debt 
this refinancing may be accomplished by uncollateralized private or public debt offerings  additional debt financing that is collateralized by mortgages on individual communities or groups of communities  draws on our credit facility or by additional equity offerings 
we also anticipate having retained cash flow available in each year so that when a debt obligation matures  some or all of each maturity can be satisfied from this retained cash 
although we believe we will have the capacity to meet our long term liquidity needs  we cannot assure you that additional debt financing or debt or equity offerings will be available or  if available  that they will be on terms we consider satisfactory 
capital resources 
we intend to match the long term nature of our real estate assets with long term cost effective capital to the extent permitted by prevailing market conditions 
from january  through february   we issued  of unsecured notes through public offerings 
we expect this source of capital  together with cash flow from operating activities  dispositions  and other sources of capital  to remain available to meet our capital needs  for the foreseeable future  although no assurance can be provided that the debt capital markets will remain available or that such debt will be available on attractive terms 
variable rate unsecured credit facility our unsecured revolving credit facility is furnished by a syndicate of banks and provides up to  in short term credit 
under the terms of the credit facility  if we elect to increase the facility up to  and one or more banks from the syndicate or otherwise voluntarily agree to provide the additional commitment  then we will be able to increase the facility up to  and no member of the syndicate of banks can prohibit such increase  such an increase in the facility will only be effective to the extent banks from the syndicate or otherwise choose to commit to lend additional funds 
we pay participating banks  in the aggregate  an annual facility fee of  in equal quarterly installments 
the unsecured credit facility bears interest at varying levels based on the london interbank offered rate libor  rating levels achieved on our unsecured notes and on a maturity schedule selected by us 
the current stated pricing is libor plus per annum on february  
pricing could vary if there is a change in rating by either of the two leading national rating agencies  a change in rating of one level would impact the unsecured credit facility pricing by to 
a competitive bid option is available for borrowings of up to  this option allows banks that are part of the lender consortium to bid to provide us loans at a rate that is lower than the stated pricing provided by the unsecured credit facility 
the competitive bid option may result in lower pricing if market conditions allow 
pricing under the competitive bid option resulted in average pricing of libor plus for amounts most recently borrowed under the competitive bid option 
the existing facility matures in may assuming exercise of a one year renewal at our option 
at february    was outstanding   was used to provide letters of credit and  was available for borrowing under the unsecured credit facility 
interest rate protection agreements we are not a party to any long term interest rate agreements  other than interest rate protection and swap agreements on approximately  of our variable rate tax exempt indebtedness 
we intend  however  to evaluate the need for long term interest rate protection agreements as interest rate market conditions dictate  and we have engaged a consultant to assist in managing our interest rate risks and exposure 
future financing and capital needs as of december   we had new communities under construction  for which a total estimated cost of  remained to be invested 
in addition  we had two communities under reconstruction  for which a total estimated cost of  remained to be invested 
substantially all of the capital expenditures necessary to complete the communities currently under construction and reconstruction will be funded from the remaining capacity under our current  unsecured credit facility  the net proceeds from sales of existing communities  retained operating cash  and or the issuance of debt or equity securities 
we expect to continue to fund development costs related to pursuing development rights from retained operating cash and borrowings under the unsecured credit facility 
we believe these sources of capital will be adequate to take the proposed communities to the point in the development cycle where construction can begin 
before planned reconstruction activity or the construction of a development right begins  we intend to arrange adequate financing to complete these undertakings  although we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing 
in the event that financing cannot be obtained  we may have to abandon development rights  write off associated pursuit costs that were capitalized and or forego reconstruction activity 
in such instances  we will not realize the increased revenues and earnings that we expected from such pursuits 
our liquidity could be adversely impacted by expanding development and acquisition activities and or reduced capital as compared to prior years available from asset sales 
to meet the balance of our liquidity needs under such conditions  we would need to arrange additional capacity under our existing unsecured credit facility  sell additional existing communities and or issue additional debt or equity securities 
while we believe we have the financial position to expand our short term credit capacity and support our capital markets activity  we cannot assure you that we will be successful in completing these arrangements  sales or offerings 
the failure to complete these transactions on a cost effective basis could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition  including the abandonment of development pursuits 
it is our policy to sell assets that do not meet our long term investment criteria when market conditions are favorable  and to redeploy the proceeds 
when we decide to sell a community  we generally solicit competing bids from unrelated parties for these individual assets and consider the sales price and tax ramifications of each proposal 
we intend to actively seek buyers for communities that we determine to hold for sale 
we expect to accelerate our disposition program during in response to current and anticipated real estate and capital markets conditions 
however  we cannot assure you that assets can be sold on terms that we consider satisfactory or that market conditions will continue to make the sale of assets an appealing strategy 
because the proceeds from the sale of communities may not be immediately redeployed into revenue generating assets  the immediate effect of a sale of a community is to reduce total revenues  total expenses and funds from operations 
therefore  an acceleration of our disposition program in may adversely impact total revenues and funds from operations 
as of february   we have six communities classified as held for sale under gaap 
we are actively pursuing the disposition of these communities and expect to close during the first and second quarters of however  we cannot assure you that these communities will be sold as planned 
we have minority interest investments in three technology companies  including constellation real technologies llc  constellation  an entity formed by a number of real estate investment trusts and real estate operating companies for the purpose of investing in multi sector real estate technology opportunities 
our original commitment to constellation was  but  as a result of an agreement among the members reducing the commitment due from each member  our commitment is currently  of which we have contributed  to date 
the remaining unfunded commitment of  is expected to be funded over the next five years 
in january  we invested an additional  in realeum  inc  realeum  a company involved in the development and deployment of a property management and leasing automation system 
pursuant to an agreement with realeum  we utilize the property management and leasing automation system in exchange for payments under a licensing arrangement 
realeum is negotiating licensing arrangements with other real estate companies that we are unaffiliated with 
if unsuccessful in negotiating additional licensing agreements  realeum may be required to obtain additional sources of funding 
our third technology investment is in rent 
com  an internet based rental housing information provider 
we have no obligation to contribute additional funds to these technology investments  other than the commitment to constellation as previously described

stock repurchase program in july we announced that our board of directors had authorized a common stock repurchase program 
under this program  we may acquire shares of our common stock in open market or negotiated transactions up to an aggregate purchase price of  actual purchases of stock will vary with market conditions 
the size of the stock repurchase program was designed so that retained cash flow  as well as the proceeds from sales of existing apartment communities and a reduction in planned acquisitions  will provide the source of funding for the program  with our unsecured credit facility providing temporary funding as needed 
through february   we have acquired  shares at an aggregate cost of  under this program 
redemption of preferred stock in july  we redeemed all  outstanding shares of our series c cumulative redeemable preferred stock at a price of per share  plus in accrued and unpaid dividends  for an aggregate redemption price of  including accrued dividends of  the redemption price was funded in part by the sale on july  of  shares of series i cumulative redeemable preferred stock through a private placement to an institutional investor for a net purchase price of  the dividend rate on such shares was initially equal to per annum three month libor plus of the liquidation preference 
as permitted under the terms of such preferred stock  we redeemed all of the series i cumulative redeemable preferred stock on august  for an aggregate redemption price of  including accrued dividends of as of february   we have the following series of redeemable preferred stock outstanding at an aggregate stated value of  these series have no stated maturity and are not subject to any sinking fund or mandatory redemptions 
as these series become redeemable  we will evaluate the requirements necessary for such redemptions as well as the cost effectiveness based on the existing market conditions 
shares outstanding payable annual liquidation non redeemable series february  quarterly rate preference prior to d  march  june  september  december december  currently redeemable h  march  june  september  december october  on february   we gave notice of our intent to redeem all  outstanding shares of our series d cumulative redeemable preferred stock 
we anticipate closing this redemption on march  at a price of per share  plus in accrued and unpaid dividends  for an aggregate redemption price of  including accrued dividends of  this redemption will be funded by the sale of shares of series j cumulative redeemable preferred stock through a private placement to an institutional investor 
the dividend rate on such shares will initially be based on three month libor plus 
the series j cumulative redeemable preferred stock will be redeemable at any time at our option 
inflation and deflation substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of one year or less 
in the event of significant inflation  this may enable us to realize increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or the beginning of new leases 
short term leases generally minimize our risk from the adverse effects of inflation  although these leases generally permit residents to leave at the end of the lease term without penalty and therefore expose us to the effect of a decline in market rents 
in a deflationary rent environment  as is currently being experienced  we are exposed to declining rents more quickly under these shorter term leases 
critical accounting policies our accounting policies are in conformity with gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies  including making estimates and assumptions 
these judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different  it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements 
below is a discussion of accounting policies which we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters which are inherently uncertain 
additional discussion of accounting policies which we consider significant  including further discussion of the critical accounting policies described below  can be found in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
real estate development rights we capitalize pre development costs incurred in pursuit of new development opportunities for which we currently believe future development is probable 
these costs include legal fees  design fees and related overhead costs 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements include a charge to expense to provide an allowance for potentially unrecoverable capitalized pre development costs 
the determination of the charge to expense involves management judgement regarding the probability that a pursuit will not proceed to development 
revenue recognition rental income related to leases is recognized on an accrual basis when due from residents in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
in accordance with our standard lease terms  rental payments are generally due on a monthly basis 
any cash concessions given at the inception of the lease are amortized over the approximate life of the lease generally one year 
real estate if there is an event or change in circumstance that indicates an impairment in the value of a community  our policy is to assess the impairment by making a comparison of the current and projected operating cash flows of the community over its remaining useful life  on an undiscounted basis  to the carrying amount of the community 
if the carrying amount is in excess of the estimated projected operating cash flows of the community  we would recognize an impairment loss equivalent to an amount required to adjust the carrying amount to its estimated fair market value 
discontinued operations on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which requires that the assets and liabilities and the results of operations of any communities which have been sold during  or otherwise qualify as held for sale as of december   be presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements in both current and prior periods presented 
the community specific components of net income that are presented as discontinued operations include net operating income  depreciation and interest expense 
in addition  the net gain or loss including any impairment loss on the eventual disposal of communities held for sale is presented as discontinued operations when recognized 
real estate assets held for sale are measured at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less the cost to sell  and are presented separately in our consolidated balance sheets 
subsequent to classification of a community as held for sale  no further depreciation is recorded on the assets 
investments in technology companies we account for our investments in technology companies in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock 
if there is an event or change in circumstance that indicates a loss in the value of an investment  our policy is to record the loss and reduce the value of the investment to its fair value 
a loss in value would be indicated if we could not recover the carrying value of the investment or if the investee could not sustain an earnings capacity that would justify the carrying amount of the investment 
due to the nature of these investments  an impairment in value can be difficult to determine 
stock based compensation during the periods presented in this report  we applied apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  in accounting for our employee stock options 
no stock based employee compensation cost is reflected in net income  as all options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
see note  stock based compensation plans  in our consolidated financial statements for information regarding the effect on net income and earnings per share if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to stock based employee compensation 
legal contingencies we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business 
these matters are frequently covered by insurance 
while the resolution of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty  we believe the final outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or the results of operations 
once it has been determined that a loss is probable to occur  the estimated amount of the loss is recorded in the financial statements 
both the amount of the loss and the point at which its occurrence is considered probable can be difficult to determine 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain financial market risks  the most predominant being fluctuations in interest rates 
we monitor interest rate fluctuations as an integral part of our overall risk management program  which recognizes the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effect on our results of operations 
the effect of interest rate fluctuations historically has been small relative to other factors affecting operating results  such as rental rates and occupancy 
the specific market risks and the potential impact on our operating results are described below 
our operating results are affected by changes in interest rates as a result of borrowings under our variable rate unsecured credit facility as well as outstanding bonds with variable interest rates 
we had  and  in variable rate debt outstanding as of december  and  respectively 
if interest rates on the variable rate debt had been basis points higher throughout and  our annual interest costs would have increased by approximately  and  respectively  based on balances outstanding during the applicable years 
we currently use interest rate swap agreements to reduce the impact of interest rate fluctuations on certain variable rate indebtedness 
under swap agreements  we agree to pay to a counterparty the interest that would have been incurred on a fixed principal amount at a fixed interest rate generally  the interest rate on a particular treasury bond on the date the agreement is entered into  plus a fixed increment  and the counterparty agrees to pay to us the interest that would have been incurred on the same principal amount at an assumed floating interest rate tied to a particular market index 
as of december   the effect of swap agreements is to fix the interest rate on approximately  of our variable rate tax exempt debt 
furthermore  a swap agreement to fix the interest rate on approximately  of unconsolidated variable rate debt exists as of december  the swap agreements on the consolidated variable rate tax exempt debt were not electively entered into by us but  rather  were a requirement of either the bond issuer or the credit enhancement provider related to certain of our tax exempt bond financings 
because the counterparties providing the swap agreements are major financial institutions which have an a or better credit rating by the standard poor s ratings group and the interest rates fixed by the swap agreements are significantly higher than current market rates for such agreements  we do not believe there is exposure at this time to a default by a counterparty provider
