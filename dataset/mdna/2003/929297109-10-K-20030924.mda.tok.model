item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
participation games in fiscal  we introduced the first of our participation games  a series of four monopoly themed games under an exclusive license from hasbro  inc in april  we introduced free parking  the eleventh game in the monopoly series  and we intend to introduce two new monopoly branded participation games per year to keep the brand fresh and entertaining 
our game designers use secondary bonus rounds in combination with the actual elements of the monopoly board game to create the highly entertaining games 
these elements include mr 
monopoly  chance  community chest and the distinctive game board and tokens  some set to a background of big band music 
most of our participation games are multi coin  multi line video games  although some of the earlier games are mechanical reel spinning gaming machines 
in fiscal  we introduced puzzle pays  a second series of participation games  based on popular licensed puzzle game themes 
the first game in the puzzle pays series was jumble  based on the popular scrambled word game appearing in newspapers nationwide 
two additional puzzle pays gaming machines followed bee bucks  the sequel to jumble  and a scrabble themed game 
in fiscal  we had limited introductions of two additional puzzle pays gaming machines  pictionary and scrabble winning recipe 
in fiscal  we launched three new participation game series hollywood squares  in the winter of  pac man  based on the popular classic arcade game  in the spring of  and survivor  based on the popular television show in the spring of the survivor game was commercialized in association with international game technology  or igt  which places these games on its megajackpots wide area progressive system

table of contents after substantially increasing our game development staff over the last months  we expect to launch ten new participation games in fiscal  including a new branded series  men in black  subject to regulatory approval 
our installed base of participation games decreased from  units at june  to  units at june  net win per day per gaming device decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal  which we believe resulted from a delay in new game approvals pending completion of upgrades to our existing operating system software 
we believe the decline in units was due to our inability to refresh the installed base in the first half of the year as regulators awaited stabilization of our existing operating system  our removal of participation games in low performing casinos  and the removal of our participation games by casinos due to i our current platform not supporting features and functionality required by the customers or ii our game performance not meeting operators expectations 
the average installed base decreased from  units in fiscal to  units in fiscal see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

our vlts typically are located in places where casino type gaming is not the principal attraction  such as racetracks  bars and restaurants 
parts sales  game conversions  oem and used games 
we sell replacement parts and game theme conversions of our gaming machines

table of contents competition the gaming machine market is intensely competitive and is characterized by the continuous introduction of new game titles and new technologies 
our ability to compete successfully in this market is based  in large part  upon our ability to create an expanding and constantly refreshed portfolio of games with high earnings performance  offer machines that consistently out perform other gaming machines  identify and obtain rights to commercially marketable intellectual properties  and adapt our products for use with new technologies 
in addition  successful competition in this market is also based upon engineering innovation and reliability  mechanical reliability  brand recognition  marketing and customer support  and price or lease terms 
we estimate that about companies in the world manufacture gaming machines and vlts for legalized gaming markets 
of these companies  we believe that a majority of this worldwide market is controlled by igt  bally gaming  aristocrat technologies  atronic casino technology and wms 
our competitors vary in size from small companies with limited resources to a few large corporations with greater financial  marketing and product development resources than ours 
the larger competitors have an advantage in being able to spend greater amounts than us to develop new technologies and features that are attractive to players and customers 
in addition  some of our competitors have developed  sell or otherwise provide to customers security  centralized player tracking and accounting systems which allow casino operators to accumulate slot accounting and performance data about the operation of gaming devices 
we do not currently offer these systems 
in the video and mechanical reel spinning gaming machine market  we compete with market leader igt  as well as bally gaming  sigma game  atronic casino technology  mikohn gaming  shuffle master  konami  franco  unidesa and aristocrat technologies 
in the vlt market  we compete primarily with igt  g tech holdings  scientific games and spielo gaming international 
manufacturing we have manufactured all of our gaming devices in our facility in waukegan  illinois  since fiscal this modern facility has allowed us to achieve increased operating efficiencies over our previous facility 
we have reduced our product lead times to weeks  which we believe to be lower than the industry average 
in addition  we have added additional assembly lines to increase our practical assembly capacity  which we believe will further lower our product lead times in fiscal manufacturing commitments are generally based on purchase orders from customers 
our manufacturing process generally consists of assembling component parts into a completed gaming machine and  generally  is initiated only on the basis of sales orders with our customers 
in some cases  however  component parts are purchased and assembled into finished goods  which are inventoried in order to be able to quickly fill customer orders 
we generally warrant our gaming machines sold in the us for a period of days 
the raw materials used in manufacturing our gaming machines include various metals  plastics  wood  glass and numerous component parts  including electronic subassemblies  video monitors and lcd screens 
we believe that our sources of supply of component parts and raw materials are adequate and that alternative sources of materials are available

where importation is permitted  some countries prohibit or restrict the payout feature of the traditional slot machine or limit the operation of slot machines to a controlled number of casinos or casino like locations 
each gaming machine must comply with the individual jurisdiction s regulations 
certain jurisdictions require the licensing of gaming machine operators and manufacturers 
we manufacture and supply gaming equipment to various foreign markets including asia  australia  canada  europe and south africa 
we have the required licenses to manufacture and distribute our products in the foreign jurisdictions in which we do business 
seasonality sales of our gaming machines to casinos are generally strongest in the spring and slowest in the summer months 
in addition  quarterly revenues and net income may increase when we receive a larger number of approvals for new games from regulators than in other quarters  when a game that achieves significant player appeal is introduced or if gaming is permitted in a significant new jurisdiction 
employees at september   we employed approximately persons domestically and internationally 
approximately of our employees were represented by the international brotherhood of electrical workers the ibew at that date 
we have a collective bargaining agreement with the ibew related to our waukegan  illinois manufacturing facility  which expires on june  we believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory 
risk factors the most significant factors that make an investment in our common stock risky or speculative are discussed below 
these factors may cause our operating results to vary from anticipated results or may adversely affect our operating results or the value of our common stock 
software anomalies and fraudulent manipulation of our gaming machines and software could reduce our revenue  increase our costs  burden our engineering and marketing resources  involve us in litigation and adversely affect our gaming licenses 
our success depends on our ability to avoid  detect  replicate and correct software and hardware anomalies and fraudulent manipulation of our gaming machines and associated software 
our gaming machines and software have experienced anomalies and fraudulent manipulation in the past 
gaming machines which are susceptible to anomalies and manipulation may be replaced by the casinos if they do not perform according to expectations or may be shut down by regulators 
in the event of such issues with our gaming machines and software  substantial engineering and marketing resources may be diverted from other projects to correct these issues  which may delay our other projects 
in addition  regulators may not approve new games  which may substantially reduce our revenues 
our games are generally subject to rigorous testing  both internally and by various gaming jurisdictions 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to build and 
table of contents maintain software based gaming devices that are free from anomalies or manipulations and satisfy these tests 
our gaming machines have in the past and could in the future be susceptible to software anomalies and manipulation after the gaming software has been widely distributed 
in addition  the occurrence of anomalies in  or fraudulent manipulation of  our gaming machines and software may give rise to claims for lost revenues and related litigation by our customers  and may subject us to investigation or other action by gaming regulatory authorities including suspension or revocation of our gaming licenses 
we cannot assure you that  in the event that anomalies or manipulations occur in our gaming machines and software  any gaming authorities will not subject us to disciplinary action 
see also regulators may not approve our new gaming platforms  cabinet designs and related hardware and our revenues may be limited and our gaming machine business is heavily regulated  and we must obtain and maintain our gaming licenses and regulatory approvals to continue to operate our business and sell our products 
regulators may not approve our new gaming platforms  cabinet designs and related hardware  and our revenues may be limited 
in september we began to introduce new gaming platforms  consisting of a computer circuit board and operating system software  for both video and mechanical reel spinning games  and new cabinet designs 
if regulators do not approve the new gaming platforms  cabinet designs and related hardware  we will not be able to sell these products  which would significantly limit our future growth and profitability  and we may not recover our development costs 
when we introduce these products  we cannot be assured that they will be free of hardware or software problems that may reduce our revenues  increase our costs  or adversely affect our relationships with customers and regulators 
our gaming machine business is heavily regulated  and we must obtain and maintain our gaming licenses and regulatory approvals to continue to operate our business and sell our products 
the manufacture and distribution of gaming machines is subject to extensive federal  state  local and foreign regulations and taxes  and the governments of the various gaming jurisdictions amend these regulations from time to time 
virtually all of these jurisdictions require licenses  permits  documentation of qualification  including evidence of financial stability  and other forms of approval for manufacturers and distributors of gaming machines and for their officers  directors  major securityholders and key personnel 
the gaming authorities in some jurisdictions may investigate any individual who has a material relationship with us and any securityholder to determine whether the individual or securityholder is acceptable to those gaming authorities 
any securityholder investigated by the gaming authorities must pay the costs of the investigation 
each of our games and gaming machine hardware and software must be approved in each jurisdiction in which it is placed  and we cannot assure you that a particular game or hardware or software will be approved in any jurisdiction 
licenses  approvals or findings of suitability may be revoked  suspended or conditioned 
the revocation or denial of a license in a particular jurisdiction means that we cannot sell our products in that jurisdiction  and could adversely affect our ability to obtain or maintain licenses in other jurisdictions 
if we fail to seek or do not receive a necessary registration  license  approval or finding of suitability  we may be prohibited from selling our gaming machines for use in the jurisdiction 
some jurisdictions require gaming manufacturers to obtain government approval before engaging in some transactions  such as business combinations 
obtaining licenses and approvals can be time consuming and costly 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain all necessary registrations  licenses  permits  approvals or findings of suitability in a timely manner  or at all 
similarly  we cannot assure you that our current registrations  licenses  approvals or findings of suitability will not be revoked  suspended or conditioned 
our profitability depends heavily on recurring revenue from gaming operations  the loss of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability 
approximately million  or  of our revenues for fiscal  and million  or  of our revenues in fiscal  were derived from gaming operations 
in addition  for fiscal  our gross margin on 
table of contents gaming operations was while our gross margin on product sales was 
for fiscal  our gross margin on gaming operations was  while our gross margin on product sales was 
therefore  our level of revenue from gaming operations has a significant effect on our profitability 
participation games are replaced by casino operators if the gaming machines do not meet and sustain revenue and net win expectations 
therefore  these gaming machines are particularly susceptible to pressure from competitors  declining popularity and changes in economic conditions and are at risk of replacement by the casinos  ending the recurring revenues from these machines 
we cannot assure you that our participation games will continue to meet the casinos revenue requirements 
if we do not continue to introduce new games and gaming machines that achieve and maintain market acceptance  our revenues and profitability will be adversely affected  and we will not recover our development costs 
our success depends on developing and successfully marketing new games and gaming machines with strong and sustained player appeal 
a new game or gaming machine will be accepted by casino operators only if we can show that it is likely to produce more revenues to the operator than competitors products 
gaming machines can be installed in casinos on a trial basis  and only after a successful trial period are the machines purchased by the casinos 
if a new product does not achieve significant market acceptance  we may not recover our development and promotion costs 
we cannot assure you that the new products that we introduce will achieve any significant degree of market acceptance or that the acceptance will be sustained for any meaningful period 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our current schedule of planned introductions 
the gaming industry is sensitive to declines in the public acceptance of gaming that may lead to the passage of laws to significantly increase gaming taxes or outlaw gaming in affected jurisdictions 
the gaming industry can be affected by public opinion of gaming 
in the event that there is a decline in public acceptance of gaming  either through unfavorable legislation affecting the introduction of gaming into emerging markets  or through legislative and regulatory changes  including tax increases  in existing gaming markets  our ability to continue to sell and lease our games in those markets and jurisdictions would be adversely affected 
recent tax structure changes and rate increases in two jurisdictions have made gaming in general  and specifically participation games  less profitable 
we cannot assure you that public opinion will continue to support legalized gaming 
if we do not continually adapt to the rapid development of new technologies  we will not be able to successfully compete in our industry 
the gaming machine business is characterized by the rapid development of new technologies and the continuous introduction of new products using technologies that are new to the gaming industry 
we must continually adapt our products to incorporate new technologies 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to develop products using these new technologies 
patent infringement claims could limit or affect our ability to market some of our gaming machines 
our competitors have been granted patents covering numerous gaming machine features and bonusing techniques 
if our products use processes or other subject matter that is claimed under these existing patents  or if other companies obtain patents claiming subject matter that we use  those companies may bring infringement actions against us 
we might then be forced to discontinue the affected products or be required to obtain licenses from the company holding the patent  if it is willing  to give us a license  to develop  manufacture or market our products 
we also might then be limited in our ability to market new products 

table of contents if we do not obtain and retain licenses to use intellectual properties and licensors approvals of new products on a timely basis  our revenues will be adversely affected 
some of our most popular gaming machines are based on trademarks and other intellectual properties licensed from third parties 
our future success may depend upon our ability to obtain and retain licenses for additional popular intellectual properties 
there is competition for these licenses  and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in acquiring or retaining additional intellectual property rights with significant commercial value on acceptable terms 
these intellectual properties are licensed for a fixed term and generally provide for minimum guaranteed royalties 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to renew the intellectual properties that we currently license 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to create games using the intellectual properties that will generate enough revenues for us to cover the minimum guaranteed royalties and other fixed costs 
in the event that we cannot renew our existing licenses  we may be required to discontinue the participation games bearing the licensed marks 
our intellectual property licenses generally require that we submit new products developed under these licenses to the licensor prior to release for approval at their sole discretion 
rejection or delay in approval of a product by a licensor could have a material adverse effect on our revenues  operating results and financial condition 
if we are unable to protect or retain our intellectual property and proprietary rights  our revenues may be adversely affected 
our success may depend in part on our ability to obtain trademark protection for the names or symbols under which we market our products and to obtain copyright protection and patent protection of our proprietary software and other game innovations 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to build and maintain goodwill in our trademarks or obtain trademark or patent protection  that any trademark  copyright or issued patent will provide competitive advantages for us or that our intellectual properties will not be successfully challenged or circumvented by competitors 
we also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know how 
we enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees regarding our trade secrets and proprietary information  but we cannot assure you that the obligation to maintain the confidentiality of our trade secrets or proprietary information will be honored 
despite various confidentiality agreements and other trade secret protections  our trade secrets and proprietary know how could become known to  or independently developed by  competitors 
the gaming machine market is intensely competitive  and some of our competitors have advantages over us in their ability to finance technology development and in obtaining favorable placement in casinos 
the gaming machine business is intensely competitive 
some of our competitors are large companies with greater financial  marketing and product development resources than ours 
in addition  new competitors may enter our key markets 
obtaining space and favorable placement on casino gaming floors is a competitive factor in our industry 
competitors with a larger installed base of gaming machines than ours have an advantage in retaining the most space and best positions in casinos 
these competitors may also have an advantage of being able to convert their installed machines to newer models in order to maintain their share of casino floor space 
in addition  some of our competitors have developed and sell or otherwise provide to customers wide area progressive systems or centralized player tracking and accounting systems which allow operators to accumulate accounting and performance data about the operation of gaming devices 
we do not currently offer a proprietary wide area progressive system or a centralized player tracking and accounting system 
we face risks associated with doing business in foreign markets related to political and economic instability and related foreign currency fluctuations 
we seek to grow through increasing our presence in foreign markets 
potential political and economic instability in foreign markets may adversely affect our ability to enter into or continue to do business in these markets 
unstable governments and changes in current legislation may affect the gaming market with respect 
table of contents to gaming regulation  taxation  and the legality of gaming in some markets 
in addition  fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  tariffs and other barriers may further impede our success in foreign markets 
we cannot assure you that foreign markets will remain politically and economically stable enough to continue as a potential source of revenues and profit to us 
if the implementation of our enterprise resource planning information system is not successful  our operations could be disrupted  and we may incur unanticipated costs 
we are implementing the first phase of our new enterprise resource planning information system and related procedures and controls  which we will use to operate our business 
any failures  difficulties or significant delays in implementing our new information systems could result in material adverse consequences to our business  including disruption of operations  loss of information and unanticipated increases in costs 
if we do not realize the value of licensed technology commitments  we may incur charges to earnings 
we have entered into several agreements to license intellectual property related to alternative solutions to address software anomalies as part of our technology improvement plan that as of june  had a total potential commitment of million 
if we determine that we may not realize the value of any of the commitments  we would record an immediate charge against earnings up to the full amount of these commitments in the period in which such determination is made

redstone could sell any or all of these shares at any time on the open market or to a person who wishes to acquire control of wms 
this potential change in control may require prior regulatory approval 
we cannot assure you that any such person would agree with our strategy and business goals described in this report 
the sale by mr 
redstone of a large number of shares could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
the use of our rights plan or blank check preferred stock would inhibit the acquisition of wms or have a dilutive effect on our stock 
rights plan 
under our rights plan  each share of our common stock has an accompanying right to purchase convertible preferred stock that permits each holder to purchase shares of our common stock at half price 
the rights become exercisable if any person or entity acquires beneficial ownership of or more of our common stock without approval of our board of directors 
we can redeem the rights at 
per right  subject to specified conditions  at any time 
the rights expire in april our board of directors could use this agreement as an anti takeover device to discourage  delay or prevent a change in control of wms 
the use of our rights plan may dilute our common stock 
blank check preferred stock 
our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of five million shares of preferred stock with designations  rights and preferences that may be determined from time to time by the board of directors 
accordingly  our board has broad power  without stockholder approval  to issue preferred stock with dividend  liquidation  conversion  voting or other rights that could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of our common stock 
our board of directors could use preferred stock to discourage  delay or prevent a change in control 
our board has no current plans  agreements or 
table of contents commitments to issue any shares of preferred stock 
the existence of the blank check preferred stock  however  could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
the substantial number of shares of common stock available for sale in the future could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
we have  authorized shares of common stock 
as of september    shares were issued  including  shares held in treasury 
on that date  we also had outstanding options to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock issuable at an average exercise price of per share and outstanding warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock issuable at an exercise price of per share 
if all of our issued and outstanding stock options and warrants were exercised as of that date   shares of our common stock would be outstanding 
if the holders of our convertible subordinated notes converted all of the notes   shares of our common stock would be issued 
if all of the notes were converted to common stock and all of the outstanding options and warrants were exercised   shares would still be available for issuance 
our board of directors has broad discretion to issue authorized but unissued shares  including discretion to issue shares in compensatory and acquisition transactions 
in addition  if we seek financing through the sale of our securities  our then current stockholders may suffer dilution in their percentage ownership of our common stock 
the future issuance  or even the potential issuance  of shares at a price below the then current market price may have a depressive effect on the future market price of our common stock

these options may be granted as incentive stock options  designed to meet the requirements of section of the internal revenue code  except for options granted under the and non qualified stock option plans  or they may be non qualified options that do not meet the requirements of that section 
the purpose of each of the plans is to encourage our employees and  under some of the plans  non employee directors  consultants and advisors to acquire an ownership interest in our common stock and to enable these individuals to realize benefits from an increase in the value of our common stock 
we believe that this benefit provides these individuals with greater incentive to work to improve our business and encourages their continued provision of services to us and  generally  promotes our interests and those of our stockholders 
the stock option committee determines which of the eligible directors  officers  employees  consultants and advisors receive stock options  the terms  including any vesting periods of the options  and the number of shares for which options are granted 
the option price per share with respect to each option is determined by the stock option committee and generally is not less than the fair market value of our common stock on the date on which the option is granted

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
significant events and trends technology improvement plan in january  we began to execute a three part technology improvement plan to stabilize and modernize our operating system software that runs our gaming devices 
in the first phase of the plan  we improved the stability of our operating system by introducing two upgrades  version for hopper based games and version for printer based games 
version was approved by mississippi regulators in june and has now been approved by all six of the north american gaming labs 
four jurisdictions mandated that we upgrade all of their wms gaming devices to version mississippi  nevada  puerto rico and ontario  canada 
we completed the upgrade of the hopper gaming devices in casinos to version in mississippi in june  puerto rico in december  nevada in january and ontario in august  regulatory approval of the version upgrade resulted in our obtaining our first new game approvals in nevada and mississippi in over months 
since its implementation  the version has been substantially more stable than previous software versions 
other regulators could require upgrades in the future 
we are making version available in other jurisdictions as an optional upgrade 
version  our printer upgrade version  was approved by gaming laboratories inc  or gli in march  and the nevada gaming authorities in september we have installed version in several riverboat and native american casinos which use gli and are currently upgrading our printer gaming machines installed in casinos in nevada to version 
nevada is currently the only jurisdiction requiring all printer games be upgraded to version 
other regulators may require upgrades in the future  and we are making version available in other jurisdictions as an optional upgrade 
despite this progress in stabilizing our legacy operating systems  we anticipate that our revenues from sales of new gaming devices through the december quarter will improve only modestly over the levels experienced in fiscal  as customers await the introduction of our new operating system and platform 
we expect continued strength from game conversion revenues in the next six months  as operators seek the benefits of our new games 
the second phase of our technology improvement plan is to introduce a new operating system and circuit board  and the plan continues on schedule 
called cpu nxt  the new operating system contains features and 
table of contents functionality currently demanded by our customers that our existing platform lacks 
in order to mitigate risk  we initially adopted a dual path development strategy for cpu nxt 
we have an internally developed version of cpu nxt and an alternative version of cpu nxt being developed externally by sdg 
both versions have been submitted to the six major north american gaming labs 
as a result of the positive response from the regulators to the first submission of the cpu nxt version designed by sdg  along with its superior technology  which facilitates more rapid game development and ease of future evolution  we have elected to commercialize the sdg developed version of cpu nxt instead of the internally developed version 
we received gli approval of cpu nxt in september and expect to receive approvals from the remaining north american gaming labs by march we submitted nine new games on cpu nxt to gli in august and received approvals for all of these games in september with the approval for cpu nxt and new games in hand  we have begun selling cpu nxt upgrade kits to those customers who want all the features and functionality of the new operating system without the cost of purchasing a new cabinet 
we expect first shipment of these kits in october we expect to receive approval from gli on our new bluebird cabinet in november with the remaining north american lab approvals expected by march we believe that some of our customers may wait to purchase our gaming devices until after we begin to offer cpu nxt in our new cabinet design  bluebird 
cpu nxt and bluebird includes additional features and functionality desired by our customers that are lacking in the version and operating systems and our current cabinet 
we are evaluating specifications and requirements for an even more advanced operating system that will be developed in the long term  third phase of the technology improvement plan 
we continue to refine the design and specifications to incorporate additional features we desire for this platform and have recently begun allocating more resources to this longer term effort 
new products and licenses in december and january  we received approval for new versions of the monopoly branded games in nevada and mississippi  version of our hollywood squares themed game for the nevada  riverboat and native american markets  and our pac man branded game in mississippi 
in the march quarter we received additional approvals for the following game themes pac man frenzy  hollywood squares version  and the first approvals of hollywood squares version  called the center square 
we also received the first approvals of the next version of our monopoly branded series  called free parking  ahead of schedule 
with these new approvals  we were able to update a portion of the installed base of games in the june quarter  which resulted in our average revenue per day increasing sequentially in the june quarter from the march quarter by 
we expect additional approvals for new game themes for these participation game series throughout fiscal we submitted the first version of our new mechanical reel spinning game platform  developed for use on our bluebird cabinet  to regulators in february we have now received approvals from three of the six north american gaming labs on the first submission and are preparing for a field trial in another jurisdiction 
we expect to submit the marketable version of this product line to the six north american gaming labs in october and expect to receive the first approvals for this platform in april we expect to submit the marketable version of the bluebird cabinet to the six north american gaming labs in october and we expect first approval from gli in november with approvals for cpu nxt  new games and the bluebird cabinet  we expect to ship our first complete new gaming devices in december in april  the nevada gaming commission approved us as an operator of inter casino linked systems  which was the first of several key steps in launching our proprietary wide area progressive  or wap  system 
a wap links multiple gaming devices in multiple locations 
we have since submitted the first 
table of contents associated equipment components of our wap system to the nevada and gli gaming labs 
our wap system will require three sets of approvals an associated equipment approval for the linked system itself  which we have recently submitted to the nevada and gli gaming labs  a wap enabled gaming device approval  and approval of the game theme 
we expect to begin the field trial of our wap system at the beginning of calendar  and to receive final regulatory approvals late in the june quarter  targeting product launch in july other recent matters on june  we issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due july  in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers  and granted to the initial purchasers of the notes an option to purchase up to an additional million aggregate principal amount of notes  which they exercised on july  the notes are convertible  at the option of the holders  into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of 
the notes are non callable for the entire seven year term 
the net proceeds of the offering will be used for working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes  which may include acquisitions and repurchase of shares of our common stock under our existing share buyback program 
in june  upon completion of the offering  the authorization of the existing share buyback program was expanded by million to million 
as part of our technology improvement plan  we have pursued alternative development strategies for each phase of the plan  including licensing technology from third parties 
for the short term phase of the plan  our internally developed version and operating systems have operated successfully to date in casinos in jurisdictions where they have been installed and  as a result  we no longer intend to implement an alternative operating system which was originally licensed  among other uses  to provide a back up during the short term phase of the plan 
in fiscal  we recorded a pre tax charge of million to write off this license agreement obligation 
we have an agreement with igt for the operation of survivor branded games on igt s wide area progressive system 
under this agreement we record in our consolidated financial statements our proportionate share of revenues and costs  and all of the assets we own and liabilities we incur  in connection with the operating activities under this agreement 
in fiscal  we expensed million pre tax related to an estimated impairment of the survivor intellectual property license  and million pre tax to write down the survivor inventory to its net realizable value 
at june   the remaining net book value of survivor related inventory and intellectual property assets and commitments for both companies was approximately million 
on may   we purchased rights to  restricted shares of our common stock for a purchase price of million 
this share price reflected a discount of per share from the closing market price on may  we recorded a pre tax charge in our statement of operations of million to reflect this transaction 
these restricted shares had been issued march  to mr 
louis j 
nicastro  our chairman of the board of directors and a non employee director in consideration for his service as chairman of the technology committee of the board of directors  which was established to provide enhanced oversight of the timely completion of the first phase of our technology improvement plan 
on june   we announced that we would allow our agreement with stargames corporation pty ltd  for exclusive north american distributorship rights to their rapid roulette table gaming product  to expire on june  we encountered several significant obstacles in bringing this product to market  including regulatory  technical  and customer acceptance issues 
as a result of the expiration of the agreement  we recorded a non cash pre tax charge of million in fiscal to write down rapid roulette inventory to net realizable value and write off distribution rights assets 

table of contents our effective income tax rate for fiscal includes a small net benefit stemming from the adjustment and settlement of prior year income tax returns with the internal revenue service and the resulting impact of various tax agreements between wms and its former subsidiary  midway 
we have now fully reserved our tax advance receivables from midway due to the uncertainty of the timing of the payback period 
in addition  due to the increase in our foreign business and research and development spending  the effective tax rate was favorably impacted by larger benefits from increased export sales and research and development tax credits 
critical accounting policies inventory obsolescence we value inventory based on estimates of potentially excess and obsolete inventory after considering forecasted demand and forecasted average selling prices 
however  forecasts are subject to revisions  cancellations and rescheduling 
in fiscal  we expect to introduce a new gaming platform  and it is reasonably possible that this will accelerate the obsolescence of existing product lines 
in addition  demand for parts inventory is subject to technical obsolescence 
inventory on hand in excess of forecasted demand is written down to net realizable value 
actual demand may differ from anticipated demand  and such differences may have a material effect on the financial statements 
participation gaming machine depreciation we depreciate our participation gaming machines and top boxes over a two year useful life to a small salvage value 
a material adverse impact could occur if the actual useful life of the participation games or top boxes is less than what was used in estimating depreciation expense  or if actual salvage value is less than the anticipated salvage value 
we plan to introduce our new bluebird cabinet style participation games in the june quarter 
we anticipate depreciating the bluebird gaming devices over three years with a small salvage value  and the top box over one year 
intellectual property valuation we license intellectual property from third parties that we use in some of our gaming machines 
as part of our contracts with the licensors  we typically provide a guaranteed minimum and prepayment of royalties and license fees  usually at the time the contract is signed  even though the product may not be introduced until months or years later 
we capitalize the prepaid royalty and license fees as other assets 
at june   the minimum guaranteed royalty payments totaled million of which million has been paid and the balance is payable over various periods up to three years 
in addition  the contracts provide for an additional million of contingent royalty payments based upon future events occurring 
total prepaid royalties at june  were million of which million is in other current assets and million is in other assets 
subsequent to june   we entered into new licensing agreements with guaranteed minimum royalties and commitments of million 
we begin to amortize prepaid royalties when the product is introduced  based upon contractual terms of the license agreements and as appropriate to match costs and related revenues 
if we determine that the products we develop will not fully recover the guaranteed minimum amounts  we would record an immediate charge against earnings once such determination is made 
licensed technology valuation as part of our technology improvement plan  as discussed above  we have pursued alternative strategies for each phase of the plan  including licensing technologies from third parties 
at june  our minimum guaranteed payments related to technology alternatives totaled million  which had been paid as advances with an additional million of contingent royalty payments subject to future events  and these amounts are included in the amounts described above 
if we determine that we will not realize the value of the guaranteed commitment for a particular licensed technology alternative  we will record an immediate charge against earnings  at the time of our determination  of up to million if all of the alternatives were to have no further value to us 

table of contents accrued liabilities we accrue expenses related to employee benefits  software anomalies and other contingencies based upon our best estimates of the costs that are probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable 
these estimates are updated monthly based on current information 
however  changes in estimates or actual expenses may exceed accrued amounts 
recently issued accounting standards we have adopted sfas no 
 sfas no 
 sfas no 
 sfas no 
 and fasi no 
as discussed in note to our financial statements 
such adoption did not have a material effect on our balance sheet  statement of operations or cash flows 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations we are not dependent on off balance sheet financing arrangements to fund our operations 
we utilize financing arrangements for operating leases of equipment and facilities  none of which are in excess of our current needs 
we also have minimum guaranteed royalty payments for intellectual property used in our gaming machines 
our obligations under these arrangements at june  were as follows payment due by period in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years convertible subordinated notes operating leases minimum royalty payments total subsequent to june   we entered into amended licensing agreements with contractual obligations totaling million  due as follows million less than year  million years  million years  million more than years 
the total potential royalty commitments  including payments already made and those contingent upon future events  decreased from million at june  to million at june  please refer to note to our financial statements in this report for additional details 
we do not have any special purpose entities for investment or the conduct of our operations 
we do have an agreement with igt related to the operation of survivor branded participation games on its wide area progressive system  under which we record in our consolidated financial statements our proportionate share of revenues and costs from operating activities under that agreement  and the full value of assets we own and liabilities we incur in connection with the operating activities 
we have not entered into any derivative financial instruments  although we have granted stock options and restricted stock to our employees  officers  directors and consultants and warrants to a licensor 
we do not currently have any significant firm purchase commitments for raw material inventory 
liquidity and capital resources we believe that cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of million at june   exclusive of million of restricted cash  along with our available million bank revolving line of credit that extends to may   and cash flow from operations  will be adequate to fund the anticipated level of expenses  capital expenditures  cash to be invested in participation games  and the levels of inventories and receivables required in the operation of our business for the next twelve months 
our cash balance on june  reflects million we received in a private placement of convertible subordinated notes due july  in july  subsequent to the end of fiscal  we received an additional million upon the exercise of the over allotment option granted to the initial purchaser of the notes 
net proceeds from the sale of the notes will be used for working capital  capital expenditures and other 
table of contents general corporate purposes  which may include acquisitions or repurchases of shares of our common stock under our existing million stock buyback program 
our short term investments primarily consist of auction market preferred stocks stated at cost  which approximates market value 
these investments generally have no fixed maturity date but most have dividend reset dates every days or more 
these investments can be liquidated under an auction process on the dividend reset dates subject to a sufficient number of bids being submitted 
our policy is to invest cash with issuers that have a high credit rating and to limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
due to our operating loss in fiscal  we have million of current income tax receivables on our balance sheet as of june  this tax receivable is based on our ability to receive tax refunds from applying our fiscal loss against prior years income and for refunds of tax payments made in fiscal we also have million of deferred tax assets on our balance sheet as of june  these represent taxable temporary differences expected to reverse in future years  and tax credits and operating losses generated in fiscal that can be claimed on future returns to reduce current tax due in those years 
we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of these deferred tax assets 
on this basis  we have not provided any valuation allowance as of june  however  valuation allowances could be recorded against these deferred tax assets in future periods if our future estimates of amounts realizable are reduced 
cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal  which was million less than the million of cash provided for fiscal the decrease was due to an million decrease in net income from million net income in fiscal to a net loss of million in fiscal and a million decrease in changes in operating assets and liabilities from million cash inflow in fiscal to million cash inflow in fiscal  partially offset by a million increase in depreciation expense

the cash flow from changes in operating assets and liabilities for fiscal was an inflow of million due to an million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  a million decrease in inventory  largely offset by a million increase in other assets from the comparable balances at june  the largest component of the increase in other assets was a million increase in long term prepaid royalties due to advance payments made on brand and technology licensing agreements 
the increase in current liabilities includes a million accrued liability to our former subsidiary  midway  related to our tax sharing and tax separation agreements 
cash inflow for fiscal was primarily due to a decrease in receivables  as a result of lower sales  and inventories  partially offset by an increase in other current assets 
we have not experienced significant bad debt expense in any of the periods presented 
we anticipate continued low levels of cash provided by operating activities over the next six months due to decreased game sales and higher research and development expenses to implement our technology improvement plan and product line expansion plans 
cash used for investing activities was million for fiscal  compared with million for fiscal cash used for the purchase of property  plant and equipment for fiscal year was million compared with million for the comparable prior year period

in april  our board of directors authorized a new twelve month plan to repurchase up to an additional million of our common stock from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions 
in june  in conjunction with the completion of our million convertible subordinated notes offering  our board of directors authorized an expansion of the existing million common stock repurchase plan to million 
during the fiscal year ended june   we repurchased  shares for an aggregate price of million under all of these programs

the decrease in gaming operations revenue was due to a decrease in the average installed base of participation games to a total of  units in fiscal  compared to  units installed in fiscal  while the actual installed base declined from  units at june  to  units at june  we believe the decline in the installed base resulted from three factors 
first  in the first half of fiscal  the average net win of our participation games decreased and casino operators removed games as we were unable to obtain approvals for new games as gaming regulators reviewed upgrades to our legacy operating system 
second  we removed participation games from locations that had low net revenue per day 
third  the decline in the installed base resulted from our current gaming platform not supporting key features and functionality that casino operators now demand  such as some cashless gaming options  multi denomination and tokenization  as well as an increasingly competitive environment

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risks in the ordinary course of our business  primarily associated with interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations 
we do not currently hedge either of these risks  or utilize financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes
