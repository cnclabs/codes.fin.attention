item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general 
our profitability from operations in any particular reporting period will be directly related to the average realized prices of oil and gas sold  the volume of oil and gas produced and the results of acquisition  development and exploration activities 
the average realized prices of oil and gas will fluctuate from one period to another due to market conditions and the results of the company s hedging activities 
the aggregate amount of oil and gas produced may fluctuate based on our development and exploitation of oil and gas reserves and other factors 
production rates  value based production taxes  labor and maintenance expenses are expected to be the principal influences on operating costs 
accordingly  our results of operations may fluctuate from period to period 
equity uses the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and natural gas activities 
under this method  only the cost of successful efforts are capitalized as oil and gas properties 
costs of exploratory dry holes  geological and geophysical costs  delay rentals  general and administrative costs associated with our exploration efforts and other property carrying costs are expensed as incurred 
prices received from the sale of oil and natural gas during were higher than the prices that were in effect at year end the prices received for our oil vary from nymex prices based on the location and quality of the crude oil 
the prices we receive for our natural gas are based upon posted prices in the area where the gas is produced  reduced by transportation charges and processing fees 
transportation costs are comprised of costs paid to a carrier to deliver oil or natural gas to a specified delivery point 
oil and natural gas production costs are composed of lease operating expense and production taxes 
lease operating expense consists of pumpers salaries  utilities  maintenance and other costs necessary to operate our producing properties 
production taxes are assessed by applicable taxing authorities as a percentage of revenues 
exploration expense consists of geological and geophysical costs  delay rentals and cost of unsuccessful exploratory wells 
delay rentals and some overhead costs are typically fixed in nature in the short term 
however  other exploration costs are generally discretionary and exploration activity levels are determined by a number of factors  including oil and natural gas prices  availability of funds  quantity and character of investment projects  availability of service providers and competition 
production and exploration overhead expense consists of exploration staff overhead costs  technical and production office expenses and production staff overhead costs that are not directly billed to our producing properties 
depletion  depreciation and amortization of capitalized costs of producing oil and natural gas properties is computed using the unit of production method based on proved reserves 
for purposes of computing depletion  proved reserves are redetermined as of the end of each year 
because the economic life of each producing well depends upon assumed prices  fluctuations in oil and gas prices impact the level of proved reserves 
higher prices generally have the effect of increasing reserves  which reduces depletion  while lower prices generally have the effect of decreasing reserves  which increases depletion expense 
critical accounting policies a summary of our significant accounting policies is included in footnote of our financial statements 
we believe the application of these accounting policies on a consistent basis enables us to provide timely and reliable financial information about our earnings results  financial condition and cash flows 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make judgements  estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts presented and disclosed in the financial statements 
our management reviews these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience  changes in business conditions and other relevant factors that they believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
in any given reporting period  actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used in preparing our financial statements 
critical accounting policies are those that may have a material impact on our financial statements and also require management to exercise significant judgement due to a high degree of uncertainty at the time the estimate is made 
our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our accounting policies  related accounting estimates and the disclosures set forth below with the audit committee of our board of directors 
we believe our critical accounting policies include those addressing the recoverability and useful lives of assets  oil and gas reserve estimates and income taxes 
the computation of the company s income tax expense requires the interpretation of complex tax laws and regulations in many taxing jurisdictions in the united states and canada as well as any possible assessments due to audit findings that may be performed by numerous taxing authorities 
actual income tax expense can differ significantly from management s estimates 
oil and gas reserves estimates of reserve quantities and related future net cash flows are calculated using unescalated year end oil and gas prices and operating costs  and may be subject to substantial fluctuations based on the prices in effect at the end of each year 
the following table sets forth a comparison of year end reserves  the weighted average prices used in calculating estimated reserve quantities and future net cash flows  pre tax future net cash flows discounted at  and per barrel of oil equivalent discounted cash flows at the end of  and quantities in thousands  except for pricing and per barrel of oil equivalent amounts year end proved reserves year end prices sec pre tax values per boe sec pre tax values oil mbbls gas mmcf boe oil gas gas converted at  mcf per barrel 
reserve revisions occur  among other things  when the economic limit of a property is lengthened or shortened due to changes in commodity pricing 
the following table shows the effect of changing oil prices on the volume of oil reserves shown in thousands of barrels year ended december  proved oil reserves s beginning of year    revisions of previous estimates   extensions and discoveries improved recovery  acquisition of minerals in place sales of minerals in place production end of year    oil prices increased from year end to year end vs 
 respectively 
the upward revision of  in and  in and the downward revision of  in were primarily price related 
excluding revisions to previous estimates  our drilling and acquisition activities added  barrels of oil equivalent reserves  of total oil and gas production 
in  we replaced of our total oil and natural gas production through our drilling and acquisition activities 
in  drilling and acquisition activities added  barrels of oil equivalent to our proved reserve base  replacing of production 
further information concerning our reserve volumes and values can be found in footnote to the financial statements 
impairment of proved oil and gas properties we assess our proved properties on a field by field basis for impairment  in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  whenever events or circumstances indicate that the capitalized cost of oil and natural gas properties may not be recoverable 
when making such assessments  we compare the expected undiscounted future net revenues on a field by field basis with the related net capitalized costs at the end of each period 
when the net capitalized costs exceed the undiscounted future net revenues  the cost of the property is written down to fair value  which is determined using discounted future net revenues 
reserve categories used in the impairment analysis considered all categories of proven reserves and probable and possible reserves  which are risk adjusted based on our drilling plans and history of successfully developing those types of reserves 
during  we recorded an impairment of oil and gas properties of  associated with certain properties that experienced increased operating costs  declining production  reduced prospectivity due to unsuccessful drilling  and other technical problems that reduced their economic reserves 
during and  we recorded impairment charges of  and  respectively 
results of operations comparison of with oil and gas production and sales 
gas volumes from the gas properties acquired in offset slightly lower oil volumes and lower natural gas prices as compared to this allowed the company to record oil and gas sales of  in compared to  in  an increase 
gas revenues from the assets acquired in were approximately million 
we periodically enter into hedging activities for a portion of our oil and natural gas production as a requirement of our new bank credit facility  to support our oil and natural gas price at targeted levels and to manage our exposure to price fluctuations 
starting in may we had commodity price hedges in place for  barrels of oil a day and  mmbtu of natural gas per day under costless collars 
the settlement price of each of the contracts during the year resulted in the company making payments to the counterparty of approximately  these payments are netted against oil and gas revenues 
no such payments were made in as we had no volumes of oil or natural gas subject to hedging agreements 
as of january   we had  barrels of oil per day thru april  and  mmbtu of natural gas per day  mmbtu thru april  and  mmbtu thru december  subject to hedging arrangements under costless collars 
year end company received commodity prices were much higher than the prior year end in compared to in for oil and in compared to in for natural gas 
however  average oil prices received for the full year were only slightly higher compared to the prior year 
the average price received was per barrel 
after taking into consideration the hedging costs discussed above  the average oil price received in was per barrel 
average received gas prices were down sharply for when compared to after taking into consideration the hedging costs discussed above  the average gas price received in was per mcf compared to per mcf in or a decrease 
oil production remained relatively constant from  barrels in to  barrels in gas production in was substantially higher in when compared to   mcf compared to  mcf last year 
the oil production decline is attributable to normal production declines as our properties mature 
the increase in gas production is attributable to the acquisition of the sacramento basin gas properties during the year 
production from the acquired properties was approximately bcf of gas 
other income 
included in other income is  in non recurring property sales recognized in the first quarter of the year 
in these non recurring property sales were minimal 
lease operating costs 
operating costs in increased by or about million 
costs associated with the acquired gas properties accounted for approximately million of the increase 
the additional increase results from an adjustment in the fourth quarter of to reverse the accrual of  of prior years production taxes and other operating costs 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a 
dd a per unit charges increased from per boe in to per boe in this increase is the result dd a attributable to the acquired gas properties 
the acquired gas properties have a shorter life than our other assets thus dd a on a per unit basis increased 
dd a charges attributable to the acquired assets was approximately million 
impairment of proved oil and gas properties 
as discussed previously  included in the statement of operations for and are non cash charges for the impairment of proved oil and gas properties in the amount of  and  respectively 
d seismic and exploration expenses 
we participated in one new d seismic survey during the survey was a square mile survey adjacent to our south west beaver creek prospect in north dakota 
our share of the cost  approximately  was charged to expense during the year 
during we participated in two surveys with higher working interests resulting in an expense of approximately  higher exploration costs in reflected higher dry hole costs incurred during the year 
we drilled two dry holes in compared to five in the prior year 
the majority of the dry hole expense was associated with one well in which we had a working interest 
the working interest percentages for all of the dry holes in were much lower than 
dry hole costs in were approximately  higher than the amount recorded in general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were unchanged from the prior year 
costs incurred in both and were about million 
lower compensation related costs and other administrative costs in were offset by higher insurance expense  shareholder costs and costs associated with the pursuit of acquisition and divestiture opportunities during the year 
production and exploration overhead expense 
production and exploration overhead expenses are salaries and benefits for employees who oversee our production and exploration activities and costs related to maintaining our technical office in denver  colorado and our operations office in cody  wyoming 
these costs were only slightly lower in when compared to  million compared to million 
interest and income taxes 
higher interest costs in reflect higher balances outstanding under our credit facility 
the increase in the amount outstanding resulted from our property acquisition 
the acquisition was paid for through borrowing approximately million dollars during the second quarter of income tax expense for both periods reflects the results of operations  as well as the utilization of various credits and other tax attributes 
details concerning the components of the tax provision can be found in footnote to the financial statements 
other comprehensive loss 
other comprehensive loss for the period reflects the fair value of our commodity hedges  net of income taxes  that were in place at december  the fair value is computed by the counterparty using a financial modeling technique including a type of black scholes method 
the counterparty valued the hedges at december  at 
this amount is included in the balance sheet as fair value of financial instruments and the tax effected amount   is reported in other comprehensive income 
we do not intend to terminate our current commodity hedges prior to their expiration date 
comparison of with oil and gas production and sales 
lower fourth quarter commodity prices resulted in lower oil and natural gas revenues for oil and gas sales for the year of  were lower than those recorded in  as year end average oil and gas prices were and lower  respectively 
during we had no volumes of oil or natural gas subject to hedging agreements 
revenues were reduced by  in by costs associated with our hedging program 
while we may hedge future volumes as a means to mitigate price risk and or to ensure the availability of capital to fund our drilling programs  there was no requirement to hedge under our previous banking arrangement during as of january   we had no volumes of oil or gas subject to hedging arrangements 
the average oil price received for was per barrel  down from the prior year 
after taking into consideration the hedging costs discussed above  the average oil price received in was per barrel 
gas prices were up sharply the first half of  however prices declined substantially during the second half resulting in an average price of per mcf for the entire year 
this compared to per mcf in or a increase 
oil production declined from  barrels in to  barrels in gas production in was  mcf compared to  mcf in the oil production decline is attributable to normal production declines as our properties mature 
the reduction in gas production was due in part to our reduced drilling program and reduced drilling success in california during other income 
included in other income is  in non recurring property sales recognized in the first quarter of the year 
in these non recurring property sales were only  we also recognized gains in on the sale of securities held for investment and revenue from property promotions that were non recurring 
lease operating costs 
operating costs in were unchanged from levels due to the fourth quarter reversal of prior years production taxes and other operating costs that had been previously accrued by the company 
the adjustment during the fourth quarter  to reflect the settlement of these previously estimated costs was approximately  without this reversal  operating costs would have increased approximately from the prior year 
the most significant factor leading to this increase was lease operating expenses associated with plugging and abandonment charges for old inactive wells in some of our mature oil fields 
additionally  higher oil and gas prices during the first half of the year resulted in higher value based production taxes 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a 
dd a per unit charges increased from per boe in to per boe in this increase is the result of lower year end commodity prices which reduced year end reserves and resulted in a higher unit of production depletion rate for the fourth quarter of impairment of proved oil and gas properties 
as discussed previously  included in the statement of operations for and are non cash charges for the impairment of proved oil and gas properties in the amount of  and  respectively 
d seismic and exploration expenses 
we participated in four new d seismic surveys during the first was a square mile survey at our south west beaver creek prospect in north dakota 
the second was a mile survey at the north ellsworth prospect also in north dakota 
the costs of both surveys  approximately  were charged to expense during the year 
the other two surveys were conducted over producing areas and thus costs were capitalized to the cost of the producing properties 
the capitalized cost was approximately  we participated in two d seismic surveys during the cost of approximately  was charged to expense in lower exploration costs in reflected lower dry hole costs incurred during the year 
we drilled one less dry hole in than in additionally the wells drilled in carried an average lower working interest than those of the previous year 
dry hole costs in were approximately  lower than the amount recorded in general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased from levels 
the increase was due to higher compensation resulting from bonus payments  fees paid to an employee search firm associated with hiring a new vice president of corporate development  employee relocation costs for two new employees  and higher shareholder expenses 
production and exploration overhead expense 
production and exploration overhead expenses increased in from levels  million in compared to million in the primary factor causing this increase was higher salary and benefit costs during interest and income taxes 
lower interest costs in reflect lower balances outstanding under our credit facility and lower interest rates on the outstanding balance 
during  we reduced our credit facility debt by  income tax expense for both periods reflects the results of operations  as well as the utilization of various credits and other tax attributes 
details concerning the components of the tax provision can be found in footnote to the financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources during the year we secured a new million credit facility for the purpose of acquiring certain gas properties in california 
the acquisition of these assets closed in april for approximately million 
this represented the largest capital expenditure outlay in our year history 
even though we are more highly leveraged than at any time in our history  we believe the cash flow from these acquired properties will support the amount of debt outstanding 
further  the additional cash flow will give us opportunities to continue to grow the asset value of the company 
our cash balances increased by from the amount at december  our current assets to current liabilities ratio excluding the accrued liability for fair value of financial instruments increased to to at december  compared to to at the end of these increases are due to additional oil and gas receivables primarily attributable to the california gas acquisition and higher prices in effect at year end when compared to additionally  year end reflected accrued expenses in connection with the aggressive drilling activities we pursued during the fourth quarter of that year 
capital expenditures increased over levels  reaching approximately million in million of these costs were for the acquired properties as discussed above 
our new million revolving credit facility with bank one texas  na was secured in april the facility has a current commitment of million 
the facility has a libor or a prime interest rate option  the weighted average interest rate on debt outstanding at december  was percent 
the commitment under our credit facility is subject to a redetermination as of april and october of each year  with estimated future oil and gas prices used in the evaluation determined by the lender 
as of december   we had  of remaining availability on the facility 
we are in compliance with all facility covenants 
excess cash flows in enabled us to pay down our debt to at year end 
should we have cash flows in excess of our capital requirements for  additional reductions of outstanding debt may occur 
cash flow from operating activities of  was higher than the amount recorded during increased oil and gas revenues was the primary driver for the increase 
accounts receivable at year end were approximately million which was million higher than at year end the increase is related to gas sales from the acquired assets and higher year end commodity prices 
the decrease in accounts payable in reflected less drilling activity at the end of the year when compared to year end income taxes receivable decreased due to refunds that were received as a result of the tax net operating loss incurred in the prior year 
we believe that our capital resources from existing cash balances  cash flow from operating activities  and funds available under our credit facility are adequate to meet the requirements of our business 
however  future cash flows are subject to a number of variables  including the level of production and oil and natural gas prices 
we cannot assure that operations and other capital resources will provide cash in sufficient amounts to maintain planned levels of capital expenditures or that increased capital expenditures will not be undertaken 
we believe we have adequate liquidity to maintain our operations as they currently exist 
contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments 
we have no significant off balance sheet transactions or similar instruments and we are not a guarantor of any other entities debt of other financial obligations 
the following table sets forth payments due by period for contractual obligations as of december  total years revolving credit facility   recently issued financial accounting standards we have reviewed all recently issued  but not yet adopted accounting standards in order to determine their effects  if any  on the results of our operations or financial position 
based on that review  we are continuing to evaluate the impact of adopting sfas and we believe that all other pronouncements will not have any significant effects on our future earnings or operations 
further discussion of recently issued accounting standards is found in footnote to the financial statements 
forward looking statements the preceding discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
except for the historical information contained herein  the matters discussed in this annual report contain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  that are based on management s beliefs and assumptions  current expectations  estimates  and projections 
statements that are not historical facts  including without limitation statements which are preceded by  followed by or include the words believes  anticipates  plans  expects  may  should or similar expressions are forward looking statements 
many of the factors that will determine our future results are beyond the ability of the company to control or predict 
these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and  therefore  actual results may differ materially 
all subsequent written and oral forward looking statements attributable to equity  or persons acting on its behalf  are expressly qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements 
we disclaim any obligation to update any forward looking statements whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
important factors that may affect future results include  but are not limited to drilling success  the risk of a significant natural disaster  our inability to insure against certain risks  fluctuations in commodity prices  the inherent limitations in the ability to estimate oil and gas reserves  changing government regulations  as well as general market conditions  competition and pricing  and other risks detailed from time to time in our sec reports  copies of which are available upon request from our investor relations department 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of the following information is to provide forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks 
we are exposed to various market risks  principally fluctuating interest rates and changes in commodity prices 
these risks can impact our results of operations  cash flows and financial position 
we manage these risks through regular operating and financing activities and periodically use derivative financial instruments such as commodity price hedging agreements 
the following analysis presents the effect earnings  cash flows and financial position as if the hypothetical changes in market risk factors occurred on december  only the potential impacts of hypothetical assumptions are analyzed 
this analysis does not consider other possible effects that could impact our business 
interest rate risk 
at december  the amount outstanding under our credit facility was million 
the weighted average interest rate for this facility was 
assuming constant debt levels  earnings and cash flow impacts for the next twelve month period from december  due to a one percent change in interest rates would be approximately  before taxes 
commodity price risk 
oil and gas commodity markets are influenced by global as well as regional supply and demand 
worldwide political events can also impact commodity prices 
pricing for oil and natural gas production has been volatile and unpredictable for many years 
in accordance with our current lending facility and to hedge exposure to changing commodity prices we periodically entering into financial hedge contracts 
hedging may limit the company s exposure to adverse price limits  hedging also limits the benefit of price increases and is subject to a number of risks  including credit risk of the counterparty to the hedge 
for additional information  see note to the financial statements 
the terms of our current credit facility require that not later than thirty days subsequent to the date of the new facility april  not less than of our projected monthly production be hedged at price levels and terms acceptable to the lender 
during  the company made net payments to the counterparty of  under the hedge agreements in place 
this amount is netted against our oil and gas revenue 
we had no volumes subject to hedging agreements in we account for our hedging activity pursuant to sfas  accordingly we include the fair value of these hedges  liability at december  on our balance sheet 
fair value represents the value computed by the counterparty using a financial modeling technique including a type of black scholes method 
as these contracts qualify and have been designated as cash flow hedges  we determine gains and losses on them resulting from market price changes at least quarterly and reflect them in accumulated other comprehensive income loss until the period in which the hedge is settled 
at that time  the amount paid to or received from the counterparty is included in oil and gas revenue 
we do not intend to terminate our current commodity hedges prior to their expiration date 
the hedges we had in place at december  were costless collars 
the company utilizes collars that establish a price between a floor and ceiling to hedge oil and natural gas prices 
the table below sets forth our oil and natural gas collars in place at december  time period per day bbl mmbtu average floor bbl mmbtu average ceiling bbl mmbtu fair value of financial instrument asset liability thousands oil gas
