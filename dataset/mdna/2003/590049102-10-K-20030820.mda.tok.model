item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are a leading manufacturer of technologically advanced electronic interconnect solutions for use in sophisticated electronic equipment 
our principal products are complex multilayer printed circuit boards  which are the platforms used to interconnect microprocessors  integrated circuits and other components that are essential to the operation of electronic products and systems 
our fiscal year consists of either the or week period ending on the last saturday in may 
fiscal year was a week year and fiscal years and were week years 
for convenience  financial information for all of our fiscal years is presented as ended on may throughout fiscal  we executed strategies designed to position us for future growth 
we continued to advance the technology of our printed circuit boards  which is reflected in a higher average layer count for boards sold during the year  and we enhanced our quick turn capabilities 
we expanded our market share with the addition of a significant number of new customers and many new programs with existing customers 
we broadened our international footprint with the establishment of a sales presence in europe and china 
however  the sustained industry downturn has resulted in a prolonged under utilization of manufacturing capacity and competitive pricing pressures 
in response  we focused on reducing our cost structure and improving productivity throughout our operations 
although our capacity expansion program has been suspended  we are positioned to complete the project to support the needs of our customer base as demand returns 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect i the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  ii the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and iii the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate and update our estimates and judgments  including those related to the collectibility of accounts receivable  realizability of inventories  impairment of long lived assets  amount of warranty obligations and valuation of deferred income tax assets 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among other policies  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable the company recognizes revenue upon the shipment of its products to the customer provided that the company has received a purchase order  the price is fixed  title has transferred  product returns are reasonably estimable  collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured  there are no customer acceptance requirements and there are no remaining significant performance obligations 
we maintain an allowance for estimated product returns based on historical experience 
we also maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
this estimate is based on historical experience  current economic and industry conditions and the profile of our customer mix 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances could be required 

table of contents inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market and include materials  labor and manufacturing overhead 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketability in amounts equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market value based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions were to be less favorable than we projected  additional inventory write downs could be required 
long lived assets we review long lived assets for impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
factors which could trigger an impairment review include a significant decline in operating results relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of assets  changes in technology or significant negative industry or economic trends 
if this review indicates that the value of an asset may be impaired  we make an evaluation of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life 
if this evaluation indicates that the value of the asset is not recoverable  the net carrying value of the asset will be reduced to fair value and the remaining depreciation period may be adjusted 
any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements if and when an impairment charge is recorded 
warranty we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
the warranty obligation includes a provision based on historical experience  as well as reserves for specific issues we identify 
to the extent actual warranty charges vary from our historical experience  we may revise the estimated warranty liability 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method 
under the asset and liability method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
an adjustment to the deferred tax assets is charged to income in the period such a determination is made 
in fiscal  we recorded a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets because of recent operating losses 
as the company returns to profitability  we will reverse the valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets  which will result in a reduction of income tax expense 

table of contents results of operations results of operations information in thousands of dollars and as a percentage of net sales are as follows years ended may  percentage of net sales net sales cost of sales gross profit loss operating expenses engineering selling  general and administrative restructuring and related activities total operating expenses operating income loss interest income interest expense other expense  net income loss before taxes income tax expense benefit net income loss comparison of fiscal years and net sales net sales were million in fiscal  an increase of from net sales of million in fiscal the increase in net sales resulted from an increase in unit shipments that offset lower average pricing 
unit shipments were higher in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in unit shipments is largely due to shipments to new customers and partly due to a higher level of orders from existing customers 
beginning in january  we aggressively pursued new customers to utilize excess capacity that became available in our facility as a result of the downturn in the electronics industry 
this strategy contributed to our volume increase in fiscal  as approximately one third of revenues in fiscal were attributable to customers that were added since january volume gains were partially offset by a decrease in average pricing in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in average pricing is a result of product mix changes as well as competitive pressures on pricing for both quick turn and volume orders 
product mix changes affect average pricing as pricing on circuit boards varies significantly based on board complexity  materials used and assembly requirements 
in general  average pricing is higher for boards that utilize high speed laminate materials or thermal management solutions  as these boards require higher cost materials 
sales of these higher priced boards as a percent of total sales have declined slightly in fiscal as compared to the prior year due to product mix changes resulting from shifts in customer demand 
competitive pricing pressures are driven primarily by excess industry capacity due to the extended decline in end market demand in the electronics industry 
printed circuit board manufacturers have aggressively reduced prices in efforts to increase sales volumes and cover the large fixed costs associated with maintaining production capacity 
until industry conditions improve and supply and demand become more balanced  we expect that lower average pricing will continue to negatively affect our sales 
quick turn revenue  consisting of quick turn prototype  pre production and compressed lead time volume orders  comprised of net sales in fiscal  compared to in fiscal the decrease in quick turn revenue as a percent of sales primarily reflects a decline in market pricing for quick turn prototype orders and an 
table of contents increase in volume sales in fiscal quick turn revenue in both fiscal and fiscal consisted principally of quick turn prototype and pre production orders  as opposed to compressed lead time volume orders 
sales in the communications end market remains our primary focus representing of sales in fiscal and sales to our five largest oem customers comprised of our net sales in fiscal  compared to in fiscal our sales to oems include sales made through contract manufacturers 
sales through contract manufacturers were of our net sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal two customers each accounted for more than of our net sales in fiscal and see business markets and customers 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we experienced relatively higher levels of sales orders compared to the prior quarters and our capacity utilization rates increased to over 
however  pricing for both quick turn and volume orders remains very competitive 
future demand and product pricing will depend on many factors including product mix  levels of advanced technology  capacity utilization  competitive pressure in the circuit board industry  and economic conditions affecting the electronics industry in general and the markets we serve 
gross loss gross loss as a percentage of net sales was in fiscal and in fiscal gross loss increased in fiscal primarily due to the decrease in average pricing 
see net sales above 
the increase in gross loss was partially offset by an increase in manufacturing capacity utilization  a lower cost structure and increased productivity 
manufacturing capacity utilization improved due to increased product demand from new and existing customers 
higher capacity utilization enhances gross margin because fixed costs are spread over a higher number of units produced which decreases the cost per unit 
the lower cost structure primarily resulted from reduced headcount through lay offs and attrition  reductions in vendor pricing for materials and other cost reduction actions 
in addition  we have started to realize cost savings associated with the restructuring and related activities  which were primarily completed in the third quarter of fiscal productivity gains were achieved through process re engineering that resulted in an increase in unit output with reduced headcount 
the decrease in labor expense was partially offset by an additional week of expense in fiscal and mandated time off in fiscal that was not repeated in fiscal until industry demand increases  we expect gross margin will continue to be negatively affected by competitive product pricing 
our gross profit or loss may also be affected by other factors  including changes in our product mix  production yields  and changes in our cost structure 
engineering our engineering expenses were million in fiscal and million in fiscal  representing of our net sales in both years 
the increase in engineering expense in fiscal resulted primarily from the fiscal capitalization of qualified internal engineering costs related to our capacity expansion project and increased labor expense due to mandated time off in fiscal that was not repeated in fiscal the cost of engineering materials and supplies also increased due to the evaluation and testing required to support increased demands for higher technology product development and enhanced quick turn capabilities 
increases in engineering expenses were partially offset by a decrease in average headcount from the prior year 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses were million or of net sales and million or of net sales in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expense primarily resulted from increased labor expenses 
although net headcount has decreased  salary 
table of contents expenses have increased due to strategic hires to strengthen the organization  higher variable compensation due to higher sales  and mandated time off in fiscal that was not repeated in fiscal restructuring and related activities during the second half of fiscal  the company executed a restructuring plan that consisted of a voluntary layoff of approximately employees from both production and support groups and the relocation of certain finishing  test and shipping operations from a satellite production facility to our main campus in forest grove 
this relocation has had a positive impact on our cost structure  cycle time  and productivity 
in addition  the company recorded a related charge for impaired assets that resulted from the restructuring 
the plan was completed by the end of fiscal and a charge of million was recorded for restructuring and related activities 
the charge consisted of  related to severance costs   related to production relocation and  related to asset impairment 
severance costs included  of compensation expense recorded due to the modification of the terms of stock options held by employees that participated in the voluntary layoff 
approximately million of the total charge was a cash charge 
interest income interest income decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due to the decline in our investment balances and the lower yield on those balances as a result of lower interest rates 
interest expense interest expense increased to million in fiscal from  in fiscal primarily due to the capitalization of  of interest costs related to capacity expansion projects in fiscal that was not repeated in fiscal capitalized interest is amortized over the lives of the buildings and equipment to which it relates 
other expense  net other expense  net  increased to  in fiscal  compared to  in fiscal  primarily due to certain non operating charges for outside services recorded in fiscal  partially offset by one time costs associated with early retirement of debt of  recorded in fiscal income taxes the provision for income taxes for fiscal of million is primarily the result of a million charge to income tax expense recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal  representing a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
see note to the financial statements included in this report 
excluding this charge  our effective tax rate was a benefit of in fiscal compared to a benefit of in fiscal these effective rates include the benefit of research and development tax credits recognized for the current and prior fiscal years 
as we return to profitability  we will reverse the deferred tax asset valuation allowance  which will result in a reduction of future income tax expense 
we do not expect to recognize tax benefit or expense on operating results in fiscal comparison of fiscal years and net sales net sales were million in fiscal  a decrease of from net sales of million in fiscal this decrease was primarily due to the downturn in the electronics industry and the resulting decline in oem customer demand 
unit shipments declined by in fiscal as compared to the prior year 
the 
table of contents decrease was slightly offset by a improvement in average pricing resulting from a higher level of quick turn prototype sales and a higher percentage of more technologically advanced printed circuit board sales compared to the prior year 
quick turn revenue comprised of net sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal  however  in fiscal it consisted principally of prototype and pre production orders  while quick turn revenue in fiscal was principally comprised of compressed lead time volume orders 
consistent with industry conditions  we experienced a sustained downturn in customer demand for volume orders during fiscal however  as a result of enhancing our quick turn capabilities  we achieved a significant increase in the level of higher margin prototype orders during the year 
sales in the communications end market increased as a percentage of sales in fiscal compared to fiscal  due to the increase in the number of communications customers 
sales in our test and measurement and high end computing end market decreased as a percentage of sales due to reduced demand in those end markets as well as the significant growth in the number of new communications customers 
sales to our five largest oem customers comprised of our net sales in fiscal  compared to in fiscal our sales to oems include sales made through contract manufacturers 
sales through contract manufacturers were of our net sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal two customers each accounted for more than of our net sales in fiscal  and three customers each accounted for more than of our net sales in fiscal see business markets and customers 
gross profit loss gross profit loss as a percentage of sales  or gross margin  was a loss of in fiscal and a profit of in fiscal gross margin decreased in fiscal primarily due to the significant decrease in sales and resulting decrease in manufacturing capacity utilization 
decreased production volumes required fixed costs to be allocated over a lower number of units 
partially offsetting the negative impact of lower volumes was stronger pricing year over year resulting from a favorable sales mix 
see net sales 
in addition  we implemented cost cutting measures including a reduction in headcount through layoffs and attrition  mandated time off  limited hiring  salary and wage freezes  reduced discretionary spending  manufacturing process improvements  periodic plant shutdowns and lower raw material and supply costs 
engineering engineering expenses were million or of net sales in fiscal and million or of net sales in fiscal  respectively 
the increase in engineering expense in fiscal resulted primarily from increased headcount to support the increase in prototype work and additional field application engineers to support the sales organization 
greater levels of design assistance and engineering services in the early stages of product development are critical to engaging with new customers and supporting higher technology products manufactured 
increases in engineering expenses were partially offset by the absence of incentive bonuses and mandated time off in fiscal selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses were million or of net sales and million or of net sales in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expense resulted from tight controls on discretionary spending and mandated time off 
although salary expenses increased slightly due to strategic hires to strengthen the organization  headcount remained flat and bonuses decreased significantly in fiscal as compared to fiscal in addition  we reduced outside services and outside sales commissions and did not significantly increase our provision for bad debts and reserves for out of warranty costs in fiscal  as compared to fiscal 
table of contents interest income interest income decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due to the decline in our investment balances and the lower yield on those balances as a result of lower interest rates 
interest expense interest expense declined to  in fiscal from million in fiscal due partially to million in principal payments on long term debt made in fiscal in addition  we capitalized approximately  of interest costs related to capacity expansion projects in fiscal compared to  in fiscal capitalized interest is amortized over the lives of the buildings and equipment to which it relates 
other expense  net other expense  net  increased to  in fiscal  compared to  in fiscal  primarily due to one time costs associated with early retirement of debt recorded in fiscal income taxes our effective tax rate was a benefit of in fiscal compared to an expense of in fiscal excluding the benefit related to research and development tax credits from prior years recorded during fiscal  our effective tax rate would have been a benefit of for the year 
the effective rate reflected research and development tax credits related to fiscal the effective tax rate in fiscal reflected benefits from foreign sales exclusion and the resolution of irs tax issues 
liquidity and capital resources at the end of fiscal  we had million in cash and cash equivalents as well as million in short term investments compared to million in cash and cash equivalents and million in short term investments at the end of fiscal we used million cash in operating activities in fiscal as a result of the net loss for the year adjusted for depreciation and amortization  deferred income taxes including the valuation allowance  merix stock issued to the defined contribution plan  losses on impairment or disposals of fixed assets  and a net increase in operating assets and liabilities 
accounts receivable and inventories increased as a result of the higher levels of sales and production in fiscal cash flows from investing activities in fiscal were million 
cash from investments in corporate securities resulted from the maturity of these investments 
cash of million was used to purchase manufacturing equipment and facilities in connection with our capacity expansion program and on going operations 
we had capital commitments of approximately million as of may   primarily for manufacturing equipment at wood village 
cash flows from financing activities in fiscal were million  and were primarily from the issuance of a million  convertible debenture due may that we sold in the first quarter of fiscal the debenture is convertible into shares of our common stock at a fixed conversion price of  and is callable after august if certain conditions are met 
interest is payable quarterly 
we paid million in financing costs associated with the transaction and a portion of the proceeds were used to pay off million in outstanding senior unsecured notes 
in addition  we received proceeds from stock option exercises 
we lease manufacturing equipment under an operating lease 
the lease agreement includes certain financial covenants including minimum net worth  debt to capitalization and debt service coverage requirements 
as of 
table of contents may   we continue to be out of compliance with the covenant that specifies a minimum debt service coverage ratio 
this covenant has been waived by the lessor through the first quarter of fiscal the lease includes a buy out provision whereby we have the option to purchase the equipment at the end of the fourth year 
we have informed the lessor of our intention to exercise the buy out option and  accordingly  we will pay million in the second quarter of fiscal and  in the third quarter of fiscal for the purchase of the equipment 
outstanding minimum lease payments totaling  will be paid in monthly installments until the buy out 
we lease a  square foot manufacturing facility located in wood village  oregon under an operating lease 
monthly lease payments escalate at specific points over the minimum ten year term of the lease 
outstanding minimum lease payments at the end of fiscal totaled million 
payments on the initial term of the lease extend through july and we have the option to extend the initial term of the lease for three consecutive periods of five years each 
the following summarizes contractual obligations for merix at the end of fiscal and the effect of such on its liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands 
future minimum lease payments convertible debenture total years ending may  thereafter less amounts due within year total long term obligations fiscal includes  related to the early buy out of the equipment lease 
the company had capital commitments of approximately million as of may   primarily relating to the purchase of manufacturing equipment at wood village pursuant to the capacity expansion programs at both our wood village  oregon and forest grove  oregon locations that commenced in the first quarter of fiscal due to current industry conditions  the completion of this program has been suspended 
see risk factors affecting business and results of operations 
we believe that our existing capital resources and cash generated from operations should be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements through at least the next months 
risk factors affecting business and results of operations an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk 
you should carefully consider the factors described below  in addition to those discussed elsewhere in this report  in analyzing an investment in our common stock 
if any of the events described below occurs  our business  financial condition and results of operations would likely suffer  the trading price of our common stock could fall  and you could lose all or part of the money you paid for our common stock 
in addition  the following risk factors and uncertainties could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in our forward looking statements  whether made in this annual report on form k or the other documents we file with the sec  or in our annual or quarterly 
table of contents reports to shareholders  future press releases  or orally  whether in presentations  responses to questions or otherwise 
we are dependent upon the electronics industry  which has suffered a significant downturn in demand resulting in excess manufacturing capacity  increased price competition  and decreased demand for our products 
decreases in demand for our products and decreases in pricing may result in lower sales 
because many of our operating costs are fixed  lower sales may cause gross margins and operating results to decrease 
the electronics industry  on which our business depends  has historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic downturns characterized by diminished product demand  rapid declines in average selling prices and over capacity 
the electronics industry is currently experiencing a recession and is likely to experience recessionary periods in the future 
the economic conditions affecting the electronics industry  in general  or any of our major customers  in particular  has adversely affected our operating results and may continue to do so in the future 
the electronics industry is characterized by intense competition  rapid technological change  relatively short production life cycles and pricing and margin pressures 
when these factors adversely affect our customers  we suffer similar effects 
our customers are primarily high technology equipment manufacturers in the communications  high end computing and test and measurement end markets of the electronics industry 
due to the uncertainty in the end markets served by most of our customers  we cannot accurately predict our future financial results or accurately anticipate future orders 
at any time  our customers can discontinue or modify products containing components manufactured by us  adjust the timing of orders and shipments or impact our mix of revenues generated from quick turn versus standard lead time production  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature  and planned expenditures are based in part on anticipated orders 
accordingly  revenue shortfalls that result from decreased demand for our product have resulted in an under utilization of our installed capacity and together with adverse pricing have decreased our gross margins 
future decreases in demand or pricing may further decrease our gross margins 
results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for any future period 
competition in the market for electronic interconnect solutions is intense  and could reduce our sales and prevent us from achieving or maintaining profitability 
the market for electronic interconnect solutions is intensely competitive  highly fragmented and rapidly changing 
we expect competition to persist  which could result in continued reductions in pricing and gross margins and loss of market share 
we believe our major competitors are the large united states and international independent producers that manufacture multilayer printed circuit boards  provide backplanes and other electronic assemblies  and offer quick turn services  such as dynamic details inc  multek a division of flextronics international ltd  sanmina sci  ttm technologies inc and tyco international ltd 
new and emerging technologies may result in new competitors entering our market 
many of our competitors and potential competitors may have a number of significant advantages over us  including significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and manufacturing resources  preferred vendor status with our existing and potential customers  and larger customer bases 

table of contents in addition  these competitors may have the ability to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies  may adapt more quickly to changes in customer requirements and may devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than we can 
we must continually develop improved manufacturing processes to meet our customers needs for complex products  and our basic interconnect technology is generally not subject to significant proprietary protection 
we may not be able to maintain or expand our sales if competition increases and we are unable to respond effectively 
during recessionary periods in the electronics industry  our competitive advantages in the areas of providing an integrated manufacturing solution and responsive customer service may be less important to our customers than they are in a more favorable economic climate 
our customers have become very price sensitive 
price competition from printed circuit board manufacturers in asia and other locations with lower production costs may play an increasing role in the printed circuit board markets in which we compete 
while historically printed circuit board manufacturers in these locations have primarily competed only in markets for less technologically advanced products  they are expanding their technology to include relatively higher technology printed circuit boards than those historically manufactured 
these competitors may gain market share in the higher technology printed circuit board market  which may have a material adverse effect on the pricing of our products and our gross margin and may cause our sales to decrease 
because a small number of customers account for a substantial portion of our revenue  our revenue could significantly decline if we lose a major customer or if a major customer orders less of our products or cancels or delays orders 
historically  we have derived a significant portion of our revenue from a limited number of customers 
our top five oem customers represented  and of our net sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
we expect to continue to depend upon a small number of customers for a significant portion of our net sales for the foreseeable future 
the loss of or decrease in orders from one or more major customers could reduce our revenues and materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  many of our new customers are relatively small companies  and our future business with them may be significantly affected by their ability to continue to obtain financing 
if they are unable to obtain adequate financing  they will not be able to purchase products  which  in the aggregate  would materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
because we sell on a purchase order basis  we are subject to uncertainties and variability in demand by our customers  which could decrease revenues and negatively impact our operating results 
we sell to customers on a purchase order basis rather than pursuant to long term contracts  and  consequently  our net sales are subject to short term variability in demand by our customers 
customers submitting a purchase order may cancel  reduce or delay their order for a variety of reasons 
the level and timing of orders placed by our customers vary due to customer efforts to manage inventory  changes in customers manufacturing strategies  such as a decision by a customer to either diversify or consolidate the number of printed circuit board manufacturers used or to manufacture their own products internally  and fluctuation in demand for our customers products 
we have experienced terminations  reductions and delays in our customers orders 
further terminations  reductions or delays in our customers orders could decrease our revenues and negatively affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents we may be unable to successfully utilize production assets that are currently idled  which may negatively impact our operating results 
we have constructed a  square foot leased manufacturing facility located in wood village  oregon and have installed select manufacturing equipment at that location as part of a planned capacity expansion program 
the facility has been idle since construction and initial equipment testing was completed in january if demand for our product does not return to levels sufficient to justify the start up of the wood village facility we may either abandon it or impair its value  either of which would have a material adverse impact on our operating results 
if we start up the wood village facility  we may encounter significant start up risks including delays in receiving and installing required manufacturing equipment  labor shortages  and production start up problems that could prevent us from meeting our customer s delivery schedules 
in addition  we would incur new fixed operating expenses associated with the start up of wood village  including increased depreciation expenses 
if our revenues do not increase sufficiently to offset these expenses  our operating results may be harmed 
in addition  the electronics industry is cyclical and subject to significant economic downturns characterized by diminished product demand  rapid declines in average selling prices and over capacity 
unfavorable economic conditions affecting the electronics industry in general  or any of our major customers  may affect our ability to successfully utilize our additional manufacturing capacity in an effective manner  which could adversely affect our operating results 
we rely on suppliers for the timely delivery of raw materials used in manufacturing our printed circuit boards  and an increase in industry demand or the presence of a shortage for these raw materials may increase the price of these raw materials and reduce our gross margins 
to manufacture our printed circuit boards  we use raw materials such as laminated layers of fiberglass  copper foil and chemical solutions which we order from our suppliers 
although we have preferred suppliers for most of our raw materials  the materials we use are generally readily available in the open market  and numerous other potential suppliers exist 
however  from time to time manufacturers of products that also use these raw materials increase their demand for these materials and  as a result  the prices of these materials increase 
during these periods of increased demand  our gross margins may decrease as we have to pay more for our raw materials 
in addition  if a raw material supplier fails to meet our quality and other requirements  this could adversely affect our net sales and operating profit 
suppliers may from time to time extend lead times  limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors  which could adversely affect our ability to deliver our products on a timely basis 
we may be exposed to intellectual property infringement claims by third parties which could be costly to defend  could divert management s attention and resources and  if successful  could result in liability 
we could be subject to legal proceedings and claims for alleged infringement by us of third party proprietary rights  such as patents 
any claims relating to infringement  even if not meritorious  could result in costly litigation and divert management s attention and resources 
if we do not prevail in any litigation as a result of such allegations  our results of operations and financial condition could be affected 
products we manufacture may contain design or manufacturing defects  which could result in reduced demand for our services and liability claims against us 
we manufacture products to our customers specifications  which are highly complex and may contain design or manufacturing errors or failures despite our quality control and quality assurance efforts 
defects in the 
table of contents products we manufacture  whether caused by a design  manufacturing or materials failure or error  may result in delayed shipments  customer dissatisfaction  or a reduction or cancellation of purchase orders 
if these defects occur either in large quantities or too frequently  our business reputation may be impaired 
since our products are used in products that are integral to our customers businesses  errors  defects or other performance problems could result in financial or other damages to our customers beyond the cost of the printed circuit board  for which we may be liable 
although our invoices and sales arrangements generally contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to product liability and related claims  existing or future laws or unfavorable judicial decisions could negate these limitation of liability provisions 
product liability litigation against us  even if it were unsuccessful  would be time consuming and costly to defend 
although we maintain a warranty reserve  we cannot assure you that this reserve will be sufficient to cover our warranty or other expenses that could arise as a result of defects found in our products 
acquisitions may be costly and difficult to integrate  may divert management resources and may dilute shareholder value 
as part of our business strategy  we may make acquisitions of  or investments in  companies  products or technologies that complement our current products  augment our market coverage  enhance our technical capabilities or production capacity or that may otherwise offer growth opportunities 
in connection with these acquisitions or investments  we could issue stock that would dilute our current shareholders percentage ownership  incur debt and assume liabilities that could impair our liquidity  and incur amortization expenses related to intangible assets  or incur large and immediate write offs that would reduce net income 
future acquisitions also could pose numerous additional risks to our operations  including problems integrating the purchased operations  technologies or products  unanticipated costs  diversion of management s attention from our core business  adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers  entering markets in which we have limited or no prior experience  and potential loss of key employees  particularly those of the purchased organization 
we may not be able to complete one or more acquisitions or integrate the operations  products or personnel gained through any such acquisition without a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our manufacturing process depends on the collective experience of our manufacturing employees in our industry 
if these employees were to leave us and take this knowledge with them  our manufacturing process may suffer and we may not be able to compete effectively 
we have limited patent or trade secret protection for our manufacturing process  but instead rely on the collective experience of our employees in the manufacturing process to ensure we continuously evaluate and adopt new technologies in our industry 
although we are not dependent on any one employee or a small number of employees  if a significant number of our employees involved in our manufacturing process were to leave our employment and we were not able to replace these people with new employees with comparable experience  our manufacturing process may suffer as we may be unable to keep up with innovations in the industry 
as a result  we may not be able to continue to compete effectively  which would have a negative effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents if we lose key management  engineering  sales and marketing and professional services personnel  we could experience reduced sales  delayed product development and diversion of management resources 
our success depends largely on the continued contributions of our key management  engineering  sales and marketing and professional services personnel  many of whom would be difficult to replace 
we do not have employment or non compete agreements with our key personnel 
if one or more members of our senior management were to resign  the loss of personnel could result in loss of sales  delays in new product development and diversion of management resources  which would have a negative effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we do not maintain key man insurance policies on any of our personnel 
the market price of our common stock has been depressed  and may decline further 
based on the various factors that cause fluctuations in our stock  we expect the trading price of our common stock to remain highly volatile 
the trading price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly and generally declined  from an all time high of per share on september  to a low for fiscal of per share on march  the market price of our common stock may decline further as a result of a number of factors 
factors that could continue to cause fluctuations in the market price of our common stock include actual and anticipated variations in our operating results  general economic and market conditions  interest rates  geopolitical conditions throughout the world  general conditions  including changes in demand in the printed circuit board industry and the end markets which it serves  perceptions of the strengths and weaknesses of the printed circuit board industry and the end markets which it serves  our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt when due  developments in our relationships with our lenders  customers  and or suppliers  announcements of alliances  mergers or other relationships by or between our competitors and or our suppliers and customers  announcements of plant closings  layoffs  restructurings or bankruptcies by our competitors  and developments related to regulations  including environmental and wastewater regulations 
we expect this volatility to continue in the future 
in addition  any shortfall or changes in our revenue  gross margins  earnings or other financial results could also cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly 
in recent years the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the printed circuit board industry and that may be unrelated to the operating performance of the companies within these industries 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and limit our ability to raise capital or finance transactions using equity instruments 
we are exposed to the credit risk of some of our customers and to credit exposures in weakened markets and foreign countries 
most of our sales are on an open credit basis  with standard industry payment terms 
we monitor individual customer payment capability in granting such open credit arrangements  seek to limit such open credit to amounts we believe the customers can pay  and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure 
table of contents for doubtful accounts 
because of the current slowdown in the global economy and the electronics industry  our exposure to credit risks from our customers has increased 
although we have programs in place to monitor and mitigate the associated risk those programs may not be effective in reducing our credit risks 
there have been bankruptcies among our customers causing us to incur financial losses 
if economic conditions do not improve  additional losses may be incurred and may be material 
we also have sales on open credit to customers located in foreign countries and collection of amounts due to us from these customers is subject to risks from potential changes in the global geopolitical environment 
although losses have not been material to date  future losses  if incurred  could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
we are subject to a variety of environmental laws 
we are required to comply with all federal  state  county and municipal regulations regarding protection of the environment 
electronic interconnect product manufacturing requires the use of a variety of materials  including metals and chemicals 
water used in the printed circuit board manufacturing process must be treated to remove metal particles and other contaminants before it can be discharged into the municipal sanitary sewer system 
as a result  we are subject to various federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws and regulations  including those governing the storage  use  discharge and disposal of hazardous substances in the ordinary course of our manufacturing processes 
although we believe our current manufacturing operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations  environmental legislation has been enacted and may in the future be enacted or interpreted to create environmental liability with respect to our facilities or operations 
we may be responsible for the cleanup of any contamination discovered at our current and former manufacturing facilities and could be subject to revocation of permits necessary to conduct our business 
further  we cannot guaranty that additional environmental matters will not arise in the future at sites where no problem is currently known or at sites that we may acquire in the future 
if we are responsible for cleanup  subjected to onerous additional regulation or fail to obtain or maintain required permits  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be negatively affected 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest income we can earn on our funds available for investment 
we ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in high credit quality securities 
we do not believe that changes in interest rates will have a material effect on our liquidity  financial condition or results of operations 
we do not have interest rate risk in our long term debt and do not enter into interest rate swap agreements 
a change in interest rates would not affect interest expense on the million  convertible debenture because that instrument bears a fixed rate of interest
