our macromedia shockwave player is a rich media player used for deploying multimedia content for use in internet solutions  and is also distributed by downloading it from our websites at no charge 
throughout fiscal year  our business continued to be negatively impacted by the worldwide economic conditions  including the continued weakness in information technology it and web developer spending 
accordingly  we have maintained our focus on controlling costs and realizing the cost reduction benefits from our fiscal year restructuring efforts 
at the same time  we continue to invest in our research and development activities to enhance existing products and create new products to address new markets and customers 
throughout fiscal years and  we operated in one business segment  the software segment 
prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal year  our operations included a business segment consisting of our then consolidated subsidiary  atomshockwave corporation atomshockwave  formerly shockwave 
com  a provider of on line entertainment on the web 
on january   shockwave 
com consummated its merger with atom corporation  with the surviving company named atomshockwave 
as a result of the transaction  we no longer consolidate the results of atomshockwave and currently operate in one business segment  the software segment 
we evaluate operating segment performance based on net revenues and total operating expenses of the software segment 
at march   we held approximately of the outstanding voting shares of atomshockwave 
this investment is accounted for under the equity method 
critical accounting policies we make certain estimates  assumptions and judgments when preparing our consolidated financial statements 
these estimates  assumptions and judgments can have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements including the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets as well as the amounts of net revenues  operating income loss and net income loss on our consolidated statements of operations 
we have identified the following to be critical accounting policies to macromedia allowance for sales returns  allowance for doubtful accounts  restructuring expenses and related accruals  goodwill and other intangible assets  and income taxes 
allowance for sales returns 
the primary sales channels through which we sell our boxed and volume licensed products throughout the world are a network of distributors and vars 
agreements for boxed products with our distributors and vars contain specific product return privileges for stock rotation and obsolete products that are generally limited to contractual amounts 
current product returns for stock rotation from distributors are generally limited to of their prior quarter s purchases  provided they order new products for an amount equal to or exceeding the amount of the requested return 
distributors may typically return of their inventory balance of obsolete products within a limited time after the release of a new version of such software 
under the terms of our distribution agreements  authorized returns of obsolete products require a new order from such distributor at an amount not less than the amount of the requested return 
sales of our volume licensed products generally do not contain return privileges except for order errors that are identified by the customer within a limited period of time 
products purchased directly from us by end users  including sales from our on line stores have day return rights 
as part of our revenue recognition practices  we have established an allowance for sales returns based upon estimated and known returns 
product returns are recorded as a reduction of net revenues and as a reduction of our accounts receivable balance 
we review our allowance for sales returns on an ongoing basis 
at march   our sales returns reserve totaled million and included million of requested and authorized returns by our distributors primarily related to our studio mx product following the march introduction of its successor version  studio mx plus 
in estimating our allowance for sales returns  we evaluate the following factors historical product returns and inventory levels on a product by product basis  for each of our primary sales regions  
table of contents 
index to financial statements current inventory levels and sell through data on a product by product basis as reported to us by our distributors worldwide on a weekly or monthly basis  our demand forecast by product in each of our principal geographic markets  which is impacted by our product release schedule  seasonal trends  analyses developed by our internal sales and marketing organizations and analysis of third party market data  general economic conditions  specifically in the markets we serve  and trends in our accounts receivable 
in fiscal years  and  product returns  consisting principally of stock rotation for obsolete products  totaled million  million and million  or  and of net revenues  respectively 
our product returns in fiscal year were impacted by transition and upgrade cycles associated with the launch of our mx product family 
similarly  fiscal year product returns were impacted by new product offerings 
in general  we would expect the allowance for sales returns to increase following the announcement of new or upgraded versions of our products or in anticipation of such product announcements  as our distributors and vars seek to reduce their inventory levels of the prior version of a product in advance of receiving the new version 
similarly  we would expect that product inventory held by our distributors and vars would increase following the successful introduction of new or upgraded products  as these resellers stock the new version in anticipation of end user demand  which would result in a lower allowance for sales returns 
in assessing the appropriateness of product inventory levels held by our resellers and the impact on potential product returns  we may limit sales to our distributors and vars in order to maintain inventory levels deemed by management to be appropriate 
we generally estimate our allowance for sales returns based on channel inventory levels between four to six weeks of expected sales by our first tier distributors and vars  based on the criteria noted above 
we make these estimates based on channel inventory and sell through information that we obtain principally from our first tier distributors and vars 
product returns from our first tier distributors and vars are also impacted by actual product returns they receive directly from lower tiers of distribution for which we receive limited inventory and sell through information 
accordingly  actual product returns in future periods may differ from our estimates and may have a material adverse effect on our net revenues and consolidated results of operations due to factors including  but not limited to  market conditions and product release cycles 
at march   our channel inventory  net of related reserves  remained within the estimated channel inventory range noted above 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding accounts receivable and provide an allowance for the portion of our accounts receivable when collection becomes doubtful 
we initially record our allowance for doubtful accounts based on our historical experience and then adjust this allowance at the end of each reporting period based on an assessment of our accounts receivable and related allowance 
we also make judgments about the creditworthiness of customers based on ongoing credit evaluations and the aging profile of customer accounts receivable  and assess current economic trends that might impact the level of credit losses in the future 
historically  our allowance for doubtful accounts has been sufficient to cover our actual credit losses 
however  since we cannot predict changes in the financial stability of our customers  we cannot guarantee that our allowance will continue to be sufficient 
if actual credit losses are significantly greater than the allowance that we have established  this would increase our operating expenses and reduce our reported net income 
our allowance for doubtful accounts amounted to million  or of gross accounts receivable  at march  and million  or of total gross accounts receivable  at march  the lower balance of the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of gross accounts receivable at march  as compared to march  was based on improvements in certain accounts receivable metrics 
distributors account for a significant portion of our net revenues and accounts receivable and comprise several individually large accounts  one of which represented of our consolidated net revenues in fiscal 
table of contents 
index to financial statements years   and  and and of our gross accounts receivable at march  and  respectively 
if the credit exposure associated with a large distributor relationship deteriorated  affecting its ability to make payments  an additional provision for doubtful accounts may be required 
historically  we have not experienced significant losses related to any particular industry or geographic region 
restructuring expenses and related accruals 
in fiscal year  we executed a restructuring plan to deliver cost synergies associated with our fiscal year acquisition of allaire corporation allaire and to better align our cost structure with the weaker business environment 
the million charge recorded as a result of the restructuring primarily related to facility exit costs to cancel or vacate approximately  square feet of facility space held under our operating leases and  to a lesser extent  employee termination and severance costs 
our restructuring expenses and accruals involved significant estimates made by management using the best information available at the time that the estimates were made  some of which we have obtained and verified through third party advisors 
these estimates include facility exit costs such as demise and lease termination costs  timing and market conditions of rental payments and estimated sublease income  and any fees associated with our restructuring expenses  such as brokerage fees 
on a regular basis we evaluate a number of factors to determine the appropriateness and reasonableness of our restructuring accruals 
such factors include  but are not limited to  market data in order to estimate the likelihood  timing  term and lease rates to be realized from potential subleases of restructured facilities held under operating leases 
we also estimate costs associated with terminating certain leases on excess facilities 
these estimates involve a number of risks and uncertainties  some of which may be beyond our control and include future real estate conditions and our ability to market and sublease excess facilities on terms acceptable to us  particularly in newton  massachusetts  northern california  bracknell  united kingdom  and to a lesser extent in richardson  texas and minneapolis  minnesota 
in addition  our restructuring estimates for facilities could be adversely impacted by the financial condition of sub lessees and their ability to meet the financial obligations throughout the term of any sublease agreement  and estimated costs associated with canceling or vacating such facility leases 
at march   we estimated future sublease income of million in connection with restructured facilities held under operating leases 
the impact of these estimated proceeds and costs are significant factors in determining the appropriateness of our restructuring accrual balance on our consolidated balance sheet at march  actual results may differ significantly from our estimates and as such  may require adjustments to our restructuring accrual which will impact our operating results in future periods 
the commercial real estate markets where we have significant operating lease obligations may continue to experience weakening demand and excess capacity  notably the newton  massachusetts commercial real estate market 
at march   our future minimum lease obligation for the portion of the newton lease related to space that is currently subleased or available for sublease  net of sublease income to be received from existing subtenants  was million 
the newton lease represented of our total accrued restructuring at march  our newton space covers  square feet held under operating leases through  of which we currently occupy  square feet  sublease  square feet to existing subtenants  and have  square feet available for sublease 
of the  square feet that we currently sublease to existing tenants or have available for sublease  subleases covering  square feet will expire prior to our lease termination in should the newton  massachusetts commercial real estate markets deteriorate further  we may not be able to find acceptable tenants at the rates or timing consistent with what we used in estimating our restructuring accrual 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
in fiscal year  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
as a result of adopting this standard  we no longer amortize goodwill  which had a net book value of million and million at march  and  respectively  including million in assembled workforce at march   that was reclassified to goodwill upon adoption of the standard 
however  under sfas no 
we will continue to amortize our other 
table of contents 
index to financial statements intangible assets with estimated useful lives 
we currently operate in one business segment  the software segment 
when reviewing goodwill for impairment  sfas no 
requires us to assess whether goodwill should be allocated to operating levels lower than our software segment termed reporting units for which discrete financial information is available and reviewed for decision making purposes 
in addition  the reporting unit would have economic characteristics different than the economic characteristics of the other components of the software segment 
currently  we do not have any reporting units lower than our software segment that meet the criteria set forth in sfas no 
sfas no 
also required us to perform a transitional impairment test by assessing the fair value and recoverability of our goodwill upon adoption and at least once a year prospectively 
we performed a transitional impairment test upon adoption of this standard  which did not result in an impairment of our goodwill 
in fiscal year  we compared the unamortized capitalized cost of the developed technology associated with our fiscal year acquisition of allaire to the product s net realizable value 
this analysis was performed by an independent valuation firm under the guidance of sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
as a result of this analysis  we recorded an impairment charge of million for the developed technology asset 
this charge represented the amount by which the carrying value of the developed technology asset exceeded its estimated net realizable value 
as a result of the impairment of our developed technology asset  we also performed an impairment analysis on the trade name associated with our fiscal year acquisition of allaire 
this analysis was performed by an independent valuation firm under the guidance of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  initially comparing the estimated undiscounted cash flows of the trade name to its carrying value 
as a result of this analysis  we recorded an impairment charge of million for the trade name asset 
this charge represented the amount by which the carrying value exceeded its fair value  estimated by calculating its discounted cash flows 
as a result of the impairment of the developed technology asset and trade name  we also performed an impairment analysis on our goodwill and assessed the fair value and recoverability of the goodwill balance as of september  this analysis did not result in an impairment of our goodwill 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we performed an annual impairment analysis to assess the fair value and recoverability of our goodwill in the fourth quarter of fiscal year this analysis did not result in an impairment charge to our goodwill 
we intend to continue to perform this analysis in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year  unless facts and circumstances warrant a review of goodwill for impairment before that time  as stipulated by sfas no 
changes in market conditions and other business indicators could give rise to factors that would require us to assess whether any of our intangible assets are impaired 
significant changes in demand for our products or changes in market conditions in the principal markets in which we sell our products  could adversely impact the carrying value of these assets 
in particular  if there is a significant and other than temporary decline in the market value of our common stock  a decrease in the market value of a particular asset  or operating or cash flow losses combined with forecasted future losses  we could be required to record impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets  which could adversely affect our financial results 
in addition  should we develop and manage our business using discrete financial information for reporting units in the future  we may be required to allocate our goodwill balance to those reporting units  which may result in an impairment of part or all of our recorded goodwill 
income taxes 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process also involves estimating the impact of additional taxes resulting from tax examinations  primarily in foreign jurisdictions 
these examinations  which primarily relate to our cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities  are often complex and can require several years to resolve 
accruals for tax contingencies require management to estimate the actual outcome of the audit 
actual results could vary from these estimates 

table of contents 
index to financial statements our provision for or benefit from income taxes is also dependent upon our estimation of a deferred tax asset valuation allowance and the change in our net deferred tax asset balance at each balance sheet date 
significant judgment is used to determine the likelihood that we will realize our deferred tax assets in the future  and includes our ability to forecast future taxable income 
an increase in the valuation allowance could have a material adverse impact on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made

software segment atomshockwave net revenues for the software segment were million in fiscal year  as compared to million in fiscal year the increase was primarily due to the successful launch of our new products and new versions of existing products 
however  we believe our net revenues in fiscal year were adversely impacted by the continued weakness in it and web developer spending 
our software tools products had net revenues of million in fiscal year  as compared to million in fiscal year this increase was primarily due to the launch of new software tools products and new versions of existing software tools products  including our mx family of products and macromedia contribute 
macromedia studio mx  which was launched in the first quarter of fiscal year  represented approximately of our net revenues in the current fiscal year 
while sales of macromedia studio mx did result in a decrease in sales of our stand alone products that are included in our studio mx bundle  aggregate sales from all of our mx products increased by in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year this increase was partially offset by a decline in net revenues from our server software products  primarily macromedia coldfusion mx 
server software product revenues decreased to million in fiscal year  as compared to million in fiscal year this decrease was primarily due to continued pricing pressures resulting from a very competitive market environment  partially offset by releases of new versions of existing products during the current fiscal year 
net revenues for the software segment were million in fiscal year  as compared to million in fiscal year the weakness in it and web developer spending experienced worldwide during fiscal year  combined with fewer new product releases as compared to the prior fiscal year  were the primary factors contributing to the decline in our revenues during fiscal year our software tools products had fiscal year net revenues of million  as compared to million in fiscal year  resulting from the overall market decline and relatively mature product cycles of our 
table of contents

the decline in revenues during fiscal year from our software tools products was partially offset by a full year of revenues from our server software products primarily macromedia coldfusion and macromedia jrun server obtained from our acquisition of allaire in march server software product revenues were million in fiscal year  as compared to million in fiscal year  resulting from the timing of the allaire acquisition which contributed only days of revenues in fiscal year  as compared to a full year in fiscal year as a result of our deconsolidation of atomshockwave during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  our consolidated net revenues during fiscal years and no longer reflected revenues from atomshockwave 
net revenues for the atomshockwave segment were million in fiscal year during the period that atomshockwave was consolidated 
throughout fiscal year  we released a number of new and upgraded products and intend to continue introducing new and upgraded products in the foreseeable future 
delays in the introduction of planned future product releases  or failure to achieve significant customer acceptance for these new products  may have a material adverse effect on our net revenues and consolidated results of operations in future periods

costs of revenues for the software segment was million or of net revenues in fiscal year  as compared to million or of net revenues in fiscal year cost of revenues for our software segment decreased in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year due to decreases in cost of materials  training costs and royalties paid to third parties for the licensing of developed technology of million  million and million  respectively 
in addition  during fiscal year  we had a greater percentage of revenues from volume license sales  which have a higher gross margin than our traditional box product sales 
these savings were partially offset by an increase in inventory charges for obsolescence of million in fiscal year as compared to the prior fiscal year due to the launch of the mx product family 
cost of revenues for the software segment was million or of net revenues in fiscal year  as compared to million or of net revenues in fiscal year cost of revenues for the software segment increased in absolute dollars during fiscal year due to higher customer training costs primarily for our server software products and partner training programs 
in addition  during fiscal year  we incurred higher royalties for third party technologies  particularly those embedded in product lines acquired in the allaire acquisition 
the year over year increase as a percentage of software net revenues was due to a lower revenue base over which to spread our fixed costs  which primarily consist of royalties paid to third parties for the licensing of developed technology  and costs to translate our software into various foreign languages 
these increases were partially offset by decreased consulting costs due to a re allocation of personnel from providing consulting services during fiscal year to focusing on product sales and marketing efforts during fiscal year cost of revenues for the atomshockwave segment was million in fiscal year during the period it was consolidated 
cost of revenues for atomshockwave included revenue sharing paid to content developers and commission expenses for the sale of web advertising space 
in the future  cost of revenues as a percentage of net revenues may be impacted by the mix of product sales  royalty rates for licensed technology and the geographic distribution of sales

on april  and the impairment of certain intangible assets during fiscal year amortization of intangible assets was million in fiscal year as compared to million in fiscal year the increase was primarily due to the amortization of intangible assets resulting from the allaire acquisition during fiscal year the following table summarizes our estimated future annual amortization charges from our intangible assets at march  amortization expense in thousands fiscal year acquisition related expenses and in process research and development

in fiscal year  we recorded million of acquisition related expenses and in process research and development  related to our acquisitions of allaire and middlesoft  inc middlesoft 
these acquired technologies were recognized as in process research and development as they had not reached technological feasibility at the time of the transactions and had not alternative future uses 
in fiscal year  we also recorded million of acquisition related expenses in connection with our acquisition of bitcraft  inc  which was accounted for as a pooling of interest business combination 
these acquisition related expenses included investment banker fees  legal and other professional fees  severance and personnel relocation costs 
non cash stock compensation

we had completely amortized our deferred stock compensation balances as of march  in fiscal year  substantially all of our deferred stock compensation was attributable to atomshockwave  which we deconsolidated from our consolidated results in january amortization of non cash stock compensation was allocated to the following expense functions in our consolidated statements of operations in thousands cost of revenues sales and marketing research and development general and administrative we did not allocate any non cash stock compensation to other expense functions in fiscal year restructuring expenses 
in fiscal year  we executed a restructuring plan to deliver cost synergies associated with our fiscal year acquisition of allaire and to better align our cost structure with the weaker business environment 
the million charge recorded as a result of the restructuring primarily related to exit costs to cancel or vacate approximately  square feet of facility space held under our operating leases and to employee termination and severance costs 
our restructuring expenses and accruals involves significant estimates made by management using the best information available at the time that the estimates were made  some of which we have obtained and verified through third party advisors 
we continually review our restructuring accrual to determine its appropriateness and reasonableness 
the commercial real estate markets where we have significant operating lease obligations may continue to experience weakening demand and excess capacity  notably the newton  massachusetts commercial real estate market 
our newton lease covers  square feet through  of which we currently occupy  square feet  sublease  square feet to existing subtenants  and have  square feet available for sublease 
of the  square feet that we currently sublease to existing tenants or have available for sublease  subleases covering  square feet will expire prior to our lease termination in should the newton  massachusetts commercial real estate markets deteriorate further  we may not be able to find acceptable tenants at the rates or the timing that we used in estimating our restructuring accrual 
other income expense interest income and other  net 
interest income and other  net  was million in fiscal year  as compared to million in fiscal year returns from interest bearing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and remeasurements represent the majority of the activity for fiscal years  and the decline in our interest income and other  net in fiscal year is primarily due to lower yields on our cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances as compared to the prior fiscal year  partially offset by higher average balances of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments in the current fiscal year 
in fiscal year  our interest income and other  net was million  as compared to million in fiscal year the decline was due to lower average balances of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and lower yields in fiscal year  as compared to fiscal year we also recorded losses on

in fiscal year  we reimbursed million to one of the insurers of a securities litigation against us and certain of our former officers and directors  which was settled in fiscal year in fiscal year  we also recorded a litigation settlement charge of million related to an executed memorandum of understanding mou in connection with pending securities litigation against us and certain of allaire s officers and directors 
the executed mou sets forth the basic terms of a settlement whereby the plaintiffs agree to dismiss the pending securities litigation and provide a broad release of all claims arising out of their purchase  sale or holding of allaire stock in exchange for a payment of million  million of which would be paid by insurers and million would by paid by us 
the parties settlement is expressly contingent on court approval  which may be withheld or  if provided  may be subject to an appeal to  or reversal by  an appellate court 
in fiscal year  we signed a stipulation of settlement with lead plaintiffs that resolved securities litigation pending against us and certain of our former officers and directors since the settlement amount was million  of which million was initially recovered from insurance  net of reimbursable legal fees 
as a result  we recorded a million charge as a component of other income expense in our consolidated statements of operations during fiscal year of the million of insurance coverage  million was subsequently paid by us to rli corporation as a result of the rli settlement in fiscal year in fiscal year  we also recorded a charge of million  relating to the settlement of outstanding patent claims between adobe and macromedia which was reversed in fiscal year as noted above 
gain on sale of acquired technology 
in fiscal year  we recorded a gain on the sale of acquired technology of million 
the net carrying value of the technology  which was previously acquired in connection with our acquisition of andromedia  inc during fiscal year  had already been fully amortized on our consolidated balance sheet as of the date of sale 
this gain represented the amount by which the proceeds received exceeded the net carrying value of this asset 
this gain was reported as a component of other income expense on our consolidated statements of operations  as the transaction that resulted in the gain was not considered a component of our normal and on going core business activities 
loss on investments  net 
we have historically held certain non marketable investments in certain companies that are accounted for on a cost basis 
impairment losses are recognized on these investments when we determine that there has been a decline in the fair market value of the investment that is other than temporary 
in fiscal year  we received  in cash from two of our non marketable cost basis investments  which were previously written off in accordance with our accounting policy 
the cash received was recorded as gains on investments 
these gains were partially offset by impairment losses of  recorded in fiscal year we also received approximately  shares of series b common stock in another company  resulting from a merger of one of these investees with a third party 
our management has determined the estimated fair value of the newly acquired shares to be insignificant 
accordingly  no cost basis for this non marketable investment was recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of march  at march  and  we also held common stock in two public companies that are accounted for as available for sale investments 
in fiscal year  we wrote off one of these investments  which resulted in a charge of  the write off resulted from the severe and continued decline in the investee s common stock price  which was viewed as other than temporary 
at march   the net carrying value of our other available for sale investment was

these losses represented write offs or write downs of the carrying amount of these investments and were determined considering  among other factors  the investees current and projected operating results  including estimated liquidation value and the inability of the investees to obtain additional financing 
during fiscal year  we received cash proceeds totaling  representing our portion of the liquidated assets of two investees whose investment balances were previously written off during fiscal year in accordance with our accounting policy 
in fiscal year  we recognized million in impairment losses on various strategic investments held at cost 
these losses were recorded in accordance with our accounting policy 
loss on equity affiliate 
we recorded losses from our equity affiliate  atomshockwave  of million in fiscal year the charge reflected our share of atomshockwave s losses recorded in the period  as well as the write down of our investment and the write off of certain receivables in the prior fiscal year 
our investment balance in atomshockwave since september  has been zero 
accordingly  we have not recognized our share of atomshockwave s losses since september   although we held approximately of the outstanding voting shares of atomshockwave at march provision for income taxes 
we recorded income tax provisions of million  million  and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
current taxes are primarily due to taxable income in certain foreign jurisdictions where we operate 
deferred taxes are primarily due to a change in deferred tax assets  which are related to domestic temporary differences 
a deferred tax asset valuation allowance has been established and is determined by assessing whether it is more likely than not the company will realize its deferred tax assets in the future 
at march   we had available federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of million and million  respectively

in fiscal year  we made capital expenditures of million 
in fiscal year  we anticipate spending million to million on capital expenditures  primarily relating to the purchase and implementation of new software applications  including a new integrated enterprise resource planning system and computer hardware 
we expect that our operating expenses will constitute a significant use of our cash balances  but that our cash from operations and existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for the foreseeable future 
cash from operations could be affected by various risks and uncertainties  including  without limitation  those related to the economic conditions in the domestic and international markets where we market and sell our products  customer acceptance of new products and services and new versions of existing products  the risk associated with changing our prices or business model  the risk of delay in product development and release dates  our dependence on our distributors  risks of product returns  quarterly fluctuations of operating results  risks associated with investments in international sales operations  the risk of integrating newly acquired technologies and products  the impact of competition  and the other risks detailed in the section risk factors that may affect future results of operations 
at times  we may require additional liquid capital resources and may seek to raise these additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings 
there can be no assurance that this additional financing will be available  or if available  will be on reasonable terms and not dilutive to our stockholders 
if additional funds are required at a future date and are not available on acceptable terms  our business and operating results could be adversely affected

index to financial statements intellectual property indemnification obligations the terms of our distribution agreements with our first tier distributors  including oems  generally provide for a limited indemnification of such distributors against losses  expenses and liabilities arising from third party claims based on alleged infringement by our products of an intellectual property right of such third party 
the terms of such indemnification often limit the scope of  and remedies for  such indemnification obligations and generally include a right to replace an infringing product 
to date  we have not had to reimburse any of our distributors for any losses related to these indemnification provisions pertaining to third party intellectual property infringement claims 
for several reasons  including the lack of prior indemnification claims and the lack of a monetary liability limit for certain infringement cases under the terms of the corresponding agreements with our distributors  we cannot determine the maximum amount of potential future payments  if any  related to such indemnification provisions

risk factors that may affect future results of operations except for the historical information contained in this annual report  the matters discussed herein are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  including those detailed below and from time to time in our other reports filed with the sec 
the actual results that we achieve may differ significantly from any forward looking statements due to such risks and uncertainties 
our new product and version releases may not be successful a substantial portion of our revenues is derived from license sales of new software products and new versions of existing software products 
the success of new products and new versions of existing products  including our mx family of products  depends on the timing  market acceptance and performance of new products or new versions of existing products 
in the past we have experienced delays in the development of new products and enhancement of existing products and such delays may occur in the future 
if we are unable  due to resource constraints or technological reasons  to develop and introduce products in a timely manner  such inability could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations  including  in particular  our quarterly results 
in addition  market acceptance of our new product or version releases will be dependent on our ability to include functionalities and usability in such releases that address the requirements of customer demographics with which we may have limited prior experience 
we must update our existing products and services to keep them current with changing technology  competitive offerings and consumer preferences and must develop new products and services to take advantage of new technologies that could otherwise render our existing products  or existing versions of such products  obsolete 
furthermore  our new product or version releases may contain undetected errors or bugs  which may result in product failures or security breaches or otherwise fail to perform in accordance with customer expectations 
in addition  such releases may not properly guard against harmful or disruptive codes  including virus codes  which may target files or programs created using our products 
the occurrence of errors or harmful codes could result in loss of market share  diversion of development resources  injury to our reputation and the reputation of our products  or damage to our efforts to build positive brand awareness  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
if we do not ship new products or new versions of our existing products as planned  if new product or version releases do not achieve adequate market acceptance  or if new products or version releases fail to perform properly  our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
our future operating results are difficult to predict and our future operating results and our stock price are subject to volatility as a result of a variety of factors discussed herein  operating results for a particular period are extremely difficult to predict 
our revenues may grow at a slower rate than experienced in previous periods and  in particular periods  may decline 
our efforts to reduce our expenses may hinder our ability to achieve growth in our business and revenues 
any shortfall in revenues or results of operations from levels expected by securities analysts  general decline in economic conditions  or significant reductions in spending by our customers  could have an immediate and materially adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock in any given period 
in addition to factors specific to us  changes in analysts earnings estimates for us or our industry and factors affecting the corporate environment  our industry  or the securities markets in general will often result in significant volatility of our common stock price 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we face intense competition the markets for all of our product lines are highly competitive 
a number of companies currently offer products and services that compete directly or indirectly with one or more of our products 
our development tools compete directly and indirectly with products from major vendors including microsoft  corel and adobe 
our server products compete in a highly competitive and rapidly changing market for application server technologies 
with respect to our server products  we compete directly with products offered by microsoft  ibm  bea  sun and various open source or free technologies 
introduction of new products or functionalities in current products by us or by another company may intensify our current competitive pressures 
in addition  several of our current and potential competitors have greater financial  marketing  technical and intellectual property resources than we do 
furthermore  we have a number of strategic alliances with large and complex organizations  some of which may compete with us in certain markets 
these arrangements are generally limited to specific projects  the goal of which is generally to facilitate product compatibility 
if successful  these relationships may be mutually beneficial 
however  these alliances carry an element of risk because  in most cases  we must compete in some business areas with a company with which we have a strategic alliance and  at the same time  cooperate with that company in other business areas 
also  if these companies fail to perform or if these relationships fail to materialize as expected  we could suffer delays in product development or fail to realize the anticipated economic benefit 
risks associated with international operations international revenues accounted for approximately of our consolidated net revenues in each of fiscal years  and we expect that international sales will continue to represent a significant percentage of our revenues 
we rely primarily on third parties  including distributors  for sales and support of our software products in foreign countries and  accordingly  are dependent on their ability to promote and support our software products and in some cases  to translate them into foreign languages 
in addition  we have and may continue to  outsource specific development and quality assurance testing activities for certain of our software products to various foreign  independent third party contractors 
international business and operations are subject to a number of special risks  including foreign government regulation  reduced intellectual property protections  general geopolitical risks such as political and economic instability  hostilities with neighboring countries and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships  more prevalent software piracy  unexpected changes in  or imposition of  regulatory requirements  tariffs  import and export restrictions and other barriers and restrictions  longer payment cycles  greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivables  potentially adverse tax consequences  the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws  foreign currency risk  and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations 
additionally  we are uncertain whether the recent weaknesses experienced in foreign economies will continue in the foreseeable future due to  among other things  possible currency devaluation  liquidity problems and political and military hostilities in these regions 
we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce economic exposure associated with sales and asset balances denominated in the euro  japanese yen and british pound 
at march   the net notional 
table of contents 
index to financial statements amount of forward contracts outstanding amounted to million  primarily related to the euro  japanese yen and british pound 
however  there can be no assurance that such contracts will adequately manage our exposure to currency fluctuations in the long term  as the average maturity of these foreign exchange forward contracts is less than twelve months 
general economic conditions in recent periods  our operating results have been adversely affected by the general economic slowdown as well as reduced it and web developer spending worldwide 
the cost cutting initiatives implemented by some of the users of our products and services may reduce or stagnate the demand for our products  including our new product or version releases  until the economic conditions significantly improve 
in addition  any future general developments that may cause instability in the economy  including  but not limited to  material military engagements  war and increases in fuel prices  may prolong cost cutting initiatives and deter material increases in spending from our customers 
in addition  a substantial portion of our business and revenues depend on the continued growth and adoption of the internet and on the utilization of our products by customers that depend on the internet 
to the extent the economic slowdown and reduction in capital spending continue to adversely affect spending  we could continue to experience material adverse effects on our business  operating results and financial condition 
changing our pricing and business model could adversely affect our business we periodically make changes to our product pricing or offer alternative methods of licensing our product  based on market conditions  customer demands  or in connection with marketing activities 
for example  we recently increased the unit price of macromedia studio mx by approximately following the expiration of the introductory price period 
such increases in the pricing of our products may cause our customers to seek lower priced alternatives  decrease the aggregate demand for such products and have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
in addition  competition in our various markets may require us to reduce prices on certain products in such markets 
in the event that we are required to reduce the pricing of our products  we may not be able to offset the lower unit price with increased demand for the corresponding products 
furthermore  any changes in pricing of products in general may result in delays in transactions as our customers and our sales force adapt to such price changes and may have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
moreover  customer demand and competition in the market may require us to offer alternative methods of licensing our products 
in the event that we offer alternative methods of licensing our products  the revenues generated from licenses based on such alternative methods may not offset the loss of revenues from our existing method of licensing our products in any given period and may have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
dependence on a third party manufacturer  service providers and developers we rely primarily on a single independent third party to produce and distribute our products 
if there is a temporary or permanent disruption of our supply from such manufacturer  we may not be able to replace the supply in sufficient time to meet the demand for our products 
any such failure to meet the demand for our products would adversely affect our revenues and might cause some users to purchase licenses to our competitors products to meet their requirements 
in addition  we rely on a limited number of independent third parties to provide support services to our customers 
if any of such third party service providers terminates its relationship with us or ceases to be able to continue to maintain such relationship with us  we may not have sufficient notice or time to avoid serious disruption to our business 
furthermore  if any such third party service providers fail to provide adequate or satisfactory support for our products  our reputation as well as the success of our products may be adversely affected 
moreover  we have and may continue to  outsource specific development and quality assurance activities for certain of our products 
if such third party developers are not able to complete the development activities on time  the release of the corresponding new product or a new version may be delayed 
in addition  since we are 
table of contents 
index to financial statements unable to control the development activities outsourced by us to third parties  the portions of our product developed by such third parties may contain significant errors or bugs 
we depend on technologies licensed to us by third parties we license and distribute third party products as bundled with or embedded in our products 
if any of these licenses from third parties were terminated or were not renewed  we might not be able to ship our products in which these technologies are bundled or embedded 
we would then have to seek an alternative to such third party technology to the extent that such an alternative exists 
this could result in delays in releasing and or shipping our products  increased costs or reduced functionality of our products and material reduction in our net revenues 
we are dependent on our distributors a substantial majority of our revenues are derived from the sale of our software products through a variety of distribution channels  including traditional software distributors  educational distributors  vars  oems  hardware and software superstores and retail dealers 
domestically  our products are sold primarily through distributors  vars and oems 
our ability to effectively distribute products depends in part upon the financial and business condition of our reseller network 
although we have not experienced any material problems with our reseller network  computer software dealers and distributors are typically not highly capitalized and have experienced difficulties during times of economic contraction and may do so in the future 
one distributor  ingram micro  inc  accounted for approximately of our consolidated net revenues in each of fiscal years  and the loss of or a significant reduction in business with any one of our major international distributors or large us dealers could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated results of operations in future periods 
in addition  while our products are distributed through different levels of distribution channels  we maintain direct contractual relationships with primarily the first tier distributors  generally relying on such distributors to manage the relationship with second tier distributors and resellers with respect to the distribution  marketing and promotion of our licenses 
although we receive periodic reports from most of the distributors and resellers of our products  our reliance on our first tier distributors to assist us in managing the lower level distribution channels limits our ability to i anticipate and respond to excess inventory levels of  or change in demand for  our products by lower tier distributors or resellers  ii directly manage the marketing or promotion of our products by such lower tier distributors or resellers and iii monitor the adequacy of training received with respect to our products by employees of such lower tier distributors or resellers 
therefore  if our first tier distributors are unable to continue to effectively assist us in managing the lower tier distribution channels  the demand for and reputation of  our products may decrease and our operations and our financial results may be materially and adversely effected 
product returns could exceed our estimates and harm our net revenues the primary sales channels into which we sell our products throughout the world are a network of distributors and vars 
agreements with our distributors and vars contain specific product return privileges for stock rotation and obsolete products 
in general  we would expect sales returns to increase following the announcement of new or upgraded versions of our products or in anticipation of such product announcements  as our distributors and resellers seek to reduce their inventory levels of the prior version of a product in advance of receiving the new version 
similarly  we would expect that product inventory held by our distributors and resellers would increase following the successful introduction of new or upgraded products  as these resellers stock the new version in anticipation of end user demand  which would result in a decrease in our allowance for sales returns 
as part of our revenue recognition practices  we have established a reserve for estimated sales returns 
these reserves are based on a number of factors  including channel inventory levels and the timing of new product introductions 
if actual product returns exceed our reserve estimates  such excess would have an adverse effect on our net revenues and our results of operations 
adverse economic conditions may affect our ability to sublease vacated portions of properties held under sublease in fiscal year  we executed a restructuring plan to deliver cost synergies associated with our prior acquisitions and to better align our cost structure with the weaker business environment 
during fiscal year 
table of contents 
index to financial statements  our restructuring expenses included  among others  costs related to canceling or vacating approximately  square feet of facility space held under our operating leases 
we currently lease  square feet of space in northern california  under operating leases which expire between and  of which  square feet of space is not currently occupied by us and is currently subleased or being marketed for sublease

our restructuring expenses and accruals involves significant estimates made by management using the best information available at the time that the estimates were made  some of which we have obtained and verified through third party advisors 
these estimates include  among others  timing and market conditions of rental payments and sublease income 
any future reductions in operations  including staff reductions  may result in us vacating additional portions of properties held under operating leases prior to the expiration of the corresponding lease agreements 
the general adverse economic conditions in the areas in which we have significant leased properties have resulted in a surplus of business facilities making it difficult to sublease properties 
if the adverse economic and real estate conditions continue  or if we are unable to successfully market and sublease excess facilities on terms acceptable to us  we may be unable to sublease our excess leased properties  or we may not meet our expected estimated levels of subleasing income and our results of operations could be adversely affected 
system failure related to our websites could harm our business we rely  in part  on our websites as portals for marketing  selling and supporting our products 
substantially all of the system hardware for deploying and maintaining our websites are hosted by a third party 
these systems are subject to damage from earthquakes  floods  fires  power loss  telecommunication failures  computer viruses and similar events 
they are also subject to acts of vandalism and to potential disruption if our third party service provider experiences financial difficulties 
any event that causes interruption in the deployment of our websites could result in disruption in the services we provide  loss of revenues  or damage to our reputation 
risk associated with acquisitions we have entered into business combinations with other companies in the past  including two acquisitions in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and our acquisition of allaire in fiscal year and may make additional acquisitions in the future 
acquisitions generally involve significant risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations  services  technologies and corporate culture of the acquired companies  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  overvaluation of the acquired companies and the acceptance of the acquired companies products and services by our customers 
in addition  future acquisitions would likely result in dilution to existing stockholders  if stock or stock options are issued  or the assumption of debt and contingent liabilities  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
accordingly  any future acquisitions could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we may not be able to defend or enforce our intellectual property rights adequately because we are a software company  our business is dependent on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trade secret and trademark laws  as well as employee and third party nondisclosure agreements and license agreements  to protect our intellectual property rights and products 
policing unauthorized use of products and fully protecting our proprietary rights are difficult and we cannot guarantee that the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate 
in addition  effective patent  copyright  trade secret and trademark protection may not be available in every country in which our products are distributed 
in particular  while we are unable to determine the exact extent of piracy of our software products  software piracy may depress our revenues 
while this would also adversely affect domestic revenue  revenue loss from piracy of our software products is believed to be even more significant outside of the united states  particularly in countries where laws are less protective of intellectual property rights 
we are subject to intellectual property litigation we are currently and may be involved in the future in legal disputes relating to the validity or alleged infringement of our  or of a third party s  intellectual property

index to financial statements rights 
intellectual property litigation is typically extremely costly  unpredictable and can be disruptive to our business operations by diverting the attention and energies of our management and key technical personnel 
in addition  any adverse decisions  including injunctions or damage awards entered against us  could subject us to significant liabilities  require us to seek licenses from others  prevent us from distributing or licensing certain of our products  or cause severe disruptions to our operations or the markets in which we compete  any one of which could adversely impact our business and results of operations 
we may not be able to attract or retain key personnel our future growth and success depend  in part  on the continued service of our highly skilled employees  including  but not limited to  our management team 
our ability to attract and retain employees is dependent on a number of factors  including our continued ability to provide stock incentive awards  competitive cash compensation and cash bonuses 
the loss of key employees or an inability to effectively recruit new employees  as needed  could have a material adverse affect on our business and our ability to grow in the future 
we may fail to adequately evolve our internal systems and processes in a changing business environment our ability to continue to operate our business successfully and efficiently in a rapidly evolving market requires effective planning and management of our internal systems and processes 
we expect that we will need to continue to improve our financial and operational controls and our reporting systems and procedures 
if we fail to continue to evolve our systems and processes as appropriate  our ability to manage our business and results of operations may be negatively impacted 
legislative actions may cause our operating expenses to increase the sarbanes oxley act of and newly proposed or enacted rules and regulations of the sec or the nasdaq stock market impose new duties on us and our executives  directors  attorneys and independent auditors 
in order to comply with the sarbanes oxley act and any new rules promulgated by the sec or nasdaq  we may be required to hire additional personnel and use additional outside legal  accounting and advisory services 
any of these developments could materially increase our operating expenses and  accordingly  adversely affect our results of operations 
future impairment assessments on certain intangible assets may result in additional impairment charges on april   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
accordingly  our goodwill and other intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life are no longer amortized  but instead  reviewed at least annually for impairment 
significant changes in demand for our products or changes in market conditions in the principal markets in which we sell our products  could adversely impact the carrying value of these intangible assets 
in particular  if there is i a significant and other than temporary decline in the market value of our common stock  ii a decrease in the market value of a particular asset and iii operating or cash flow losses combined with forecasted future losses  we could be required to record impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets  which could adversely affect our financial results 
in addition  should we develop and manage our business using discrete financial information for reporting units in the future  we may be required to allocate our goodwill balance to those reporting units  which may result in an impairment of part or all of our recorded goodwill 
changes in generally accepted accounting principles gaap may affect our reported results we prepare our financial statements in conformity with gaap 
gaap is subject to interpretation by the sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies 
a change in these policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may affect the reporting of transactions completed prior to the announcement of a change 
for example  in order to prepare our gaap financial statements  a number of estimates are used by our management  particularly with regard to the impact of product returns from our distributors and vars when determining license revenues to be recognized  our allowance for doubtful accounts  our restructuring plans  amortization of intangible assets and accounting for income taxes 
our management uses the best available information at the time to create estimates  however  actual future results may vary from these estimates

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we invest our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of financial instruments  consisting primarily of us dollar denominated commercial paper  highly liquid corporate debt securities  money market funds and interest bearing accounts with financial institutions 
cash balances in foreign currencies are primarily invested in money market funds and interest bearing bank accounts with financial institutions 
we account for our short term investments in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
cash equivalents and all of our short term investments are recorded as available for sale 
when the original maturity is greater than one year  the securities are classified as short term as it is our intention to convert them into cash for operations within one year 
cash equivalents and short term investments include primarily fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments  which carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
we mitigate our interest rate risk by investing in instruments with short maturities 
we ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by placing these investments with high credit quality issuers 
we maintain portfolio liquidity by ensuring that underlying investments have active secondary or resale markets

foreign currency risk our international operations are subject to risks typical of an international business  including  but not limited to differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange volatility 
accordingly  our future results could be materially impacted by changes in these or other factors 
we sell our products internationally in us dollars and certain foreign currencies  primarily the euro  japanese yen and british pound 
we regularly enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to offset the impact 
table of contents 
index to financial statements of currency fluctuations on certain foreign currency revenues and operating expenses as well as subsequent receivables and payables 
management s strategy is to reduce the risk to earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
in fiscal year  we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities 
sfas no 
requires that all derivatives be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
upon adoption  we did not designate any foreign exchange forward contracts as sfas no 
accounting hedges and did not record any transition adjustments 
our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations arises from the sale of products internationally in foreign currencies and from expenses in foreign currencies to support those sales 
we have a risk management program to reduce the effect of foreign exchange transaction gains and losses from recorded foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities 
this program involves the use of foreign exchange forward contracts in certain currencies  primarily the euro  japanese yen and british pound 
a foreign exchange forward contract obligates us to exchange predetermined amounts of specified foreign currencies at specified exchange rates on specified dates 
under this program  increases or decreases in our foreign currency transactions are partially offset by gains and losses on the foreign exchange forward contracts  so as to mitigate the income statement impact of significant foreign currency exchange rate movements 
we do not use foreign exchange forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
cash flow hedging 
in fiscal year  we began designating and documenting foreign exchange forward contracts related to forecasted transactions as cash flow hedges and as a result  we began applying hedge accounting for these contracts 
the critical terms of the foreign exchange forward contracts and the forecasted underlying transactions are matched at inception and forward contract effectiveness is calculated  at least quarterly  by comparing the change in the fair value of the contracts to the change in fair value of the forecasted revenues or expenses  with the effective portion of the fair value of the hedges recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci 
we record any ineffective portion of the hedging instruments  which was immaterial in fiscal year  in other income expense on our consolidated statements of operations 
when the underlying forecasted transactions occur and impact earnings  the related gain or loss on the cash flow hedge is reclassified to net revenues or expenses 
in the event it becomes probable that the forecasted transactions will not occur  the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedges would be reclassified from aoci to other income expense at that time 
all values reported in aoci at march  will be reclassified to earnings in eight months or less 
at march   the outstanding cash flow hedging derivatives had maturities of twelve months or less 
balance sheet hedging 
we manage our foreign currency risk associated with foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities using foreign exchange forward contracts 
these derivative instruments are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded in other income expense 
these derivative instruments substantially offset the remeasurement gains and losses recorded on identified foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities 
at march   our outstanding balance sheet hedging derivatives had maturities of twelve months or less
