overview agilent technologies  inc we  agilent or the company  incorporated in delaware in may  is a global diversified technology company that provides enabling solutions to markets within the communications  electronics  life sciences and chemical analysis industries 
prior to our initial public offering of percent of our stock in november  we were a wholly owned subsidiary of hewlett packard company hewlett packard 
hewlett packard distributed the remaining percent of our stock to its stockholders on june  in the form of a stock dividend 
on august  we completed the sale of our healthcare solutions business to koninklijke philips electronics  nv the results of the healthcare solutions business are presented as discontinued operations for all periods in the consolidated financial statements included herein 
see note  discontinued operations in item of this report 
our fiscal year end is october unless otherwise stated  all years and dates refer to our fiscal year 
reclassifications amounts in the consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended october  and october  have been reclassified to conform to the presentation used in critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable 
although these estimates are based on management s best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future  actual results may be different from the estimates 
our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult  subjective or complex judgments by management 
those policies are revenue recognition  restructuring and asset impairment charges  inventory valuation  retirement and post retirement plan assumptions  valuation of long lived assets and accounting for income taxes 
revenue recognition 
we enter into agreements to sell products hardware and or software  services  and other arrangements multiple element arrangements that include combinations of products and services 
revenue from product sales  net of trade discounts and allowances  is recognized provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has 
table of contents 
index to financial statements occurred  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer 
revenue is reduced for estimated product returns and distributor price protection  when appropriate 
for sales that include customer specified acceptance criteria  revenue is recognized after the acceptance criteria have been met 
for products that include installation  if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element  product revenue is recognized upon delivery  and recognition of installation revenue is delayed until the installation is complete 
otherwise  neither the product nor the installation revenue is recognized until the installation is complete 
revenue from services is deferred and recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer 
when arrangements include multiple elements  we use objective evidence of fair value to allocate revenue to the elements and recognize revenue when the criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element 
the amount of product revenue recognized is affected by our judgments as to whether an arrangement includes multiple elements and if so  whether vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists for those elements 
changes to the elements in an arrangement and the ability to establish vendor specific objective evidence for those elements could affect the timing of the revenue recognition 
most of these conditions are subjective and actual results could vary from the estimated outcome  requiring future adjustments to revenue 
restructuring and asset impairment charges 
we recognize a liability for restructuring costs at fair value only when the liability is incurred 
the three main components of our restructuring plans are related to workforce reductions  the consolidation of excess facilities and asset impairments  primarily property  plant and equipment 
workforce related charges are accrued when it is determined that a liability has been incurred which is generally after individuals have been notified of their termination dates and expected severance payments 
plans to consolidate excess facilities result in charges for lease termination fees and future commitments to pay lease charges  net of estimated future sublease income 
we recognize charges for consolidation of excess facilities when we have vacated the premises 
asset impairment charges are based on an estimate of the amounts and timing of future cash flows related to the expected future remaining use and ultimate sale or disposal of buildings and equipment 
these estimates were derived using the guidance of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 
 staff accounting bulletin  restructuring and impairment charges sab  emerging issues task force  liability recognition for costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring eitf and lastly  sfas no 
accounting for exit or disposal activities sfas no 
which is effective for exit and disposal activities initiated after december  if the amounts and timing of cash flows from restructuring activities are significantly different from what we have estimated  the actual amount of restructuring and asset impairment charges could be materially different  either higher or lower  than those we have recorded 
inventory valuation 
we assess the valuation of our inventory on a quarterly basis and periodically write down the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon estimates about future demand and actual usage 
such estimates are difficult to make under current economic conditions 
the excess balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess inventory charge 
our marketing department plays a key role in our excess inventory review process by providing updated sales forecasts  managing product rollovers and working with manufacturing to maximize recovery of excess inventory 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional write downs may be required 
if actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated  inventory previously written down may be sold  resulting in lower cost of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period 
retirement and post retirement plan assumptions 
retirement and post retirement benefit plans are a significant cost of doing business and yet represent obligations that will be ultimately settled far in the future and therefore are subject to estimation 
pension accounting is 
table of contents 
index to financial statements intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employee s approximate service period based on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made by us 
we are required to make assumptions regarding such variables as the expected long term rate of return on assets and the discount rate applied to determine service cost and interest cost to arrive at pension income or expense for the year 
as of october   the expected long term rate of return in the us was percent  and ranged from to percent for our plans outside the us we have analyzed the rates of return on assets used and determined that these rates are reasonable based on the plans historical performance relative to the overall markets in the countries where the plans are effective 
management will continue to assess the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption for each plan based on relevant market conditions as prescribed by accounting principles generally accepted in the us and will make adjustments to the assumptions as appropriate 
discount rate assumptions were based on the prevailing market long term interest rates at the measurement date 
we are also required to make assumptions for the long term health care cost trend rates for our post retirement benefit plans 
if any of our assumptions were to change  our benefit plan expenses would also change 
a one percent decrease in the estimated return on plan assets would result in increased pension expense of million for in the us and million for for all plans outside the us retirement and post retirement benefit plan expense is allocated to cost of sales  research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations 
we incurred expenses of million in  million in and million in for our retirement and post retirement plans 
we expect expenses of approximately million in for our retirement and post retirement plans 
workforce related events such as restructuring cause curtailment and settlement gains or losses when they have a material impact on the average future working lifetime or total number of participants in our retirement and postretirement plans 
our restructuring programs have resulted in material changes to our plan demographics in the us and several other countries in and the curtailment and settlement gains and losses related to each event are separately identified in note  retirement plans and post retirement benefits to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
valuation of long lived assets 
we have assessed the recoverability of long lived assets  including intangible assets  by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted future cash flows according to the guidance of sfas no 
and discounted future cash flows according to the guidance of sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill and other intangibles is highly subjective and requires significant judgment 
we estimate expected future cash flows of our various businesses which operate in a number of markets and geographical regions 
we then determine the carrying value of these businesses 
we exercise judgment in assigning and allocating certain assets and liabilities to these businesses 
we make these estimates consistent with the way we forecast  plan and run our businesses 
we then compare the carrying value including goodwill and other intangibles to the discounted future cash flows 
if the total of future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets  we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
estimates of the future cash flows associated with the assets are critical to these assessments 
changes in these estimates based on changed economic conditions or business strategies could result in material impairment charges in future periods 
we performed the required transitional impairment test upon our adoption of sfas no 
in the first quarter of and wrote off million of goodwill 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of long lived assets such as our property plant and equipment according to sfas no 
is also highly subjective and requires significant judgment 
in order to estimate the fair value of long lived assets  we typically make various assumptions about the future prospects for the business that the asset relates to  consider market factors specific to that business and estimate future cash flows to be generated by that business 

table of contents 
index to financial statements based on these assumptions and estimates  we determine whether we need to take an impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset stated on our balance sheet to reflect its estimated fair value 
assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as the real estate market  industry and economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate  changes in assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results 
accounting for income taxes 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part 
when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets such as net operating losses or foreign tax credit carryforwards will not be realized  a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that are determined not to be realizable 
realization is based on our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income 
during the third quarter of  we recorded a non cash charge to establish a tax valuation allowance of billion  which included approximately billion of tax benefits recorded during the first six months of  resulting in approximately billion net tax provision recorded within provision for taxes for  the valuation allowance essentially eliminated our net deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance was determined in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for income taxes sfas no 
 which requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will be recoverable in future periods  such assessment is required on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
cumulative losses incurred in the us and the uk in recent years represented sufficient negative evidence under sfas no 
to require a full valuation allowance in these jurisdictions 
we intend to maintain a full valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal 
we expect future pre tax income in fiscal will be recognized at a lower rate because future income taxes in the us and the u 
k will be offset against reversals of the valuation allowance to effectively eliminate any tax charge in those jurisdictions 
additionally  to the degree we have pre tax losses in the us and us  no tax benefit will be recognized until such time as the valuation allowance is reversed 
income taxes will continue to be recorded for various jurisdictions subject to the need for further valuation allowance in those jurisdictions 
we have not provided for us federal income and foreign withholding taxes on a portion of our non us subsidiaries undistributed income as of october  because we intend to reinvest such income indefinitely 
if management decides to remit this income to the us in a future period  our provision for income taxes may increase materially in that period 
we are subject to ongoing tax examinations of our tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities in various jurisdictions 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
cyclical and seasonal business and general economic conditions the sales of our products and services are dependent  to a large degree  on customers whose industries are subject to cyclical trends in the demand for their products 
shifts in the semiconductor market  electronics industry  computer industry and telecommunications markets  as well as rapidly shifting global economic conditions  have had and will have significant impacts on our businesses 
in those industry segments where we are a capital equipment provider  our revenue is driven by the capital expenditure budgets and spending patterns of our customers  who often delay or 
table of contents 
index to financial statements accelerate purchases in reaction to changes in their businesses and in the economy 
we expect some portions of our businesses to remain cyclical in the foreseeable future 
given that a high proportion of our costs are fixed  variability in revenue as a result of these business cycles could disproportionately affect our quarterly and annual results 
however  we are moving towards a more variable cost structure through the use of outsourcing partners and instituting variable pay programs for our employees in order to reduce the proportion of our costs that have typically been fixed in nature 
additionally  we estimate that approximately percent of our revenue is generated either directly from sales of components incorporated in consumer electronics  such as cell phones  cameras  games  personal computers  and printers  or indirectly from sales of test and measurement equipment used to design or manufacture and test such components or products 
sales of these consumer electronic products are concentrated during the holiday season 
this seasonal pattern means that we typically experience higher revenues and orders during our fourth quarter as manufacturers ramp up production and then decline in our first quarter 
we also see larger volumes of business in our fourth quarter for products that we sell to the aerospace and defense industry and the us government and generally experience reduced volumes during our first quarter 
in  an economic downturn reduced consumer and capital spending in most of the markets that we serve 
this economic downturn continued through and has stabilized throughout more recently we have seen signs of an economic upturn  although it is uncertain as to how strongly this may be sustained in the markets we serve over the next year 
orders and revenue in our semiconductor products  automated test and life sciences business segments during increased compared to however  this is offset by the continued decline in the wireline telecommunication and general purpose test markets within our test and measurement group and a recovery in these markets is not expected for some time 
in  total net revenue was flat compared to  but decreased percent from orders followed the same trend 
in  orders were flat compared to  but decreased by six percent from restructuring and asset impairment summary we currently have three restructuring plans one initiated in the fourth quarter of the plan  a second initiated in the fourth quarter of the plan  and a third initiated in the first quarter of the plan after it became clear that the actions taken in fiscal and fiscal would not be sufficient to return the company to profitability 
all of our plans were designed to reduce costs and expenses in order to return the company to profitability 
as of the end of  we have reduced our workforce by approximately  people approximately  from involuntary terminations and approximately  from net attrition to  employees 
our plans to consolidate excess facilities resulted in charges for lease termination fees and losses anticipated from sub lease agreements 
we have exited  or plan to exit in the near future  more than production  support and sales facilities in the us  korea  japan  us and other countries  representing more than million square feet  or about percent of our worldwide property 
as of october   we had vacated approximately percent of this space  however we will continue to make lease payments on some of this space over the next five years 
we lease most of these buildings from third parties  and the closures impacted all segments 
in most cases  we are exiting administrative office buildings housing sales and administrative employees 
however  a small number of production facilities were closed as a result of our plans to consolidate manufacturing into fewer sites 

table of contents 
index to financial statements actions for all plans have been focused on segments that were impacted most severely by the market downturn primarily our test and measurement and semiconductor products groups but actions have also been taken to reduce the costs associated with support services such as finance  information technology  workplace services and to a lesser extent our other business segments 
cost reductions were initiated by moving manufacturing and some of our global shared services operations sites to lower cost regions  reducing the number of properties  particularly sales and administrative sites  and by reducing our workforce through involuntary terminations and selected outsourcing of manufacturing and administrative functions 
our strategy is to move towards a more variable operating cost structure 
we have executed all key actions under our plan  although there may be changes in estimates for the consolidation of excess facilities due to changes in market conditions from those originally expected at the time the charges were recorded 
our plan is substantially complete 
we are continuing to see the estimated savings of million per quarter million from the plan and million from the plan that was initially projected 
the plan is still being implemented  however  we have already begun to realize the expected million reduction in quarterly operational costs 
we expect to incur further restructuring costs and increase the savings related to the plan in the first half of the plan as a result of the economic downturn we announced a plan and reduced our workforce by approximately  jobs and reduced costs across all functions  primarily manufacturing and selling  general and administrative costs  including sales and marketing 
research and development activities were terminated on some product development initiatives  none of which were individually or in total significant to our future revenues or profitability 
we also took actions to reduce the number of employees at production facilities that had experienced declining demand  such as those making equipment for the long haul wireline business 
this plan was designed to reduce costs across almost all of our administrative and support services  including sales and marketing  and to focus our production activities on those products that we believed would return us to profitability  such as those in life sciences  semiconductor test and wireless telecommunications 
our plan impacted the test and measurement group and the semiconductor products group and had little direct impact on the automated test and life sciences and chemical analysis groups except as the plan related to support services reductions across all of our businesses 
we reduced production capacity dramatically for communications test product lines and for product lines in networking  especially long haul networks 
we also reduced production capacity for some personal systems  general purpose and semiconductor test product lines 
the three main components of the plan related to workforce reductions  consolidation of excess facilities and impairments of property  plant and equipment 
the impairments of machinery and equipment in our production facilities that we have closed or scaled back have been recognized 
we have executed all key actions under this plan  however we will continue to make lease payments over the next five years 
asset impairment charges relate to fixed assets and were determined using estimates of the expected future cash flows generated from those assets 
impairments were recorded for machinery and equipment in production facilities that we were closing or scaling back  such as for the long haul wireline business and for leasehold improvements in leased facilities that we planned to exit 
one production facility in kobe  japan accounted for approximately million of the million of asset impairment charges in in order to determine the amount of the impairment  under the held for use model in accordance with sfas no 
 we estimated the cash flows that would result from our continued use of the building until we expect to vacate it and also estimated the sales 
table of contents 
index to financial statements proceeds that we expected to be able to realize 
the resulting impairment was approximately percent of the net book value of the facility  primarily due to the decline in the local property market 
in  we also took a million charge for exiting a number of leased facilities 
during we recorded an additional million in net charges and adjustments due primarily to reductions in our estimate of expected sublease income 
due to the length of some of the lease terms and the uncertainty of the real estate market  we expect to make periodic adjustments to the accrual balance to reflect changes in our estimates  and to reflect actual events as they occur

the plan on august   we announced our intention to further reduce our workforce by  to achieve a quarterly operating cost structure of approximately billion 
this plan primarily affected the manufacturing and field operations serving the wireline markets that are components of our test and measurement group as well as information technology support services 
as part of the plan we have reduced our workforce by approximately  as of october  similar to the plan  this reduction impacted all regions  all expense categories and most of our segments particularly our test and measurement and semiconductor products segments 
we continued to reduce the number of employees at production facilities that experienced declining demand  outsourced selective operations and also reduced the number of

we expect that the plan will be completed by the first quarter of we have incurred total asset impairment charges of million 
asset impairment charges of million recognized in relate to machinery and equipment  primarily owned by the semiconductor products group in singapore 
the equipment had been purchased in support of communications research but as a result of our restructuring plans we have decided to sell the equipment and conduct the research using existing equipment in the us asset impairment charges of million recognized in primarily related to semiconductor products machinery and equipment that will be abandoned 
the equipment had been purchased to support a manufacturing facility whose operations will be moved as a result of our plans to consolidate our excess facilities 
however  no material charges for the consolidation of excess facilities have yet occurred under the plan

in order to accomplish this  we announced a workforce reduction of approximately  jobs in addition to previously announced cuts 
as part of the plan we have reduced our workforce by approximately  as of october   primarily in our us operations 
reductions were made across all businesses with significant reductions in our test and measurement and semiconductor products groups 
we continued to reduce the number of employees at production facilities and employees that provide support services across all businesses 
we have also reduced the number of research and development employees as we continue to look for opportunities to align our business with available markets 
as we execute on all of our plans  we have continued to consolidate excess facilities 
we have and plan to exit administrative office buildings  research and development facilities  and move

index to financial statements manufacturing to lower cost regions 
our plan to consolidate excess facilities resulted in increased charges of million for lease termination fees and losses anticipated from sub lease agreements primarily located in europe 
as part of the plan  we incurred asset impairment charges of million for fixed assets primarily owned by our semiconductor products segment 
impairments were recorded for machinery  equipment and buildings used in research and development or production that are impacted by our plans to consolidate excess facilities or are no longer needed due to over capacity 
during the third quarter  we closed a production facility in the uk and have substantially vacated the remaining buildings on that site except for a minor portion of the facility  which will be used for research and development 
we are progressing as planned through our transition towards reestablishing production in singapore and have entered into an agreement to sell the site to a third party 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we measured the assets at their fair value based on the sales agreement less the cost to sell 
we recorded an impairment of million as a result of the significant decline in the uk property market 
although we are still implementing the plan  we have realized the expected million reduction in quarterly operational costs from the reductions in salary and benefit expenses due to the workforce reductions under the plan 
as of october   the cost of the plan was million

lease payments are expected over the next years 
other payments  primarily severance  are expected within a one year period 
we have met our expected savings goals for all of our restructuring plans 
future charges should be primarily associated with our plan 
as our restructuring plans were all intended to return agilent to profitability given predicted revenue amounts  we are unable to estimate the amount and timing of future restructuring charges

foreign currency our revenues  costs and expenses  and monetary assets and liabilities are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our global operating and financing activities 
we hedge net cash flow and balance sheet exposures that are not denominated in the functional currencies of our subsidiaries on a short term and anticipated basis 
we do experience some fluctuations within individual lines of the consolidated statement of operations and balance sheet as our hedging program is not designed to offset the currency movements in each category of revenues  expenses  monetary assets and liabilities 
however  movements in exchange rates net of our hedging activities had no material effect on our net loss in the periods presented 
for example  the weakening of the us dollar throughout led to an increase in revenue of approximately million  which primarily affected europe and asia pacific 
however  this was offset by an increase to cost of sales of approximately million and an increase to operating expenses of approximately million 
our hedging activities resulted in an increase of cost of sales of approximately million 
effective november   we determined that the functional currency for many of our subsidiaries outside the us changed from the us dollar to local currency based on the criteria of sfas no 
foreign currency translation 
this change did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position as of november  indemnifications indemnifications to hewlett packard company we have given multiple indemnities to hewlett packard company in connection with our activities prior to our spin off from hewlett packard for the businesses that constituted agilent prior to the spin off 
these indemnifications cover a variety of aspects of our business  including  but not limited to  employee  tax  intellectual property and environmental matters 
the agreements containing these indemnifications have been previously disclosed as exhibits to our registration statement on form s filed on august  in our opinion  the fair value of these indemnifications is not material 
indemnifications to koninklijke philips electronics  nv philips in connection with the sale of our healthcare solutions business to philips on august   we indemnified philips for various matters  including product liability issues arising within two years of the sale agreement 
in our opinion  the fair value of these indemnifications is not material 
indemnifications to officers and directors our corporate by laws require that we indemnify our officers and directors  as well as those who act as directors and officers of other entities at our request  against expenses  judgments  fines  settlements and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any proceedings arising out of their services to agilent 
in addition  we have entered into separate indemnification agreements with each director and each board appointed officer of agilent which provides for indemnification of these directors and officers under similar circumstances and under additional circumstances 
the indemnification obligations are more fully described in the by laws and the indemnification agreements 
see exhibits and of this document 
we purchase standard insurance to cover claims or a portion of the claims made against our directors and officers 
since a maximum obligation is not explicitly stated in our by laws or in our indemnification agreements and 
table of contents 
index to financial statements will depend on the facts and circumstances that arise out of any future claims  the overall maximum amount of the obligations cannot be reasonably estimated 
historically  we have not made payments related to these obligations  and the fair value for these obligations is zero on the consolidated balance sheet as of october  other indemnifications as is customary in our industry and as provided for in local law in the us and other jurisdictions  many of our standard contracts provide remedies to our customers and others with whom we enter into contracts  such as defense  settlement  or payment of judgment for intellectual property claims related to the use of our products 
from time to time  we indemnify customers  as well as our suppliers  contractors  lessors  lessees  companies that purchase our businesses or assets and others with whom we enter into contracts  against combinations of loss  expense  or liability arising from various triggering events related to the sale and the use of our products and services  the use of their goods and services  the use of facilities and state of our owned facilities  the state of the assets and businesses that we sell and other matters covered by such contracts  usually up to a specified maximum amount 
in addition  from time to time we also provide protection to these parties against claims related to undiscovered liabilities  additional product liability or environmental obligations 
in our experience  claims made under such indemnifications are rare and the associated estimated fair value of the liability is not material 
results of continuing operations the loss from continuing operations increased for a third year to  million in from  million in and million in the increase in loss from to of approximately million was primarily due to our provision for income taxes for which included a  million net tax provision related to our valuation allowance charge  which was offset by a reduction of million of goodwill amortization charges 
the increase in loss from to of approximately million related to a significant decrease in revenues as a result of the weak economy  which primarily affected our key market segments and million in additional restructuring charges offset by a million reduction in inventory charges in in the fourth quarter of  we saw signs of a market upturn in several of our business segments 
the fourth quarter orders of  million represented our highest level of orders since the first quarter of prior to the fourth quarter  orders were stagnant for the past ten quarters at a level around  million on the average 
we remain cautiously optimistic about our recent growth in orders and believe that a recovery in the economy will be gradual 
we realigned our businesses in response to weakened economic conditions 
we have achieved our goal of reducing our quarterly operating cost structure to billion 
as long as revenue amounts do not fall below billion in the long term  we believe that we will be able to sustain operational breakeven 
this goal was primarily accomplished through savings generated from our restructuring plans 
we have reduced our workforce to  employees from a peak of  in april we have also consolidated excess manufacturing facilities  moved many of our global shared services to lower cost regions and have outsourced selective functions and processes 
we have also reduced our indirect spending by approximately million 
this reduction was accomplished by decreasing the number of vendors with whom we do business in order to maximize vendor discounts and by putting in place new policies that provide stricter guidelines for handling business expenses such as travel  mobile phone services and usage  consulting covered by professional service agreements  supplies and equipment 
overall  we have decreased our operating expenses from by on a dollar basis despite a million increase in major information technology project costs 
we are committed to maintaining this cost structure as a percentage of revenue on average throughout the business cycle

geographically  revenue increased in europe and asia pacific and declined in the us  canada  latin america collectively referred to as the americas 
the decrease in the americas was primarily a result of our customers shifting their production facilities from americas to asia pacific 
growth in our asian and european markets also contributed to the revenue increase in those regions 
we expect to see further growth in asia pacific as companies expand their capacity and as more contract manufacturers move to these lower cost regions 
we also expect to see a modest improvement in the americas as the economy in the us recovers and the excess supply of used equipment is depleted 
net revenue declined in as compared to primarily due to continued weakness in key market segments  particularly wireless and wireline telecommunications  as well as pricing pressures from both customers and competitors in the face of a weak economy 
declines in the americas and europe were higher than in asia pacific in part due to our customers buying infrastructure products in asia

inventory charges totaled million in  million in  and million in the abnormally high charges in were the result of the rapid and steep market decline that year  which caused excess inventory of then current products and made older products obsolete 
inventory charges in spanned the vast majority of our products and particularly impacted raw materials 
inventory charges in reflected continuing weakness in some of our largest markets  particularly in the telecommunications market 
we have seen a significant decline in inventory charges in compared to primarily due to our efforts to effectively manage our inventory levels

our research and development efforts focus on potential new products and product improvements covering a wide variety of technologies in communications  electronics  life sciences and chemical analysis  none of which is individually significant to our operations 
at our central research facility  agilent laboratories  we conduct five types of research and development basic research  which contributes to the fundamental understanding of areas anticipated to be important in the very long term  foundation technologies research  which enables fundamental advances across all businesses  communications research  which creates technologies to enable pervasive access to information  life sciences research  which enables new measurement solutions to facilitate the development of next generation pharmaceuticals and molecular diagnostics  and measurement research  which provides critical advances in test and measurement electronics and systems 
the research at agilent laboratories represents less than of agilent s consolidated spending on research and development and is intended to be relatively high in technical risk and to be the foundation for future products over a longer time horizon  generally five to ten years out 
the majority of our research and development is nearer term and occurs in agilent s four business segments 
this research and development is aimed at improving the more than  products already in production and on new product releases 
because of the large number of new and existing products and research and development projects across all of our businesses and at agilent laboratories  it is difficult to quantify the impact of any specific products or projects 
we are committed to bringing new products to the market and have focused our development efforts on key strategic opportunities in order to align our business with available markets and position ourselves to capture market share when the economy recovers

during the fourth quarter of  we maintained a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets in the us and the us the valuation allowance was determined in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
which requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable  such assessment is required on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
cumulative losses incurred in the us and the us in recent years represented sufficient negative evidence under sfas no

our restructuring efforts provided approximately million of savings 
we also reduced our indirect expenses by million  or percent in compared to cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue decreased in over primarily due to consolidation of manufacturing sites  transfer of some manufacturing lines from sonoma  california to penang  malaysia  and outsourcing of production activities such as the printed circuit assembly boards 
overall  our restructuring efforts provided million of savings 
the decrease was also attributable to million of reduced inventory charges 
these reductions were offset by a million increase due to changes in the mix of products we sold from relatively higher margin to relatively lower margin offerings  erosion in average selling prices  and an unfavorable currency impact of million 
the increase in compared to was primarily due to an overall decrease in net revenue offset by a decrease of million in inventory charges 
inventory charges totaled million in compared to million in and million in inventory charges in were primarily the result of decisions made to discontinue or exit several weak product families in the wireline market as we continued to rebalance our business portfolio 
inventory charges in primarily affected optical communications measurement products  inventory and raw materials 
inventory charges in resulted from the rapidly deteriorating conditions in the telecommunications and electronics markets  which hastened the obsolescence of older products  the charges affected parts for the majority of all product types

aggressive restructuring resulted in favorable comparable results  mainly driven by restructuring savings and lower inventory charges 
these favorable results were offset slightly by reduced revenue and changes in the mix of products we sold  from relatively higher margins to relatively lower margin offerings 
the restructuring plans contributed approximately million in savings and headcount was reduced by percent in savings resulted from reductions in employee related costs and from shifting manufacturing and sales into lower cost geographic regions 
we anticipate further headcount reduction in test and measurement throughout the first half of until completion of the restructuring programs currently underway 
reduced revenue also drove the loss from operations in compared to  weak sales overcame significant new product wins and restructuring savings during automated test our automated test segment provides test system solutions that are used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices and printed circuit assemblies

this increase was mainly driven by demand for customer products in computation pc chip sets  graphics and networking  digital consumer products and wireless products 
in the fourth quarter of  our automated test segment reached its highest level of quarterly orders since the fourth quarter of and has continued to achieve market growth through design wins 
we anticipate that this upturn in the second half of may be the beginning of a recovery 
the growth in orders for compared to was mainly driven by design wins in the us and by expanded production in the scms semiconductor contract manufacturers in asia  particularly for our soc system on a chip business 
growth was also driven by the idms integrated design manufacturers 
we introduced the v flash memory product new generation platform for flash memory test in which contributed to the growth of the flash memory test business 
orders in were adversely impacted by million cancellations at the end of the strong market cycle in the increase in net revenue for compared to was the result of increased sales of our products across the board in semiconductor test flash memory  system on a chip and electronic manufacturing test markets

net revenue from our semiconductor test products without the leasing impact showed a two percent increase driven by soc and flash memory products 
although service and support net revenue declined percent from  the share of total net revenue increased to percent from percent in net revenue from our electronic manufacturing test products declined percent from service revenue tends to be more stable than product revenue because service revenues reflect services offered on an installed base of products  which does not shift as quickly as orders or revenue for products and furthermore  support revenue is recognized over the life of the service contract 
service revenue declined in following the decline in product orders during support revenue lags hardware sales due to the warranty period following hardware sales and the method of revenue recognition 
support and services contracts sold with systems during the industry boom of were recognized as revenue ratably over the subsequent months  resulting in support and service revenue growth in system sales declined in and service revenue decreased in the second half of saw strong hardware sales

orders for our couplers also were strong in as expected  orders for hardcopy application specific integrated circuits asics  dropped sharply throughout the year 
excluding hardcopy asics  the personal systems market grew by percent compared to within our networking market  orders grew percent compared to  driven by strength in networking ics and modest growth in fiber optics 
networking ics orders were driven by strong growth in storage and networking asics and application specific standard products assps 
in fiber optics we saw strong demand for our ethernet products and received orders from new customers for our fibre channel transceivers sold primarily to storage networking customers

index to financial statements the overall increase in orders for compared to was the result of growth in our personal systems products  partially offset by reductions in our networking products 
in personal systems  we saw orders growth of percent for our imaging products and percent for general optoelectronic components while orders for our wireless products were flat from the prior year 
the growth in our imaging products benefited from an unexpected one time increase in these asic orders from hewlett packard in when some of their other suppliers failed to meet demand and we were able to capture additional business 
in networking  our optical products declined percent compared to while our smaller overall orders for integrated circuits grew percent 
revenue was up percent in compared to moreover  revenues increased each quarter from the first quarter through the fourth quarter in the growth was driven by strength in the camera modules used in mobile phones and optical mice products  wireless components  networking asics  and couplers 
currency had a favorable impact on revenue growth as well 
this growth  however was offset in part by the decline in hardcopy asic products 
semiconductor markets remained highly competitive resulting in the erosion of average selling prices across all product lines 
fiscal years and were periods of declining orders and revenues due to end market decrease in demand 
non recurring royalty revenue relating to changes in our agreement with adaptec inc in also contributed million to the decrease in the comparison between and no individual new product had a material impact on results in revenue from sales to hewlett packard  consisting primarily of hardcopy asics and motion control products  represented percent of the business total net revenue for  down from percent in and percent in the previously mentioned decline in the hewlett packard hardcopy asics business and growth in other products caused revenue from hewlett packard sales to drop as a percentage of total net revenues 
we expect this decline to continue into however  we are offsetting this reduction with growth in existing mobile and networking products and new product introductions to other customers 
looking forward to  we anticipate order and revenue growth across a wide range of products in our personal systems and networking markets 
in the personal systems market  demand for consumer products  such as mobile phones  is expected to drive growth in our camera modules  analog front end modules  and optoelectronic components

table of contents 
index to financial statements over the past two years we have implemented cost reduction and restructuring plans to return us to profitability and attain operational excellence 
we shut down several fabrication facilities in the united states and europe and moved to a flexible  variable cost structure  with more than percent of our manufacturing outsourced 
we reduced indirect expenses by million  or percent  in compared to other cost control actions include the reduction of direct material costs  the cancellation of several long term research and development projects  and system savings generated by full implementation of the erp system as multiple outdated systems were turned off 
in and  we reduced average headcount by percent per year compared to and  respectively 
overall savings from restructuring in totaled about million for the full year and in totaled million for the full year 
cost of products as a percentage of net revenue increased slightly in compared to  as restructuring savings  lower infrastructure costs  and better yields on new products were offset by erosion in our average selling prices 
the rate of erosion was relatively stable in all product lines 
the erosion of average selling prices of established products is typical of the industry and improvements in pricing must be based on new products 
consistent with trends in the semiconductor markets  we anticipate that average selling prices will continue to deteriorate in however  as part of our normal course of business  we plan to offset this deterioration with ongoing cost reduction activities and new product introductions 
the decrease in cost of products as a percentage of net revenue in compared to despite overall reduced revenue was a direct result of the plan  savings from restructuring reduced total cost of products by approximately million for the year 
the sale of previously written down inventory  due to unanticipated demand for products previously considered to be unmarketable  also impacted the comparison 
specifically  in we sold million in inventory that we had previously written down 
this inventory was for general fiber optics  image sensors  and base optoelectronic products 
however  in we sold million of previously written down inventory  primarily for imaging and navigation  general fiber optics  telecom fiber optics  and hardcopy asics products 
in  we had inventory charges of million due to the dramatic decline of market conditions  the charges affected raw materials used in all of our major products  including imaging and navigation  telecom fiber optics  general fiber optics  hardcopy asics and couplers 
the decrease in research and development expenses and selling and general administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue in compared to was primarily a result of restructuring efforts  lower infrastructure costs  and the previously mentioned cost control activities 
as mentioned above  we also experienced cost savings from the implementation of our erp system 
in spite of these actions  investments are being focused on key markets 
research and development and selling and general administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue were flat for compared to loss from operations the operating loss of million improved by million compared to  even though revenue increased by only million 
the improvement in operating results was primarily the result of the previously mentioned restructuring and cost reduction activities and increased demand for new products  which offset erosion in our average selling prices 
the reduced loss from operations in compared to was the result of reduced inventory charges and our cost containment measures

we provide lease guarantees on these financing arrangements and we have no other material guarantees or commitments 
see note  other accrued liabilities in item of this report for further information on our non cancelable operating leases 
our liquidity is affected by many factors  some of which are based on normal ongoing operations of our business and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global economics and markets 
our cash balances are generated and held in many locations throughout the world 
local government regulations may restrict our ability to move cash balances to meet cash needs under certain circumstances 
we do not currently expect such regulations and restrictions to impact our ability to pay vendors and conduct operations throughout our global organization 
on february  standard and poor s rating services lowered its corporate credit and senior note ratings for agilent to speculative grade status  from bbb minus to bb 
on may  moody s investors service downgraded our senior unsecured convertible notes rating from baa to ba moody s also assigned our company a first time senior implied rating of ba both moody s and s p attached a negative outlook to their ratings 
the downgrades do not have any immediate material impact on our liquidity as we do not have any outstanding credit facilities nor do we anticipate any third party funding needs in the near future 
there are no financial covenants related to our senior unsecured convertible notes 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and other financing capabilities will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital  capital expenditure and other liquidity needs for off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  we enter into contractual commitments to purchase materials and components from suppliers in exchange for favorable pricing or more beneficial terms 
these non cancelable purchase obligations for materials were not material as of october  
table of contents 
index to financial statements risks  uncertainties and other factors that may affect future results our operating results and financial condition could be harmed if the industries into which we sell our products  remain depressed or do not continue to recover 
the economic downturn resulted in reduced purchasing in many of the markets that we serve worldwide 
the communications industry  especially wireline communications  remains in a downward cycle characterized by diminished product demand  excess manufacturing capacity and the increasing erosion of average selling prices 
recently several segments of the semiconductor and electronics industries stabilized and demonstrated growth in the most recent quarter 
however  the sustainability of this market recovery during the next year is uncertain and demand in our markets remains volatile so the underlying trend is uncertain 
pricing pressures and competition remain intense  which could reduce our gross margins and could require us to implement additional cost cutting measures to sustain profitability 
visibility into our markets is limited 
any decline in our customers markets or in general economic conditions would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and services 
in addition  if our customers markets decline  we may not be able to collect on outstanding amounts due to us 
such decline could harm our consolidated financial position  results of operations  cash flows and stock price  and could limit our ability to reach our goals for sustaining profitability 
also  in such an environment  pricing pressures could intensify  and if we were unable to respond quickly enough this could further reduce our gross margins 
finally  we may be required to secure additional debt or equity financing at some time in the future  and we cannot assure you that such financing will be available on acceptable terms when required 
in particular  on february   standard and poor s ratings services lowered its corporate credit and senior note ratings for us to speculative grade status  from bbb minus to bb  with a negative rating outlook and on may   moody s investor service downgraded our senior unsecured convertible notes rating from baa to ba and assigned us a first time senior implied rating of ba  with a negative rating outlook 
if these ratings are not upgraded or are further downgraded  we would be required to pay a higher interest rate for future borrowing needs and we may have stricter terms 
the actions we took in response to the reduced demand for our products and services could have long term adverse effects on our business 
beginning in the third quarter of  our revenue started declining 
to scale back our operations and to reduce our expenses in response to this decreased demand for our products and services and lower revenue  we reduced our workforce  froze hiring  cut back significantly on our use of temporary workers and reduced discretionary spending 
we also initiated short term facility closures to reduce production levels 
in calendar year  we announced plans to reduce our workforce by approximately  people 
this reduction was substantially completed at the end of the fourth quarter of in august  we announced approximately  additional job cuts and in february another  which are substantially complete 
about  employees left the company in fiscal year  including approximately  in the fourth quarter  which numbers include workforce reductions  attrition  divestitures and other departures 
there are several risks inherent in our efforts to transition to a reduced cost structure 
these include the risk that we will not be able to reduce expenditures quickly enough and hold them at a level necessary to sustain profitability  and that we may have to undertake further restructuring initiatives that would entail additional charges 
for example  prior to the third quarter of  we had not anticipated the necessity for the further restructuring initiatives to reduce costs by another million per quarter  nor did we anticipate prior to the first quarter of that we would need 
table of contents 
index to financial statements to expand our restructuring measures to reduce costs by an additional million per quarter 
in addition  our delay in restructuring savings  especially in our non people related costs  adversely affected our results for the second quarter of if we are not able to reduce our non people related costs in accordance with our previous plans  we may have to further reduce our workforce 
there is also the risk that cost cutting initiatives will impair our ability to effectively develop and market products  to remain competitive in the industries in which we compete and to operate effectively 
each of the above measures could have long term effects on our business by reducing our pool of technical talent  decreasing or slowing improvements in our products  making it more difficult for us to respond to customers  limiting our ability to increase production quickly if and when the demand for our products increases and limiting our ability to hire and retain key personnel 
these circumstances could cause our income to be lower than they otherwise might be 
failure to adjust our purchases due to changing market conditions or failure to estimate our customers demand could adversely affect our income 
our income could be harmed if we are unable to adjust our purchases to market fluctuations  including those caused by the seasonal or cyclical nature of the markets in which we operate 
the sales of our products and services are dependent  to a large degree  on customers whose industries are subject to cyclical trends in the demand for their products 
during a market upturn  our results could be materially and adversely impacted if we cannot increase our purchases of supplies or components parts quickly enough to meet increasing demand for our products 
in addition  some of the parts that require custom design are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work 
should a supplier cease manufacture of such a component  we would be forced to reengineer our product 
in addition to discontinuing parts  suppliers may also extend lead times  limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors 
by contrast  in order to secure components for the production of products  we may continue to enter into non cancelable purchase commitments with vendors  or at times make advance payments to suppliers  which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to declining market demands 
prior commitments of this type have resulted in an excess of parts as demand for our communications  semiconductor and electronics products has decreased 
for example  in the year ended october   we incurred approximately million of inventory related charges  and in the twelve months ended october   we incurred approximately another million in inventory related charges 
if demand for our products is less than we expect  we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges 
we are continuing to implement new information systems  and problems with the design or implementation of these new systems have interfered and could further interfere with our operations 
we are in the process of implementing new information systems to eventually replace our current systems  which are largely based on legacy systems that were created when we were a part of hewlett packard 
as a part of this effort  we are implementing new enterprise resource planning software and other software applications to manage our business operations 
we may not be successful in implementing these new systems and transitioning data 
for example  following the first phase of our enterprise resource planning software implementation  we experienced difficulties in providing customer quotes and in acknowledging and shipping customer orders 
although we believe that we have identified  to a large extent  the problems associated with the implementation and that the system is now stabilizing  new problems could arise that we have not foreseen 
during  we plan to continue implementation at additional sites 
as we continue our implementation and add additional functionality  our operations could be further disrupted 
such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to do the following in a timely manner provide quotes  take customer 
table of contents 
index to financial statements orders  ship products  provide services and support to our customers  bill and track our customers  fulfill contractual obligations and otherwise run our business 
as a result  our financial position  results of operations  cash flows and stock price could be adversely affected 
in addition  our future revenue and profit projections could be inaccurate if we have misjudged the realization of potential future savings from the new systems 
fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may cause volatility in the price of our common stock and the senior convertible debentures 
given the nature of the markets in which we participate  we cannot reliably predict future revenue and profitability 
our quarterly sales and operating results have become highly dependent on the volume and timing of orders received during the quarter  which are difficult to forecast 
these results are also dependent on the seasonal and cyclical nature of our end markets such as consumer electronics  including cell phones 
for example  throughout  the continued low levels of orders significantly affected our ability to efficiently plan production and inventory levels  which led to fluctuations in operating results 
in addition  a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to our significant sales  research and development and manufacturing costs 
if we cannot adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for a revenue shortfall  this may magnify the adverse impact of such revenue shortfall on our results of operations 
fluctuations in our operating results may cause volatility in the price of our common stock and the debentures 
our income may suffer if demand does not match our manufacturing capacity 
because we cannot immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to rapidly changing market conditions  when demand does not meet our expectations  our manufacturing capacity will likely exceed our production requirements 
currently  we have excess manufacturing capacity as a result of the decrease in purchasing and capital spending in the communications  electronics and semiconductor industries 
the fixed costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity have adversely affected  and may continue to adversely affect  our income 
conversely  if during a general market upturn or an upturn in one of our segments  we cannot increase our manufacturing capacity to meet product demand  we will not be able to fulfill orders in a timely manner 
if we do not introduce successful new products and services in a timely manner  our products and services will become obsolete  and our operating results will suffer 
we generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes  frequent new product and service introductions and changing industry standards 
in addition  many of the markets in which we operate are seasonal and cyclical 
without the timely introduction of new products  services and enhancements  our products and services will become technologically obsolete over time  in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer 
the success of our new product and service offerings will depend on several factors  including our ability to properly identify customer needs  innovate and develop new technologies  services and applications  successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner  manufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes on time  differentiate our offerings from our competitors offerings  price our products competitively  and 
table of contents 
index to financial statements anticipate our competitors development of new products  services or technological innovations 
dependence on outsourced manufacturing may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and damage our reputation and dependence on outsourced information technology function may impair our ability to operate effectively 
as part of efforts to streamline operations and to cut costs  we have been outsourcing and will continue to evaluate additional outsourcing of manufacturing  mostly lower level assemblies and sub assemblies 
if our third party manufacturers fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels  our ability to bring products to market and our reputation could suffer 
the ability of these manufacturers to perform is largely outside of our control 
in addition  we outsourced significant portions of our information technology function 
since information technology is critical to our operations  any failure to perform on the part of third party contractors could impair our ability to operate effectively 
much of our outsourcing takes place in developing countries  and as a result may be subject to geopolitical uncertainty 
economic  political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations 
because we sell our products worldwide  our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally 
we anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total revenue 
in addition  many of our manufacturing facilities and suppliers are located outside the us accordingly  our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors  including interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers  changes in foreign currency exchange rates  changes in a specific country s or region s political  economic or other conditions  trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements  negative consequences from changes in tax laws  difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations  differing labor regulations  differing protection of intellectual property  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  and geopolitical turmoil  including terrorism and war 
we are in the process of centralizing most of our accounting processes to two locations malaysia and india 
these processes include general accounting  accounts payable and accounts receivables functions 
if conditions change in those countries  it may adversely affect operations  including impairing our ability to pay our suppliers and collect our receivables 
our results of operations  as well as our liquidity  may be adversely affected and possible delays may occur in reporting financial results 
if we are required to account for options under our employee stock plans as a compensation expense  our net income and net income per share would be significantly reduced 
there has been an increasing public debate about the proper accounting treatment for employee stock options 
currently we would record compensation expense only in connection with option 
table of contents 
index to financial statements grants that have an exercise price below fair market value 
for option grants that have an exercise price at fair market value we calculate compensation expense and disclose the impact on net loss income and net loss income per share in a footnote to the consolidated financial statements 
it is possible that future laws and regulations will require us to estimate and record the fair market value of all stock options as compensation expense in our consolidated statement of operations 
our business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel 
our future success depends partly on the continued service of our key research  engineering  sales  marketing  manufacturing  executive and administrative personnel 
if we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel  we will not be able to maintain or expand our business 
since  we have experienced temporary pay reductions  workforce reductions and limited pay increases  which may harm our long term ability to retain and hire key personnel 
although the labor market has changed dramatically within the past two years  and our attrition rate has remained low  there is still intense competition for certain highly technical specialties in geographic areas where we continue to recruit 
if sales of custom integrated circuits to hewlett packard continue to decline  our semiconductor products revenue will suffer  and we are limited in our ability to sell these integrated circuits to other companies 
historically  our semiconductor products business has sold custom products to hewlett packard and has engaged in product development efforts with divisions of hewlett packard 
we have a license agreement with hewlett packard that covers integrated circuit technology used in custom integrated circuits for hewlett packard s printers  scanners and computers 
the license agreement provides that  until november in some cases  we are prohibited  with some exceptions  from using this integrated circuit technology for the development and sale of integrated circuits for use in inkjet products  printer products including printer supplies  accessories and components  document scanners and computing products to third parties other than hewlett packard 
although we have entered into a supply agreement for the sale to hewlett packard of custom integrated circuits used in printers  scanners and computers  the agreement does not require hewlett packard to purchase a minimum amount of product from us 
as hewlett packard reduces its purchases of our custom integrated circuits  we are unable to address this reduction through sales of these kinds of integrated circuits for these types of products to other customers 
our custom integrated circuit sales to hewlett packard declined by percent and percent in the twelve and three months ended october   respectively 
environmental contamination from past operations could subject us to unreimbursed costs and could harm on site operations and the future use and value of the properties involved and environmental contamination caused by ongoing operations could subject us to substantial liabilities in the future 
some of our properties are undergoing remediation by hewlett packard for subsurface contaminations that were known at the time of our separation from hewlett packard 
hewlett packard has agreed to retain the liability for this subsurface contamination  perform the required remediation and indemnify us with respect to claims arising out of that contamination 
the determination of the existence and cost of any additional contamination caused by us could involve costly and time consuming negotiations and litigation 
in addition  hewlett packard will have access to our properties to perform remediation 
while hewlett packard has agreed to minimize interference with on site operations at those properties  remediation activities and subsurface contamination may require us to incur unreimbursed costs and could harm on site operations and 
table of contents 
index to financial statements the future use and value of the properties 
we cannot be sure that hewlett packard will continue to fulfill its indemnification or remediation obligations 
we have agreed to indemnify hewlett packard for any liability associated with contamination from past operations at all other properties transferred from hewlett packard to us other than those properties currently undergoing remediation by hewlett packard 
while we are not aware of any material liabilities associated with any potential subsurface contamination at any of those properties  subsurface contamination may exist  and we may be exposed to material liability as a result of the existence of that contamination 
our semiconductor and other manufacturing processes involve the use of substances regulated under various international  federal  state and local laws governing the environment 
we may be subject to liabilities for environmental contamination  and these liabilities may be substantial 
although our policy is to apply strict standards for environmental protection at our sites inside and outside the us  even if the sites outside the us are not subject to regulations imposed by foreign governments  we may not be aware of all conditions that could subject us to liability 
our customers and we are subject to various governmental regulations  compliance with which may cause us to incur significant expenses  and if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain regulations  we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution  and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties 
our businesses are subject to various significant international  federal  state and local regulations  including but not limited to health and safety  packaging  product content  labor and import export regulations 
these regulations are complex  change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time 
we may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations or to remedy violations of these regulations 
any failure by us to comply with applicable government regulations could also result in cessation of our operations or portions of our operations  product recalls or impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations 
in addition  because many of our products are regulated or sold into regulated industries  we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products 
our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies  like the international standards organization  as well as regulation by other agencies such as the us federal communications commission 
we also must comply with work safety rules 
if we fail to adequately address any of these regulations  our businesses could be harmed 
some of our chemical analysis products are used in conjunction with chemicals whose manufacture  processing  distribution and notification requirements are regulated by the us environmental protection agency under the toxic substances control act  and by regulatory bodies in other countries with laws similar to the toxic substances control act 
we must conform the manufacture  processing  distribution of and notification about these chemicals to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in all countries as these requirements change 
if we fail to comply with these requirements in the manufacture or distribution of our products  then we could be made to pay civil penalties  face criminal prosecution and  in some cases  be prohibited from distributing our products in commerce until the products or component substances are brought into compliance 
we are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts  and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers 
we have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and  as a result  we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the

the laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts 
for example  many government contracts contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts 
we are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts 
a failure to comply with these regulations might result in suspension of these contracts  or administrative penalties 
third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property  and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products 
while we do not believe that any of our products infringe the valid intellectual property rights of third parties  we may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of our technology  products or services 
any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time consuming and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations 
the complexity of the technology involved and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation increase these risks 
claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly license agreements 
however  we may not be able to obtain license agreements on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
we also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of certain of our products 
we often rely on licenses of intellectual property useful for our businesses 
we cannot ensure that these licenses will be available in the future on favorable terms or at all 
in addition  our position with respect to the negotiation of licenses has changed as a result of our separation from hewlett packard 
in the past  as a part of hewlett packard  we benefited from our access to hewlett packard s entire intellectual property portfolio when asserting counterclaims and negotiating cross licenses with third parties 
our current patent cross license agreement with hewlett packard gives us only a limited ability to sublicense a portion of hewlett packard s intellectual property portfolio 
accordingly  we may be unable to obtain agreements on terms as favorable as we may have been able to obtain if we could have sublicensed hewlett packard s entire intellectual property portfolio 
nothing restricts hewlett packard from competing with us other than some restrictions on the use of patents licensed to hewlett packard by us 
third parties may infringe our intellectual property  and we may expend significant resources enforcing our rights or suffer competitive injury 
our success depends in large part on our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secrets  confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
if we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights  our competitive position could suffer  which could harm our operating results 
our pending patent and trademark registration applications may not be allowed  or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents  copyrights or trademarks 
in addition  our patents may not provide us a significant competitive advantage 
we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and police our intellectual property rights 
we may not be able to detect infringement and our competitive position may be harmed before we do so 
in addition  competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies 
intellectual property rights may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries  which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share 
furthermore  some intellectual property rights are licensed to other companies  allowing them to compete with us using that intellectual property

index to financial statements our acquisitions  strategic alliances  joint ventures and divestitures may result in financial results that are different than expected 
in the normal course of business  we frequently engage in discussions with third parties relating to possible acquisitions  strategic alliances  joint ventures and divestitures 
as a result of such transactions  our financial results may differ from the investment community s expectations in a given quarter 
in addition  acquisitions and strategic alliances may require us to integrate a different company culture  management team and business infrastructure 
we may have difficulty developing  manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a way that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines to realize the value from expected synergies 
depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition  our successful integration of the entity depends on a variety of factors  including the retention of key employees  the management of facilities and employees in different geographic areas  the retention of key customers  and the integration or coordination of different research and development  product manufacturing and sales programs and facilities 
a successful divestiture depends on various factors  including our ability to effectively transfer liabilities  contracts  facilities and employees to the purchaser  identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to keep  and reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business 
any additional impairment of the value of purchased assets and goodwill could have a significant negative impact on our future operating results 
in addition  if customers of the divested business do not receive the same level of service from the new owners  this may adversely affect our other businesses to the extent that these customers also purchase other agilent products 
all of these efforts require varying levels of management resources  which may divert our attention from other business operations 
further  if market conditions or other factors lead us to change our strategic direction  we may not realize the expected value from such transactions 
if we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of such transactions  our consolidated financial position  results of operations  cash flows and stock price could be negatively impacted 
if we suffer loss to our factories  facilities or distribution system due to catastrophe  our operations could be seriously harmed 
our factories  facilities and distribution system are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire  flood  terrorism or other natural or man made disasters 
in particular  several of our facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquake due to their locations 
our production facilities  headquarters and agilent technologies laboratories in california  and our production facilities in washington and japan  are all located in areas with above average seismic activity 
if any of these facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss  it could disrupt our operations  delay production  shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility 
although we carry insurance for property damage and business interruption  we do not carry insurance or financial reserves for interruptions or potential losses arising from earthquakes or terrorism

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our sales commitments  anticipated sales  and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries 
we hedge future cash flows denominated in currencies other than the functional currency using sales forecasts up to twelve months in advance 
our exposure to exchange rate risks is managed on an enterprise wide basis 
this strategy utilizes derivative financial instruments  including option and forward contracts  to hedge foreign currency exposures with the intent of offsetting gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and losses on the derivative contracts hedging them 
we do not currently and do not intend to utilize derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
our operations generate non functional currency cash flows such as revenues  third party vendor payments and inter company payments 
in anticipation of these foreign currency cash flows and in view of volatility of the currency market  we enter into such foreign exchange contracts as are described above to manage our currency risk 
approximately percent of our revenues in and percent of our revenues in and percent of our revenues in were generated in us dollars 
we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical percent adverse movement in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above 
as of october  and october   the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows
