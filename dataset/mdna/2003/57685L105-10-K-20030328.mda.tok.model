item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview in fiscal we undertook a significant change in our strategic plan and related business operations by exiting the chewing gum business and refocusing entirely on the development  production and sale of over the counter pharmaceutical products 
in july  we sold substantially all of our assets and business related to our chewing gum operations to wrigley 
in december  we acquired the remaining of gel tech  making it a wholly owned subsidiary of matrixx 
in july  the name of gel tech  llc was changed to zicam  llc 
our financial results reflect our former chewing gum operations as discontinued operations  and consequently these operations are not reflected in the following discussion and analysis 
we report zicam  llc s financial results on a consolidated basis 
we owned of zicam prior to december  and on and subsequent to that date 
our restructuring process continued in as we reincorporated in delaware  changed our name to matrixx initiatives  inc and consolidated our operations in our phoenix office 
moreover  as part of our focus on over the counter pharmaceutical products  we introduced five new zicam nasal gel products during the year  improved package graphics for the entire zicam product line and engaged a new sales team to represent our products to retailers 
earnings in future periods will be significantly affected by the level of sales  and the timing and amount of our advertising and research and development expenses 
expenditures for advertising and research and development will vary by quarter throughout the year and could be significantly different from amounts in the same periods in earlier years 
for  we anticipate spending substantially more for both of these items in the first quarter  compared to the first quarter of results of operations for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  certain information is set forth below for our operations expressed in dollars and as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated years ended december  net sales   cost of sales   gross profit   operating expenses   research and development income loss from operations  interest and other income net interest expense income loss from continuing operations before income tax and minority interest   net sales net sales for increased to approximately million  or above the sales level 
approximately one third of the million increase in net sales is attributable to increases in sales of zicam cold remedy and allergy relief  and the remaining two thirds to sales of the five new zicam products introduced in late sales of zicam cold remedy and allergy relief increased due primarily to increased sales to end use customers  and additionally  with respect to sales of the cold remedy product  to the addition of sales to two major club warehouse outlets 
we introduced five new zicam products in the third quarter of cold remedy swabs  cold remedy swabs kids size  extreme congestion relief  sinus relief and nasal moisturizer 
although we are generally pleased with the retail and consumer acceptance of these new products  the retail distribution has yet to achieve levels comparable to our original zicam products 
our principal sales focus is to secure additional retail acceptance  particularly among the major national drug  food and mass market retailers of all five of these new products 
the swab products have been in a back order situation due to the inability of our supplier to increase production  and to higher than expected demand for the adult swab product 
we estimate the swab back order at the end of to be greater than million in net sales 
we expect the back order to continue until the end of the current cold season late march or early april when the normal seasonal reduction in demand from customers will allow us to build inventory of the swab products 
we are evaluating a variety of options to ensure that we avoid a similar shortfall in the upcoming cold season 
we plan to build an inventory of the swab products in coming months  which we were unable to do prior to the current cold season due to our introduction of these products late in we cannot be certain that our supplier will be able to produce the amount of inventory that we are seeking to acquire before the commencement of the next cough and cold season 
even if we are able to acquire this inventory  it is possible that another backlog could occur in the next season as a result of unanticipated factors  including higher than expected product demand 
we expect sales increases in future periods from continued  albeit lower  growth rates for our original zicam cold remedy and zicam allergy relief products  and from increased sales of our five new products due to increased retail distribution  greater customer acceptance and the planned elimination of the swab product back order 
we plan on introducing additional products in late which we believe will further add to our sales increases 
cost of sales the cost of sales for increased approximately million or over the increase was primarily due to a increase in unit sales 
the higher per unit cost of the swab products and premium production cost associated with the two swab products contributed to the increase in cost of sales 
a decrease in manufacturing costs of zicam cold remedy and zicam allergy relief partially offset this increase from the swab products 
our current pricing with our swab product supplier  ist  is fixed by contract until the end of fiscal  at which time we will be required to review and negotiate new pricing terms 
in the first quarter of  ist advised us of an increase in pricing for the balance of we have advised ist of our opposition to this pricing increase on the basis that it is not permitted by our contract  and we are presently examining options to resolve this issue 
in order to prevent a suspension in swab production while this issue is being dealt with  we may elect to pay this increased pricing under protest 
if we are forced to accept this increased pricing  our cost of sales will increase and our results of operations for will be negatively impacted 
assuming we are able to negotiate a new supply contract with ist at the end of  we expect that this new contract may provide for higher product costs than those provided for under our current contract with ist 
we cannot be certain  however  that we will be able to agree with ist on terms for a new contract  nor can we determine at this time what the increased costs in any new contract would entail 
gross profit gross profit for increased to approximately million  or above the level  due to the higher sales level 
offsetting the higher sales was the higher unit cost of sales  primarily due to the new swab products  which is reflected in a decrease in gross profit percentage of sales to in from in operating expenses operating expenses decreased from approximately million in to million in the decrease is largely due to the settlement and legal expenses of million that we incurred in related to a patent infringement lawsuit filed against the company by the quigley corporation 
our royalty obligations to quigley  which formed part of the settlement  ended in march a decrease in advertising and public relations expenses of approximately million between the two years also contributed to our lower operating expenses in offsetting these decreases were increased sales commission expense of  related to the higher level of sales  an increase of quality control expenses primarily due to the new product analysis  an increase in total labor expense of  higher rent expense of  reflecting a full year at our new corporate office location and higher depreciation and amortization of  we believe that expense levels in future periods will be primarily affected by the timing and amount of advertising expenses and costs associated with new product introductions 
research and development research and development expense amounted to  for  reflecting costs associated with the five new zicam products that were introduced in the year 
expenses in primarily reflect costs associated with our nicotine gum development which we undertook in conjunction with swedish match ab swedish match 
this development was terminated in the third quarter of following our exit from the gum business 
we expect to increase our research and development expenses significantly in to approximately of net sales as we undertake further work on our zicam products  including additional product line extensions  and explore other product opportunities 
interest and other income net interest and other income for amounted to approximately  or approximately  above approximately  of the amount is royalty income and the remainder is largely interest income on our invested cash 
virtually all of the income was interest income reduced by a  write down of an investment in a company that matrixx had evaluated and rejected as a possible acquisition candidate 
our interest income is largely due to the company s invested cash position arising from the sale of our gum business in july to wrigley  reduced in by payments made in conjunction with our acquisition of the remaining interest in zicam  llc 
royalty income is from a dental gum product sold by wrigley 
we entered into the royalty agreement with wrigley in conjunction with the sale of our gum assets in july we are unable to predict the success or future sales of the wrigley gum product  and therefore  cannot estimate the amount or timing of any future royalty payments 
interest expense interest expense increased to approximately  for from approximately  in the increase is entirely attributable to imputed interest accrued under the note that we issued to zensano  inc now zengen  inc in connection with our acquisition of zensano s interest in zicam  llc in december two additional payments of million each are due under the note in late june and late november income loss from continuing operations before income tax and minority interest our income before income taxes and minority interest in was approximately million  an increase of more than million from the net loss of million reported for the increase is due to a higher gross profit resulting from higher net sales and a decrease in operating expenses 
we expect that earnings in future periods will be significantly impacted by the success of our seven current products  new product introductions including new products that we plan to introduce in and year over year changes in our advertising and research and development budgets 
provision for income tax expense due to the income we recorded in and our expectation of net income in future periods  we concluded that  more likely than not  we will be able to utilize the accumulated tax loss carry forward that had been generated in prior years but not reflected as an asset 
based on this determination  we recorded a decrease in the provision for income taxes of almost million in income tax expense was further reduced in the period by an income tax refund of approximately  related to a change in tax laws in results of operations for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  certain information is set forth below for our operations expressed in dollars and as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated years ended december  net sales   cost of sales   gross profit   operating expenses   research and development income loss from operations   interest and other income net interest expense income loss from continuing operations before income tax and minority interest   net sales for  net sales of zicam cold remedy and zicam allergy relief increased to million or approximately above the level 
unit sales of zicam cold remedy in increased more than over the prior year due primarily to increased sales to end use consumers due to increased consumer awareness of the product and the introduction in of a twin pack cold remedy product  which was well received in the marketplace 
sales of zicam cold remedy accounted for approximately of net sales in the sales comparison to is also affected by relatively low sales in due to a high level of inventory held by retailers at the start of the cold season as a result of initial purchases made in connection with introduction of the product in the prior year 
zicam allergy relief was introduced in march unit sales of zicam allergy relief increased more than in over the prior year due to increased sales to end use customers and a greater level of retail distribution 
cost of sales cost of sales increased in from the prior year by approximately  reflecting the higher level of sales  but decreased as a percentage of sales from in to in due to higher freight costs experienced in early during the introduction of zicam cold remedy and a decrease in manufacturing costs in gross profit gross profit increased from million in to million in as a result of the higher sales level and decreases in the cost of sales 
operating expenses operating expenses increased from million in to million in due to the amount of the settlement that we paid and legal expenses that we incurred in connection with the quigley corporation s lawsuit against the company 
the combined settlement amount and expenses amounted to nearly million 
that increase was partially offset by a small decrease in marketing expenses between the two periods 
research and development the increase in research and development expense in was attributable to costs associated with our nicotine gum project that were incurred subsequent to the termination of our joint venture with swedish match 
after termination of the joint venture  swedish match no longer reimbursed us for research and development expenses related to nicotine gum 
we terminated the nicotine gum project in the third quarter of interest and other income net interest and other income principally reflects interest income on our cash investments 
we invested our cash  which increased significantly as a result of receipt of the proceeds from the sale of substantially all of our chewing gum business assets and  shares of our common stock to wrigley in july  in relatively low yielding us treasury securities 
offsetting this income in  was a write down in the amount of  for an investment in a company that matrixx had evaluated and rejected as a possible acquisition candidate 
interest expense interest expense decreased from  in to  in due to our repayment in early of debt and lease financings 
income loss from continuing operations before income tax and minority interest the loss from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interest improved in by approximately million over due to the higher sales levels  offset in part by the higher expenses resulting from the quigley lawsuit 
liquidity and capital resources our working capital decreased million to approximately million at december  from approximately million at december   due primarily to the reclassification of our million note obligations incurred in connection with our acquisition of the remaining of zicam  llc 
from long term debt to current debt 
the impact of this reclassification on working capital was offset by our profitability in and the recognition of a current deferred tax asset 
during  we experienced an increase in cash from operations of  due to an increase in net income of million net of deferred income tax expense  a decrease in restricted cash of million  amortization of interest on notes payable of million and other non cash charges to income of million 
these increases to cash were offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million and a decrease in accounts payable of million 
investing activities provided cash of approximately million due largely to the maturity of marketable securities that were reinvested in securities that are classified as cash equivalents of million  offset in part by capital expenditures of approximately million for a new corporate information system 
cash flows from financing activities used million of cash due to our payments of million to zengen  inc under the above described note  and the repayment in february of borrowings under our million bank credit facility 
we expanded our bank credit arrangement in may with comerica bank california to provide for an increase in our direct borrowing capacity to million with more favorable borrowing rates and terms 
we do not currently have any borrowings outstanding under the facility and  due to our cash position  do not anticipate borrowing under the facility to meet our immediate working capital requirements 
we are in compliance with the earnings and financial covenants contained in our credit agreement 
we believe that our existing capital resources and our credit line are sufficient to fund our operations and capital requirements for the next twelve months 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements 
in general  management s estimates are based on historical experience  on information from third party professionals and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates made by management 
we believe that our critical accounting policies and estimates include the accounting for intangible assets and goodwill  accounting for income taxes  and accounting for returns and allowances associated with our products 
intangible assets and goodwill we recorded approximately million in goodwill in connection with the zicam  llc interest that we acquired from zensano  inc in december under sfas  goodwill must be tested annually to identify a potential impairment and the amount of any impairment loss 
factors that could affect this analysis would be significant loss of market share  a general decline in zicam product sales  higher than expected increases in expenses and various other matters 
any change in key assumptions about the business or prospects of zicam  llc  or any change in market conditions or other externalities affecting zicam  llc  could result in an impairment charge  and such a charge could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
accounting for income taxes due to our significant operating losses prior to  we possess a sizeable tax loss carry forward which can be used to reduce our taxable income in future periods 
due to our history of operating losses  we recorded a deferred tax valuation allowance in and prior years to offset the entire deferred tax asset arising from our tax loss carry forward 
however  due to the significant improvement in our net income in  together with our expectation of continuing profitability in future years  we have determined that we are more likely than not to realize the tax benefit associated with our tax loss carry forward 
consequently  we reduced the deferred tax valuation allowance and recorded a large portion of the deferred tax asset in the effect of this change was a decrease in our income tax expense of approximately million in in future periods  we will record income tax expense based on our estimated effective income tax rate for each period 
in addition  we will continue to evaluate the deferred tax valuation allowance regularly and adjust the amount to reflect our expectation of our ability to realize the tax benefit arising from our tax loss carry forward on a quarterly basis 
should there be a significant change in our expectations of future income  the impact of adjusting the deferred tax valuation allowance could be significant which would negatively impact our earnings 
accounting for customer returns and allowances 
we recognize revenues on the sale of our products when they are shipped from our warehouse facility  and at that time record a provision for estimated product returns 
the estimate for product returns is based on our historical experience of sales to retailers and is reviewed regularly to ensure that it reflects the liability associated with product returns 
to date  our sales returns experience has been consistent with our estimate for returns  except for returns of outdated products arising from excessive production during the introduction of zicam cold remedy in the cold season 
currently  we are recording a provision of of gross sales for our original zicam cold remedy and zicam allergy relief products for potential returns and allowances 
in establishing the appropriate reserve level for the five new zicam products introduced in the third quarter of  we reviewed the similarities and differences of the five products relative to zicam cold remedy and zicam allergy relief for which we now have almost three years of product return experience 
based on that review  we are recording a provision of gross sales for these products 
we will review the return provision regularly and adjust these reserve amounts as actual product return experience continues to develop 
should the actual level of product returns vary significantly from our estimates  our operating and financial results would be materially affected 
in addition  we expect that a higher sales returns allowance will be recorded in the future for any other new products that we introduce until such products achieve market acceptance

risk factors our new business focus means we have a limited operating history on which to assess our current and prospective performance although we have been in operations for a number of years  the significant change of direction and focus in our business that we made in by exiting the chewing gum business and refocusing entirely on the development  production and sale of over the counter pharmaceutical products presents a limited operating history upon which you may evaluate our current and prospective performance 
the possibility of our future success must be considered relative to the problems  challenges  complications and delays frequently encountered in connection with the development and operation of a new business  and the development and marketing of relatively new products such as the zicam products 
if our zicam products do not gain widespread market acceptance  our anticipated sales and results of operations will suffer although studies have indicated that zicam cold remedy can significantly reduce the duration and severity of the common cold  we cannot be certain that this product including our new swab formats will achieve widespread acceptance by the market 
to date  zicam allergy relief has not achieved the market success presently enjoyed by zicam cold remedy 
in addition  given their recent introduction in late  our five new zicam products have not yet reached the level of market recognition achieved by the original zicam cold remedy 
while we are working to increase the market presence of zicam allergy relief and our five new zicam products  we cannot be certain that demand for these products will grow 
if any unanticipated problem arises concerning the efficacy of zicam cold remedy  zicam allergy relief or any of our other new products  or if any of these products fails to achieve widespread market acceptance for any other reason  our operating results and prospects would be materially adversely affected 
unanticipated problems associated with product development and commercialization could adversely affect our operating results our successful development of existing and new products is subject to the risks of failure and delay inherent in the development and commercialization of products based on innovative technologies 
these risks include the possibilities that we may experience unanticipated or otherwise negative research and development results  existing or proposed products may be found to be ineffective or unsafe  or may otherwise fail to receive required regulatory clearances or approvals  we may find that existing or proposed products  while effective  are uneconomical to commercialize or market  we may be unable to produce sufficient product inventories to meet customer demand  existing or proposed products do not achieve broad market acceptance  or proprietary rights held by third parties preclude us from developing or marketing existing or proposed products 
our inability to develop and commercialize our existing products or any new products on a timely basis and within our financial budgets could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and future prospects 
our inability to provide scientific proof for product claims may adversely affect our sales the marketing of our zicam products involves claims that these products assist in reducing the duration and severity of the common cold in the case of zicam cold remedy and the related zicam swab products and controlling allergy symptoms in the case of zicam allergy relief 
under fda and ftc rules  we are required to obtain scientific data to support any health claims we make concerning our products 
although we have neither provided nor been requested to provide any scientific data to the fda in support of claims regarding our zicam products  we have obtained scientific data for all of our products 
we cannot be certain  however  that the scientific data we have obtained in support of our claims will be deemed acceptable to the fda or ftc  should either agency request any such data in the future 
if the fda or the ftc requests any supporting information  and we are unable to provide support that is acceptable to the fda or the ftc  either agency could force us to stop making the claims in question or restrict us from selling the affected products 
fda and other government regulation may restrict our ability to sell our products we are subject to various federal  state and local laws and regulations affecting our business 
our zicam products are subject to regulation by the fda  including regulations with respect to labeling of products  approval of ingredients in products  claims made regarding the products  and disclosure of product ingredients 
if we do not comply with these regulations  the fda could force us to stop selling the affected products or require us to incur substantial costs in adopting measures to maintain compliance with these regulations 
our advertising claims regarding our products are subject to the jurisdiction of the ftc as well as the fda 
in both cases we are required to obtain scientific data to support any advertising or labeling health claims we make concerning our products  although no pre clearance or filing is required to be made with either agency 
if we are unable to provide the required support for such claims  the ftc may stop us from making such claims or require us to stop selling the affected products 
we may fail to compete effectively  particularly against larger  more established pharmaceutical and health products companies  causing our business and operating results to suffer the consumer health products industry is highly competitive 
we compete with companies in the united states and abroad that are engaged in the development of both traditional and innovative healthcare products 
many of these companies have much greater financial and technical resources and production and marketing capabilities than we do 
as well  many of these companies have already achieved significant product acceptance and brand recognition with respect to products that compete directly with our zicam products 
our competitors may successfully develop and market superior or less expensive products which could render our zicam and other future products less valuable or unmarketable 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property or if we infringe the intellectual property of others  our financial condition and future prospects could be materially harmed we rely significantly on the protections afforded by patent and trademark registrations that we routinely seek from the us patent and trademark office uspto and from similar agencies in foreign countries 
we cannot be certain that any patent or trademark application that we file will be approved by the uspto or other foreign agencies 
in addition  we cannot be certain that we will be able to successfully defend any trademark  trade name or patent that we hold against claims from  or use by  competitors or other third parties 
no consistent policy has emerged from the uspto or the courts regarding the breadth of claims allowed or the degree of protection afforded under biotechnology and similar patents 
our future success will depend on our ability to prevent others from infringing on our proprietary rights  as well as our ability to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others 
we may be required at times to take legal action to protect our proprietary rights and  despite our best efforts  we may be sued for infringing on the patent rights of others 
patent litigation is costly and  even if we prevail  the cost of such litigation could adversely affect our financial condition 
if we do not prevail  in addition to any damages we might have to pay  we could be required to stop the infringing activity or obtain a license 
we cannot be certain that any required license would be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we fail to obtain a license  our business might be materially adversely affected 
in addition to seeking patent protection  we rely upon a combination of non disclosure agreements  other contractual restrictions and trade secrecy laws to protect proprietary information 
there can be no assurance that these steps will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information or that our competitors will not independently develop technology or trade secrets that compete with our proprietary information 
we may incur significant costs resulting from product liability claims we are subject to significant liability should use or consumption of our products cause injury  illness or death 
although we carry product liability insurance  there can be no assurance that our insurance will be adequate to protect us against product liability claims or that insurance coverage will continue to be available on reasonable terms 
a product liability claim  even one without merit or for which we have substantial coverage  could result in significant legal defense costs  thereby increasing our expenses and lowering our earnings 
such a claim  whether or not proven to be valid  could have a material adverse effect on our product branding and goodwill  resulting in reduced market acceptance of our products 
this in turn could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we do not have manufacturing capabilities of our own we currently do not have the physical or human resources to independently manufacture our zicam products or any other products that we may develop 
we currently outsource all of our product manufacturing and packaging operations and intend to continue this outsourcing for the foreseeable future 
if we are unable to enter into cost effective or otherwise suitable arrangements for manufacturing of our zicam products or any other products  or if our third party contractors fail to adequately perform their manufacturing operations as has occurred to date with our new swab products  our sales and related financial results could be materially adversely affected 
if  in the future  we decide to establish our own manufacturing facilities  we will require substantial additional funds and significant additional personnel to undertake such operations 
we cannot be certain that such funding or a sufficient number of such qualified persons will be available for such an undertaking 
we may continue to experience product backlogs at the end of  we had approximately million in backlog of swab orders 
we expect this backlog to continue until the end of the current cold season in late march or early april while we have plans in place to build up our swab product inventory at the end of the current cold season in order to prevent future backlogs of these products  we cannot be certain that these plans  even if executed properly  will be sufficient to prevent future backlog of these products or that other product backlogs will not occur in the future 
any such future backlogs will potentially result in higher production costs  higher freight costs to expedite shipment of raw materials and finished goods  fines from certain retailers  cancelled orders and lost opportunity costs 
these in turn could materially affect our results of operations and financial condition 
our pricing dispute with ist could harm our swab product sales our current pricing with our swab product supplier  ist  is fixed by contract until the end of fiscal  at which time we will be required to review and negotiate new pricing terms 
in the first quarter of  ist advised us of an increase in pricing for the balance of we have advised ist of our opposition to this pricing increase on the basis that it is not permitted by our contract  and we are presently examining options to resolve this issue 
while we intend to act in a manner that will not trigger an interruption in ist s supply to us of the swab products  which may include our paying the disputed price increase under protest pending resolution of this issue  it is possible that ist could suspend or terminate swab production  or threaten to do so  in an effort to force our acceptance of its new terms 
any such suspension or termination of swab production would have a material adverse effect on our product sales and  accordingly  our results of operations and financial condition 
the large number of shares eligible for immediate and future sales may depress the price of our stock sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the open market or the availability of a large number of additional shares for sale could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
substantially all of our outstanding shares of common stock  as well as the shares underlying vested but as yet unexercised warrants and options  have either been registered for public sale or may be sold under rule promulgated under the securities act of  as amended 
therefore  all of these shares may be immediately sold by the holders 
a substantial increase in sales of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock 
our board of directors is authorized to issue shares of preferred stock that could have rights superior to our outstanding shares of common stock  and  if issued  could adversely impact the value of our common stock our certificate of incorporation permits our board of directors  in its sole discretion  to issue up to  shares of authorized but unissued preferred stock 
these shares may be issued by our board without further action by our shareholders  and may include any of the following rights among others as our board may determine  which rights may be superior to the rights of our outstanding common stock voting rights  including the right to vote as a class on particular matters  preferences as to dividends and liquidation rights  conversion rights  anti dilution protections  and redemption rights 
since our board of directors has the authority to determine  from time to time  the terms of our authorized preferred stock  there is no limit on the amount of common stock that could be issuable upon conversion of any future series of preferred stock that may be issued 
the rights of holders of our common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any series of preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
in addition  the market price of our common stock may be adversely affected by the issuance of any series of preferred stock with voting or other rights superior to those of our common stock 
the issuance of any series of preferred stock could also have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding common stock 
the price of our stock may continue to be volatile the market price of our common stock  which is quoted for trading on the nasdaq national market  has been highly volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future 
any or a combination of the following factors could cause the market value of our common stock to decline quickly operating results that differ from market expectations  negative or other unanticipated results of clinical trials or other testing  delays in product development  technological innovations or commercial product introductions by our competitors  changes in government regulations  developments concerning proprietary rights  including pending or threatened patent litigation  public concerns regarding the safety of any of our products and general economic and stock market conditions 
since the spring of  the stock market has experienced  and it may continue to experience  significant price and volume fluctuations 
these fluctuations have particularly affected the market prices of equity securities of many small capitalization companies  like matrixx  that are not yet profitable or that experience low or inconsistent earnings 
often  the effect on the price of such securities is disproportionate to the operating performance of such companies 
in our case  such broad market fluctuations may adversely affect our stockholders ability to dispose of their shares of matrixx at a price equal to or above the price at which they purchased such shares 
item a
