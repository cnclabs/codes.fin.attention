item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview bank mutual is a united states corporation chartered by the ots 
it was chartered on november   to become the mid tier holding company in the regulatory restructuring of mutual savings bank into mutual holding company form 
to accomplish the transaction  mutual savings bank adopted a plan of restructuring and as of november   converted from a mutual savings bank to a mutual holding company 
bank mutual became a holder of all of the shares of mutual savings bank  which was rechartered as a federal stock savings bank 
mutual savings bancorp  mhc  a us chartered mutual holding company of which mutual savings bank s depositors hold all of the voting and membership rights  owns  shares  or of bank mutual s outstanding common stock 
bank mutual issued  shares of common stock to public shareholders in the subscription stock offering conducted in connection with the restructuring 
net proceeds to bank mutual were million 
expenses related to the offering totaled million and million was loaned by bank mutual to bank mutual s employee stock ownership plan esop to purchase  shares of common stock 
on november   bank mutual acquired first northern capital corp 
first northern  the parent of first northern savings bank 
in the first northern acquisition  bank mutual issued to former first northern shareholders  shares of bank mutual common stock and paid million in cash 
the first northern acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  therefore  first northern results and financial data are included in bank mutual results and financial data only from and after the november  acquisition date 
prior to that date  the data are those of mutual savings bank 
the first northern acquisition substantially affects the comparison of the financial condition of bank mutual at december   and the comparison of results of operations for on march   mutual savings bank and first northern savings bank combined to form a single subsidiary bank of bank mutual 
there are no expected office closings or sales  and no employees are expected to be severed as a result of the combination 
in connection with the following discussion  see cautionary statements in item of this document regarding forward looking statements and factors that could impact the business and financial prospects of bank mutual 
significant accounting policies there are a number of accounting policies that we established which require us to use our judgement 
some of the more significant policies are as follows establishing the amount of the allowance for loan losses requires the use of our judgement 
we evaluate our assets at least quarterly  and review their risk components as a part of that evaluation 
see notes to consolidated financial statements note summary of significant accounting policies allowance for loan losses for a discussion of the risk components 
if we misjudge a major component and experience a loss  it will likely affect our earnings 
we consistently challenge ourselves in the review of the risk components to identify any changes in trends and their cause 
another valuation that requires our judgement relates to mortgage servicing rights 
essentially  mortgage servicing rights are established on loans primarily mortgage loans that we originate and sell 
we allocate a portion of a loan s book basis to mortgage servicing rights when a loan is sold  based upon its relative fair value 
the fair value of mortgage servicing rights is the present value of estimated future net cash flows from the servicing relationship using current market assumptions for prepayments  servicing costs and other factors 
as the loans are repaid and net servicing revenue is earned  mortgage servicing rights are amortized into expense 
net servicing revenues are expected to exceed this amortization expense 
however  if our actual prepayment experience exceeds what we originally anticipated  net servicing revenues may be less than expected and mortgage servicing rights may be impaired 
this impairment would be recorded as a charge to earnings as experienced in we also use our judgement in the valuation of other intangible assets core deposit based intangibles 
core deposit based intangible assets have been recorded for core deposits defined as checking  money market and savings deposits that have been acquired in acquisitions that were accounted for as purchase business combinations 
the core deposit based intangible assets have been recorded using the assumption that they provide a more favorable source of funding than more expensive wholesale borrowings 
an intangible asset has been recorded for the present value of the difference between the expected interest to be incurred on these deposits and interest expense that would be expected if these deposits were replaced by wholesale borrowings  over the expected lives of the core deposits 
we currently estimate the underlying core deposits have lives of seven to fifteen years 
if we find these deposits have a shorter life  we will have to write down the asset by expensing the amount that is impaired 
we review goodwill at least annually for impairment  which requires the use of our judgement 
goodwill has been recorded as a result of two acquisitions in which purchase price exceeded the fair value of net assets acquired 
we analyze the price paid for those acquisitions and compare those to a number of current indices 
in particular  we look at the price paid as a percent of assets  price paid to deposits  premium paid to core deposits  and other indicators 
if the current indices are such that would indicate that the existing goodwill is more than the goodwill that would be developed by doing the same transaction today  impairment would occur and as such  would be charged to current earnings 
comparisons of financial condition at december  and bank mutual s total assets decreased million  or  to billion at december  as compared to billion at december  the decrease in assets was the result of loan sales  the proceeds of which reduced the mortgage loan portfolio  and were used to pay off borrowings 
these and other factors affecting the total assets are discussed in more detail below 
federal funds sold decreased by million to million at december  as compared to million at december  the decrease was primarily the result of using the federal funds sold to purchase mortgage related securities 
investment securities available for sale decreased million as a result of maturing investments which were primarily reinvested into mortgage related securities 
mortgage related securities increased million to million at december  as compared to million at december  throughout  mortgage related securities experienced continued historically high rates of repayments due to the prepayments of the underlying mortgage loans which in turn resulted from the high level of refinancing activity 
the majority of cash from these prepayments were reinvested into mortgage related securities 
the effect of these purchases was to reduce the average yield on mortgage related investment portfolio to during december  as compared to during december  see item hereof for further information as to our investment portfolio  the caption investment activities is incorporated herein by reference 
the following table sets forth our mortgage  consumer and commercial loan originations and purchases during the year ended december  in thousands originations mortgage loans   consumer loans   commercial business loans   total loans originated   purchases mortgage loans   total loans purchased   total loans originated and purchased   loan originations increased million in primarily as a result of historically low interest rates which prompted consumers to refinance their existing loans 
existing higher interest rate fixed rate mortgage loans and adjustable rate mortgage loans were refinanced primarily into lower interest rate fixed rate mortgage loans 
these fixed rate mortgage loans were sold in the secondary market which resulted in a net reduction in our mortgage loan portfolio 
consumer loan originations also increased substantially as a result of special product offerings such as a year fixed rate fully amortizing second mortgage loan and consumers refinancing their existing debt 
a majority of the consumer loan originations were second mortgage loans 
commercial business loan originations decreased in as a result of the slowdown of the economy and the resulting hesitation by businesses to expand or increase production 
we anticipate that we will continue our emphasis on consumer and commercial loan originations as it aids in our interest rate risk management and provides for higher yields  although at somewhat more risk than traditional mortgage products 
total loans receivable net decreased million as a result of our sale of million of fixed rate single family mortgage loans which was not fully offset by the origination or purchases of new loans added to the portfolio 
we sell a majority of our fixed rate mortgage loan originations to reduce our interest rate risk 
within the total loan portfolio  our commercial real estate portfolio increased million  our construction and development loans increased million  our consumer loan portfolio grew million and our commercial business portfolio grew  we continued to emphasize growth in these portfolios to meet the needs in our market area 
our one to four family portfolio decreased million and our multi family decreased million as a result of customer refinancings and  in the case of our one to four family mortgage loans  the decrease was also due to the sales of fixed rate mortgage loans 
for further information on our loans  see asset quality in item hereof  which is incorporated herein by reference 
goodwill resulted from the acquisition of first northern in and first federal bancshares of eau claire first federal in under the financial accounting standards board fasb no 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment 
if goodwill is determined to be impaired  it would be expensed in the period in which it became impaired 
an impairment occurred in with respect to million of intangible assets resulting from the acquisition of first federal 
other intangible assets are composed of core deposit based intangibles which were also the result of the first northern and first federal acquisitions 
other intangible assets are amortized over its expected life and tested for impairment at least annually 
mortgage servicing rights are established on loans primarily mortgage loans that we originate and sell 
see significant accounting policies above and within comparisons of operating results for years ended december  and noninterest income below for a further discussion of mortgage servicing rights 
other assets are comprised of the following at december  in thousands accrued interest mortgage related securities   investment securities   loans receivable   total accrued interest   foreclosed properties and repossessed assets premises and equipment   federal home loan bank stock  at cost   life insurance policies   other   our foreclosed properties and repossessed assets increased  to  at december  as a result of foreclosures on a few single family homes 
we believe that we continue to have good quality assets and the homes  boats  recreational vehicles and other items that have been repossessed  are small in dollar amount in comparison to the size of our loan portfolio 
premises and equipment increased  in as a result of purchasing new computer equipment and software for both subsidiary banks in anticipation of our march combination 
we also have purchased a new loan origination system which is being integrated into our operations 
the effect of these two events was to increase our equipment depreciation expense 
in addition  we are establishing a new office in menomonee falls  wi a suburb of milwaukee  wi and a replacement office for our ashwaubenon office a village adjacent to green bay  wi 
it is anticipated the menomonee falls office will cost approximately million and the ashwaubenon office will cost approximately million 
both offices are expected to be operational in the third or fourth quarter of fhlb of chicago stock increased million primarily as a result of stock dividends paid by the fhlb of chicago 
the fhlb of chicago requires the ownership of fhlb of chicago stock to borrow 
the fhlb of chicago has targeted a rate of return for their stock of over the year constant maturity treasury note yield 
historically  the fhlb of chicago stock has met or exceeded its targeted returns but we cannot assure that will continue 
see notes to consolidated financial statements note borrowings 
life insurance policies or bank owned life insurance boli is an asset that is used to partially offset the future cost of employee benefits 
boli is long term life insurance on the lives of certain current and past employees where the insurance policy benefits and ownership are retained by us 
the cash value accumulation on boli is permanently tax deferred if the policy is held to the participant s death 
deposits increased million in the year we believe the stock market decline in and  coupled with world events throughout this period  have made some consumers re evaluate their investment objectives and  hence  their investment portfolios 
as a result of this re evaluation  more investors have included a greater percentage of insured deposits within their investment mix 
we also believe that deposit growth or shrinkage in and future periods will depend  in significant part  on the performance of other investment alternatives and world events 
our borrowings decreased million in as a result of the cash received from loan sales and the increase in deposits 
we anticipate that we will continue to pay off maturing borrowings in as a result of our cash position  although our ability to make those payments will depend upon our actual future results and our future financial needs 
most of our borrowings are from the federal home loan bank of chicago 
of these amounts  approximately million are callable by the fhlb 
we reflect them in our financial statements as due in  which is their stated maturity date  because we have received indications from the fhlb that other borrowings would be available if the borrowings are called earlier 
shareholders equity increased million as a result of net income  increased comprehensive income and stock option exercises offset by the repurchase of our common stock and the payment of cash dividends 
our shareholders equity to total asset ratio at december  was as compared to at december  we began a stock repurchase program in and as of december   we had repurchased  shares at an average cost of per share 
we used  of the  shares repurchased to institute a restricted stock awards program under the bank mutual corporation stock incentive plan  which shareholders approved in may see notes to consolidated financial statements note stock based benefit plans 
after december   through february   we purchased an additional  shares at an average cost of per share 
we increased our quarterly cash dividend to per share for the first two quarters of and again increased the cash dividend to per share for the last two quarters of for a total cash dividend paid in of per share 
the dividend payout was since mutual savings bancorp  mhc elected to waive cash dividends in on its  shares of bank mutual 
average balance sheet and yield rate analysis the following table presents  for the periods indicated  the total dollar amount of interest income from average interest earning assets  the resultant yields  and the interest expense on average interest bearing liabilities  expressed both in dollars and rates 
no tax equivalent adjustments were made since we do not have any tax exempt investments 
average balances are derived from average daily balances 
the yield on securities available for sale is included in investment securities and mortgage related securities and yields are calculated on the historical basis 
the yields and rates are established by dividing income or expense dollars by the average balance of the asset or liability

interest rate spread is the difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average cost on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin is determined by dividing net interest income by total interest earning assets 
rate volume analysis 
the following table presents the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities have affected our interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated 
information is provided in each category with respect to changes attributable to changes in volume change in volume multiplied by prior rate  changes attributable to change in rate changes in rate multiplied by prior volume  and the net change 
the changes attributable to the combined impact of volume and rate have been allocated proportionately to the changes due to volume and the changes due to rate 
year ended december  compared to increase decrease due to volume rate net in thousands interest earning assets loans receivable    mortgage related securities    investment securities    interest earning deposits federal funds   total    interest bearing liabilities savings deposits   money market deposits    interest bearing demand deposits time deposits    advance payment by borrowers for taxes and insurance borrowings    total    net change in net interest income   year ended december  compared to increase decrease due to volume rate net in thousands interest earning assets loans receivable   mortgage related securities  investment securities    interest earning deposits federal funds   total    interest bearing liabilities savings deposits   money market deposits   interest bearing demand deposits time deposits   advance payment by borrowers for taxes and insurance borrowings   total    net change in net interest income    comparisons of operating results for years ended december  and general net income for the year ended december  was million as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily a result of historically low interest rates which produced record mortgage loan originations and sales  the elimination of goodwill amortization  gains on the sales of loans and increased net interest margin  partially offset by the impairment of mortgage servicing rights 
net interest income net interest income for increased million  or  to million for as compared to million for net interest income increased primarily as a result of the increase in the net interest margin 
the net interest margin for was  as compared to in the federal reserve reduced interest rates which helped to improve the net interest margin for the banks 
historically  reduced interest rates have improved the net interest margin  as the banks were generally able to reduce the interest rates paid on interest bearing liabilities more quickly than interest rates charged on interest earning assets 
that effect benefited results in  however  the high level of mortgage refinancing activity in which higher interest rate mortgage loans were paid off and the sales of fixed rate mortgage loans partially offset the effects of the reduced cost of interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income outlook because of the length of time in which interest rates have been declining and the unprecedented levels of refinancing activity  we expect that we will experience  at least in early  a somewhat different effect than we have recently experienced 
the loan refinancing has reduced yields on loans going forward more quickly than we are able to reduce the already substantially lowered interest rates on deposits and other liabilities 
further  a significant portion of the proceeds of loan refinancings have been reinvested in relatively lower yielding investment securities  as we generally sell fixed rate mortgages 
if interest rates continue to remain stable or move lower in  we anticipate that our net interest margin would be compressed reduced as a result of the continued reductions to the yields on interest earning assets as compared to a more modest decrease to rates on our interest bearing liabilities 
as a result of that compression  we would expect that our net income would be reduced in as compared to  which we expect would reduce net interest income 
if  however  interest rates begin to rise during  there could be a positive effect on the loan portfolio  resulting from increased originations of adjustable rate loans  which in turn may offset the reductions in yields and net interest income 
total interest income total interest income decreased million or to million as compared to million for the decrease was primarily the result of existing mortgage loans refinancing to a lower interest rate  sales of fixed rate mortgage loans and using the proceeds from the sales to invest in mortgage related securities purchased at a lower yield than the yields on the loans sold  and prepayments on higher yielding mortgage related securities 
interest income on loans decreased million or primarily as a result of the refinancing of existing loans to lower interest rate loans  originations at interest rates that were below the existing yield on the portfolio and to a lesser extent  downward interest rate modifications on certain existing loans 
although we had record loan originations  a majority of those originations were fixed rate 
we sell the majority of our fixed rate single family mortgage loans to the secondary market which helps us to manage our interest rate risk 
these actions reduced our average yield to in as compared to in interest on investments decreased million in as compared to as a result of maturing investments being reinvested at a lower yield and some of the maturing dollars being invested into mortgage related securities 
interest on mortgage related securities increased million in as a result of additional mortgage related securities outstanding offset by the reduced yield on the portfolio 
the average mortgage related securities outstanding for was million as compared to million in the average yield on this portfolio was for as compared to in the decrease in yield was the result of prepayments of higher yielding mortgage related securities and the reinvestment of those dollars and additional funds into lower yielding mortgage related securities 
interest income on interest earning deposits which includes investments in federal funds decreased million to million in as compared to million in although the average balance for increased million as compared to the average balance  the primary reason for the decrease in interest income was the reduced average yield earned on those deposits 
the yield on interest earning deposits was substantially impacted by the federal reserve s interest rate reductions throughout and the one federal reserve interest rate reduction in which affected market interest rates 
total interest expense interest expense on deposits decreased substantially in the decrease of million  or  was the result of the decreased cost of those deposits partially offset by the growth in deposits 
we believe the growth in deposits was the result of continued uncertainties in the stock market and world events 
at the same time  market interest rates were being decreased thereby reducing the cost of new and renewing deposits 
the average cost of deposits for was as compared to in if the stock market value would rise or world events stabilized  we believe some of the deposits we acquired in and may be withdrawn to fund customer investments in the stock market 
in addition  market interest rates may rise and increase the cost of our deposits 
interest expense on borrowings decreased million to million in as compared to million in the decrease was the result of maturing borrowings being paid off 
provisions for loan losses we provided  for loan losses in as compared to  in the provision in was in response to increased commercial loan delinquencies  charge offs  changes in the loan portfolio mix reduction in one to four family loans and an increase in comparatively riskier commercial real estate  development and commercial loans and a weakening economy  partially offset by the decrease in the dollar amount of the loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses at december  was million or of non performing loans and of non performing assets as compared to million or of non performing loans and of non performing assets at december  the loan loss allowance to total loans was at december  as compared to at december  future provisions for loan losses will continue to be based upon our assessment of the overall loan portfolio and the underlying collateral  trends in non performing loans  current economic conditions and other relevant factors in order to maintain the allowance for loan losses at adequate levels to provide for probable and estimatable future losses 
the establishment of the amount of the loan loss allowance inherently involves judgements by management as to the adequacy of the allowance  which ultimately may or may not be correct 
higher rates of loan defaults than anticipated would likely result in a need to increase provisions in future years 
also  as multi family and commercial loan portfolios increase  additional provisions would likely be added to the loan loss allowances as they carry a higher risk of loss 
see also asset quality in item  which is incorporated by reference  for certain other factors that may affect our provisions for loan losses on a go forward basis 
noninterest income total noninterest income increased  to million in as compared to million in this increase was primarily a result of increased gains on the sales of loans partially offset by the impairment of mortgage servicing rights 
service charges on deposits increased  in as a result of increased usage of debit cards and fees from checking accounts 
we emphasize checking accounts as we believe it is the primary account which enables us to develop other business with the customer 
brokerage and insurance commissions increased  to million in as compared to million in the increase was primarily the result of increased sales of tax deferred annuity products 
loan related fees were substantially affected by the impairment of mortgage servicing rights in a total of million of mortgage servicing rights were determined to be impaired in and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  a valuation allowance was established with an offsetting charge against loan related fees 
offsetting the mortgage servicing rights impairment was the collection of fees on mortgage loans that had their interest rates reduced before their initial lock in period had expired or before their next interest adjustment date  and fees collected from our fixed rate modification program which allowed fixed rate mortgage loan consumers to negotiate a lower fixed rate without the cost of a complete refinance of their existing mortgage loan 
gains on the sales of loans increased million to million in as compared to million in this increase was the result of low market interest rates  which spurred significant refinancings and a large number of fixed rate mortgage loan originations 
we sell most of these fixed rate mortgage loans to the secondary market to reduce our interest rate risk 
we anticipate that loan sales  and related fee income  will be substantially less in as compared to if interest rates stabilize or rise from december  levels 
other noninterest income decreased  to million in as compared to million in the decrease is primarily the result of a settlement of a life insurance policy in and the sale of real estate owned in noninterest expense total noninterest expense decreased  to million in as compared to million in the decrease was the result of changes in accounting rules relating to the amortization of goodwill resulting from prior acquisitions offset by an increase in compensation expense 
as a result of those accounting rule changes  we no longer amortize goodwill 
compensation expense increased million or to million in as compared to million in the increase was primarily the result of increased health care costs  increased expense associated with the employee stock ownership plan  normal pay increases to existing employees  and incentive payouts to loan originators for the high volume of loan originations 
based on contracts in place and market conditions  we expect our health insurance costs to continue to increase significantly in occupancy and equipment expense increased  primarily from increased depreciation expense of computer equipment and software related to implementation of a new teller platform and a new loan origination documentation system 
in addition  we anticipate that in  we will be opening a new branch office cost estimated to be million  a replacement office for an existing office cost estimated to be million and as a result of the merger of the two subsidiary banks  replacing signage cost estimated to be 
the effect of both of these new offices and signage replacement will be to increase our occupancy expense 
the amortization of goodwill was significantly changed in as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
as a result  other intangibles continue to be amortized  goodwill is no longer amortized over a stated period of time but rather it remains on the statement of financial condition and periodically tested for impairment 
that change increased pre tax earnings and after tax earnings by million in as compared to if goodwill is found to be impaired  the impaired amount is expensed to current operations  which would negatively affect the results in any period in which such an impairment was determined 
see notes to consolidated financial statements note summary of significant accounting policies recent accounting changes 
other expenses decreased  or to million in as compared to million in the decrease was the result of the reduction in real estate owned expense and the reduction in loan expenses in also  in  we anticipate we will increase our marketing budget by approximately million to aid in the consolidation of the two subsidiary banks 
income taxes income tax expense increased  to million in as compared to million in the increase was the result of increased taxable income 
however  the effective income tax rate decreased to in as compared to in primarily as a result of the elimination of the goodwill amortization expense 
goodwill amortization is a nondeductible tax expense and therefore resulted in the effective tax rate being higher than comparisons of operating results for years ended december  and general net income for the year ended december  was million as compared to million of the year ended december the increase is primarily a result of including a full year of operations of first northern savings bank in and historically low interest rates  which produced record mortgage loan originations and sales 
net interest income net interest income for increased million  or  to million for as compared to million for net interest income increased primarily as a result of the first northern acquisition and growth in interest earning assets 
the net interest margin for was  as compared to in interest rates were substantially affected by federal reserve actions during the net interest margin was compressed throughout as a result of market interest rates moving upward as the federal reserve moved to increase interest rates early in the year to slow the pace of the economic expansion 
however  the federal reserve quickly reversed its restrictive growth mode  beginning in early  by reducing interest rates throughout reduced interests rates have historically improved the banks net interest margin  as the banks are generally able to reduce the interest rates paid on interest bearing liabilities more quickly than interest rates charged on interest earning assets 
that was mitigated somewhat during by the high level of mortgage refinancing activity in which higher interest rate loans were paid off 
total interest income total interest income increased million  or  to million for as compared to million for the increase in total interest income was primarily the result of the first northern acquisition and growth in federal funds sold and securities 
interest income on loans rose substantially in primarily from the first northern acquisition 
our loan originations were strong in  especially fixed interest rate mortgage loans  however  we sold the majority of our fixed rate mortgage loans to the secondary market 
in addition to respond to the lower interest rate environment  we allowed some customers with our adjustable interest rate mortgage loans to reduce their interest rate for a fee  before the expiration of their initial lock in period or next adjustment date 
these actions  along with our continued emphasis on multi family and commercial loan originations  stabilized our average yield at for interest on investments increased million as a result of the full years results from the first northern acquisition and the increase in securities in interest on mortgage related securities decreased million in although the average balances of mortgage related securities for increased million 
the average yield on mortgage related securities in decreased to from in this decrease in yield was the result of prepayments of higher yielding mortgage related securities and the reinvestment of those dollars and additional money into lower yielding mortgage related securities 
interest income on interest earning deposits increased million in as a result of additional dollars invested throughout as deposits and loan sales increased  the additional cash was invested in short term investments 
however  as market interest rates decreased as a result of the federal reserve s actions the yield on these investments also decreased 
total interest expense interest expense on deposits increased million  or  to million in compared to million in this increase was the result of the effect of the first northern acquisition over the full year and growth in deposits 
we believe the growth in deposits was the result of the uncertainties in the stock market and world events 
at the same time  market interest rates were being decreased as a result of federal reserve actions thereby reducing the average cost of deposits to for as compared to for borrowing expense increased million  or  to million in as compared to million in this increase is a result of the full year affect of the first northern acquisition partially offset by the reduction in borrowings 
most of the borrowings are with fhlb of chicago and have fixed interest rates and terms 
provision for loan losses we provided  for loan losses in as compared to  in the provision was increased in as a result of the change in the loan portfolio mix reduction in one to four family loans and an increase in comparatively riskier multi family and commercial loans and charge offs  as well as the weakening of the economy 
the allowance for loan losses at december  was million or of non performing loans and of non performing assets 
the loan loss allowance to total loans is as compared to at december  noninterest income total noninterest income increased million  or  to million in as compared to million in the increase is primarily the result of the first northern acquisition and a significant increase in gains on the sales of loans 
service charges on deposits and brokerage and insurance commissions increased million and million  respectively  as a result of the first northern acquisition and increased sales of tax deferred annuity products 
loan related fees increased million primarily as a result of two factors 
first  fees collected on adjustable rate mortgage loans that had their interest rates reduced before their initial lock in period had expired or before their next interest adjustment date 
the fee varied with the option the customer chose 
second  fees collected from our fixed rate modification program which allowed fixed rate mortgage loan customers to negotiate a lower fixed rate without the cost of a complete refinance of their existing mortgage loan 
gains on the sales of loans increased million to million in as compared to million in this substantial increase was the result of low market interest rates  which spurred significant refinancings and a large number of fixed rate mortgage loans to be originated 
we sell most of these fixed rate mortgage loans to the secondary market to reduce our interest rate risk 
other noninterest income increased million or to million in as compared to million in the increase is primarily the result of the first northern acquisition  a settlement of a life insurance policy and other miscellaneous fees 
noninterest expense total noninterest expense increased million to million in as compared to million in the increase was primarily the result of the acquisition of first northern and its first full year of operations  the implementation of stock based benefit plans and normal increased cost of operations 
compensation expense increased million or to million in as compared to million in the increase was the result of the acquisition of first northern and its first full year of operations  the million in expense associated with the employee stock ownership plan  the implementation of a restricted stock awards plan resulting in  of expense in  increased health care costs  and incentive payouts to loan originators for the high volume of loan originations 
occupancy and equipment expense increased million primarily from the acquisition of first northern and its first full year of operations with bank mutual 
the amortization of goodwill and the amortization of other intangible assets increased substantially in as compared to the million increase in the amortization of goodwill and the  increase in the amortization of other intangibles were the result of the increased amortization from the goodwill and other intangible assets created from the acquisition of first northern in november our efficiency ratio excluding the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets was in as compared to in income taxes income tax expense increased million to million in as compared to million in the increase was the result of increased taxable income 
the effective income tax rate in was as compared to in liquidity and capital resources the term liquidity refers to our ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to fund loan originations  loan purchases  deposit withdrawals  and operating expenses 
our primary sources of funds are deposits  scheduled amortization  and prepayments of loan principal and mortgage related securities  maturities and calls of investment securities  borrowings from the fhlb of chicago and funds provided by our operations 
historically  these sources of funds have been adequate to maintain liquidity  with the banks borrowing correspondingly more in periods in which their operations generate less cash 
in the event these sources of liquidity would become inadequate  bank mutual believes that it could access the wholesale deposit market  although there can be no assurances that wholesale deposits would be available if needed 
loan repayments and maturing investment securities are a relatively predictable source of funds 
however  deposit flows  calls of investment securities and prepayments of loans and mortgage related securities are strongly influenced by interest rates  general and local economic conditions and competition in the marketplace 
for example  during  loan prepayments increased significantly because of the reduced interest rate environment  another very different interest rate environment could lead to a significantly different result 
these factors reduce the predictability of the timing of these sources of funds 
our primary investing activities are the origination and purchase of one to four family real estate loans  multi family and commercial real estate loans  home equity loans  other consumer loans  commercial business loans  the purchase of mortgage related securities  and to a lesser extent  the purchase of investment securities 
these investing activities were funded by principal payments on mortgage loans and mortgage related securities  calls and maturities on investment securities  borrowings  deposit growth  and funds provided by our operating activities 
at december   bank mutual had outstanding loan commitments to borrowers of approximately million  unused commercial lines of credit of approximately million  and available home equity  overdraft lines of credit and unused credit card lines of credit of approximately million 
there were no outstanding commitments to purchase securities at december  we are committed to maintaining a strong liquidity position  therefore  we monitor our liquidity position on a daily basis 
based upon our historical experience and available sources of liquidity  we anticipate that we will have sufficient funds from operations and or borrowing capacity to meet current funding commitments 
see also management of interest rate risk gap analysis in item a hereof  which is incorporated herein by reference  which discusses maturities  and notes to consolidated financial statements note other assets  which includes a summary of future lease obligations 
at december   we exceeded each of the applicable regulatory capital requirements for both savings bank subsidiaries

see notes to consolidated financial statements note shareholders equity 
because ots regulations require that the mhc own at least a majority of the outstanding shares of bank mutual  and currently of bank mutual s common shares are owned by persons other than the mhc  the future issuance of bank mutual common stock is not expected to be a significant source of capital resources for bank mutual as long as the mutual holding company structure remains in place 
shareholders equity is decreased by unearned esop shares  which represents shares in the bank mutual employee stock ownership plan which had not yet been earned by participating employees  and unearned deferred compensation  which represents stock grants under the management recognition plan mrp component of its stock incentive plan 
see notes to consolidated financial statements note summary of significant accounting policies 
shareholders equity is increased by million of accumulated other comprehensive income  consisting primarily of increased market value of securities available for sale 
bank mutual repurchased  shares under its stock repurchase program  of these amounts   shares were used for restricted stock awards of which  shares were forfeited and  shares were used for exercised stock options  leaving  shares held as treasury shares at fiscal year end 
cash and cash equivalents decreased million during  however  we still maintained million of cash and cash equivalents at december  bank mutual provided million in investing activities  primarily as a result of the decrease in the loan portfolio caused by the sale of fixed rate mortgage loans  offset by purchases of investment securities and principal repayments on mortgage related securities 
the cash provided by investing activities was combined with the cash provided by operating activities and netted against cash used by financing activities 
the cash from operating activities is primarily a result of bank mutual s net income for the year  and non cash expenses  offset by net change in loans originated for sale 
cash used by financing activities resulted primarily from repayments of long term borrowings and treasury stock purchases  offset by deposit growth 
impact of inflation and changing prices the financial statements and accompanying notes of bank mutual have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
gaap generally requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration for changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations 
unlike industrial companies  our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature 
as a result  changes in market interest rates have a greater impact on performance than do the effects of inflation 
risk factors in addition to the various factors discussed above  you should consider carefully the following risk factors when evaluating bank mutual s performance and outlook 
changing interest rates may hurt our profits 
to be profitable  we have to earn more money in interest and fees than we pay as interest and other expenses 
of our first mortgage loans maturing after one year  a majority have interest rates that are fixed for the term of the loan 
while most of our deposit accounts consist of checking accounts  money market accounts  savings accounts and time deposit accounts with remaining terms to maturity of less than one year  most of our loans have longer remaining terms 
it is unlikely that interest rates will continue to decline in the near future in the dramatic way in which they did during although we have a positive gap at december   if interest rates rise substantially  the amount of interest we pay on deposits is likely to increase more quickly than the amount of interest we receive on our loans  mortgage related securities and investment securities 
this would cause our profits to decrease 
rising interest rates would likely reduce the value of our mortgage related securities and investment securities and may decrease demand for loans and make it more difficult for borrowers to repay their loans 
if interest rates remain stable or fall  our net interest income is also likely to be reduced because the heavy refinancing activity  which already has occurred  will likely continue to increase the portion of our assets in relatively lower yielding investments and also lower average yields on loans more quickly than we can lower rates on deposits and other interest bearing liabilities 
for additional information on our exposure to interest rates  see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management of interest rate risk 
increases in market interest rates are likely to adversely affect equity 
as of december   we owned million of securities available for sale 
generally accepted accounting principles require that we carry these securities at fair value on our balance sheet 
unrealized gains or losses on these securities  reflecting the difference between the fair market value and the amortized cost  net of its tax effect  are carried as a component of shareholders equity 
when market rates of interest increase  the fair value of our securities available for sale generally decreases and equity correspondingly decreases 
when rates decrease  fair value generally increases and shareholders equity correspondingly increases 
as of december   bank mutual s available for sale portfolio had an unrealized gain of million  because fair value was million and amortized cost was million 
while bank mutual has benefited from the decrease in interest rates during  continuing decreases of this magnitude are unlikely to occur in the near future 
the economic recession and world events could affect our earnings 
the united states economy  which was softening during  entered into a recession during early and has continued through according to economists 
the recession  or at least a soft economy  is generally believed to have continued into early  and it is not yet clear whether a recovery has begun or when one will begin 
when a recovery begins  we do not know how swift or strong it will be or how long it would continue 
the effects of a recession  or a weak economy  can significantly affect our operations and profitability 
for example  higher unemployment and reduced business sales or profits can make it more difficult for borrowers to repay their loans 
similarly  reduced income or confidence can lead consumers to reduce their purchases  and thus reduce loan demand 
the weakness in the national and local economies have been exacerbated by the attacks of september  and their aftermath and other world events such as the possibility of an armed conflict 
bank mutual  and the economy as a whole  may be affected by future world events  such as acts of terrorism or developments in the war on terrorism 
low demand for real estate loans may lower our profitability 
making loans secured by real estate is our primary business and primary source of profits 
if customer demand for real estate loans decreases  our profits may decrease because our alternative investments  primarily securities  earn less income for us than real estate loans 
customer demand for loans secured by real estate could be reduced by a weaker economy  an increase in unemployment  a decrease in real estate values or an increase in interest rates 
strong competition within our market area may reduce our customer base 
we encounter strong competition both in attracting deposits and originating real estate and other loans 
we compete with commercial banks  savings institutions  mortgage banking firms  credit unions  finance companies  mutual funds  insurance companies  and brokerage and investment banking firms 
our market area includes branches of several commercial banks that are substantially larger than us in terms of deposits and loans 
in addition  tax exempt credit unions operate in most of our market area and aggressively price their products and services to a large part of the population 
our profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully maintain or increase our market share 
we are expanding our lending activities in riskier areas 
we have identified commercial real estate  commercial business and consumer loans as areas for increased lending emphasis  and our loans of these types increased both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of our portfolio during while increased lending diversification is expected to increase interest income  non residential loans carry greater risk of payment default than residential real estate loans 
as the volume of these loans increase  credit risk increases 
in the event of substantial borrower defaults  our provision for loan losses would increase and therefore  earnings would be reduced 
our consumer loan portfolio included million of indirect auto loans at december  indirect auto lending was not a business line for mutual savings prior to the first northern acquisition  but was begun with a portfolio then acquired 
although first northern has experienced minimal delinquencies in its automobile loan portfolio historically  borrowers may be more likely to become delinquent on an automobile loan than on a residential real estate loan 
moreover  unlike the collateral for real estate loans  automobiles depreciate rapidly and  in the event of default  principal loss as a percent of the loan balance depends upon the mileage and condition of the vehicle at the time of repossession  over which bank mutual has no control 
similarly  any non real estate collateral securing commercial business loans may depreciate over time and fluctuate in value 
mutual savings and first northern savings bank may not integrate as we hope 
mutual savings and first northern savings bank combined as of march   changing the bank s name to bank mutual in the process 
we have not experienced any significant problems  such as customer loss or difficulties from our systems conversions  however  we may find that the operations and management philosophies will not combine as well as we expect  which could lead to operating inefficiencies and complications going forward 
we also may experience customer resistance to  or confusion from  the change in the name of our banks 
we have significant intangible assets which we may need to write off expense in the future 
bank mutual has approximately million in goodwill  million in other intangible assets and million of mortgage servicing rights as of december  as a result of sfas no 
 bank mutual no longer amortizes goodwill but will continue to amortize the other intangible assets over seven to fifteen years and will evaluate the mortgage servicing rights for impairment on a monthly basis 
we will periodically check goodwill  and the other intangible assets for impairment 
at some point in the future  our intangible assets may become impaired  and we would need to write them off as a reduction to earnings in the period in which they became impaired 
for example  in mutual savings bank wrote off million of impaired goodwill and intangible assets from the acquisition of first federal 
even though this special write off did not affect our cash position  our results were reduced by this action 
future periods could be similarly affected 
stock based and other benefits affect our results 
we have adopted a stock incentive plan which provided for the granting of options to purchase common stock and for awards of common stock to our eligible officers  employees and directors 
we also have an employee stock ownership plan  and have adopted a restoration plan that will supplement the benefits to selected executive officers under the employee stock ownership plan and our k plan 
the cost of the employee stock ownership plan will vary based on our stock price at specific points in the future 
additionally  we experienced a significant increase in employee health care costs in  and expect further significant increases in these expenses will continue to affect our future earnings  as may other factors  such as government mandates  which would further increase the cost of compensation and or benefits that are provided to employees 
the mhc s control over bank mutual may prevent transactions you would like 
the mhc is managed by generally the same directors and officers who manage bank mutual 
because the mhc owns a majority of bank mutual s common stock  the board of directors of the mhc controls the outcome of most matters put to a vote of shareholders of bank mutual 
we cannot assure you that the votes cast by the mhc will be in your best interest as a shareholder

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management of interest rate risk bank mutual s ability to maintain net interest income depends upon earning a higher yield on assets than the rates we pay on deposits and borrowings 
fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact both our level of income and expense recorded on a large portion of our assets and liabilities 
fluctuations in interest rates will also affect the market value of all interest earning assets  other than those which possess a short term to maturity 
interest rate sensitivity is a measure of the difference between amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities which either reprice or mature during a given period of time 
the difference  or the interest rate sensitivity gap  provides an indication of the extent to which our interest rate spread will be affected by changes in interest rates 
see gap analysis below 
due to the nature of our operations  we are not directly subject to foreign currency exchange or commodity price risk 
instead  our real estate loan portfolio  concentrated in wisconsin  is subject to risks associated with the local economy 
we did not engage in any hedging transactions that use derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps and caps during  and in the future  we may  with approval of our board of directors  engage in hedging transactions utilizing derivative instruments 
we seek to coordinate asset and liability decisions so that  under changing interest rate scenarios  earnings will remain within an acceptable range 
the primary objectives of our interest rate management strategy are to maintain earnings and capital within self imposed parameters over a range of possible interest rate environments  coordinate interest rate risk policies and procedures with other elements of our business plan  all within the context of the current business environment and our capital and liquidity requirements  and manage interest rate risk in a manner consistent with the approved guidelines and policies set by our board of directors 
to achieve the objectives of managing interest rate risk  our asset liability committees meet periodically to discuss and monitor the market interest rate environment and provide reports to the board of directors 
these committees one at each bank are comprised of members of their respective senior management 
historically  our lending activities have emphasized one to four family first and second mortgage loans 
our primary source of funds has been deposits and borrowings  consisting primarily of time deposits and borrowings which have substantially shorter terms to maturity than the loan portfolio 
we have employed certain strategies to manage the interest rate risk inherent in the asset liability mix  including emphasizing the origination of adjustable rate and certain year fixed rate mortgage loans for portfolio  and selling certain and year fixed rate mortgage loans and all year fixed rate mortgage loans  maintaining a significant level of investment securities and mortgage related securities with a weighted average life of less than eight years or with interest rates that reprice in less than five years  and managing deposits and borrowings to provide stable funding 
we believe that the frequent repricing of our adjustable rate mortgage loans  the cash flows from our year fixed rate real estate loans  the shorter duration of our consumer loans  and adjustable rate features and shorter durations of our investment securities  reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
gap analysis 
repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring a financial institution s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest bearing assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period exceeds the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that specific time period 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a specific time period exceeds the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within the same period 
during a period of rising interest rates  a financial institution with a negative gap position would be expected  absent the effects of other factors  to experience a greater increase in the costs of its liabilities relative to the yields of its assets and thus a decrease in the institution s net interest income 
an institution with a positive gap position would be expected  absent the effect of other factors  to experience the opposite result 
conversely  during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income while a positive gap would tend to reduce net interest income 
at december   based on the assumptions below  our interest earning assets maturing or repricing within one year exceeded our interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within the same period by million 
this represented a positive cumulative one year interest rate sensitivity gap of  and a ratio of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within one year to interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within one year of the following table presents the amounts of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december   which we anticipate to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown 
the information presented in the following table is based on the following assumptions i investment securities based upon contractual maturities and if applicable  call dates 
ii mortgage related securities based upon an independent outside source for determining cash flows prepayment speeds 
iii loans based upon contractual maturities  repricing date  if applicable  scheduled repayments of principal and projected prepayments of principal based upon our historical experience or anticipated prepayments 
iv deposits based upon contractual maturities and our historical decay rates 
v borrowings based upon the earlier of call date or final maturity  however  as a result of the above market interest rate floor on million of fhlb of chicago borrowings  these borrowings have been reclassified to their final maturity date in we have received indications from fhlb of chicago that they would replace the borrowings even if the borrowings were called 
at december  three to more than one more than within three twelve year to three three years to over months months years five years five years total dollars in thousands interest earning assets loans receivable mortgage loans fixed       adjustable       consumer loans       commercial and industrial loans      interest earning deposits   investment securities      mortgage related securities fixed       adjustable    other interest earning assets   total interest earning assets       interest bearing liabilities deposits interest bearing demand accounts      savings accounts       money market accounts       time deposits      advance payments by borrowers for taxes and insurance   borrowings       total interest bearing liabilities 
      interest rate sensitivity gap       cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap      cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap as a percentage total assets cumulative interest earning assets as a percentage of interest bearing liabilities the methods used in the previous table have some inherent shortcomings 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
certain assets  such as adjustable rate loans  have features which limit changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the loan 
if interest rates change  prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
finally  the ability of borrowers to make payments on their adjustable rate loans may decrease if interest rates increase 
present value of equity in addition to the gap analysis table  we also use simulation models to monitor interest rate risk 
the models report the present value of equity in different interest rate environments  assuming an instantaneous and permanent interest rate shock to all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
the present value of equity is the difference between the present value of expected cash flows of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
the changes in market value of assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates reflect the interest rate sensitivity of those assets and liabilities as their values are derived from the characteristics of the asset or liability ie  fixed rate  adjustable rate  caps  floors relative to the current interest rate environment 
for example  in a rising interest rate environment the fair market value of a fixed rate asset will decline  whereas the fair market value of an adjustable rate asset  depending on its repricing characteristics  may not decline 
increases in the market value of assets will increase the present value of equity whereas decreases in market value of assets will decrease the present value of equity 
conversely  increases in the market value of liabilities will decrease the present value of equity whereas decreases in the market value of liabilities will increase the present value of equity 
the following table presents the estimated present value of equity over a range of interest rate change scenarios at december  the present value ratio shown in the table is the present value of equity as a percent of the present value of total assets in each of the different rate environments 
for purposes of this table  we have made assumptions such as prepayment rates and decay rates similar to those used for the gap analysis table 
present value of equity as percent of present value of equity present value of assets change in dollar dollar percent present value percent interest rates amount change change ratio change basis points dollars in thousands as in the case of the gap analysis table  the methods we used in the previous table have some inherent shortcomings 
this type of modeling requires that we make assumptions which may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
for example  we make assumptions regarding the acceleration rate of the prepayment speeds of higher yielding mortgage loans 
prepayments will accelerate in a falling rate environment and the reverse will occur in a rising rate environment 
we also assume that decay rates on core deposits will accelerate in a rising rate environment and the reverse in a falling rate environment 
the table assumes that we will take no action in response to the changes in interest rates  when in practice rate changes on certain products  such as savings deposits  may lag market changes 
in addition  prepayment estimates and other assumptions within the model are subjective in nature  involve uncertainties  and therefore cannot be determined with precision 
accordingly  although the present value of equity model may provide an estimate of our interest rate risk at a particular point in time  such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in interest rates on our present value of equity
