item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates quaker s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon quaker s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires quaker to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  quaker evaluates its estimates  including those related to customer sales incentives  product returns  bad debts  inventories  property  plant  and equipment  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  financing operations  restructuring  accrued incentive compensation plans  pensions and other postretirement benefits  and contingencies and litigation 
quaker bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
quaker believes the following critical accounting policies describe the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements accounts receivable and inventory reserves and exposures quaker establishes allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of quaker s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
downturns in the overall economic climate may also tend to exacerbate specific customer financial issues 
as part of its terms of trade  quaker may custom manufacture products for certain large customers and or may ship product on a consignment basis 
further  a significant portion of quaker s revenues is derived from sales to customers in the us steel industry  where a number of bankruptcies occurred during recent years 
in   and early  quaker recorded additional provisions for doubtful accounts primarily related to bankruptcies in the us steel industry 
when a bankruptcy occurs  quaker must judge the amount of proceeds  if any  that may ultimately be received through the bankruptcy or liquidation process 
these matters may increase the company s exposure should a bankruptcy occur  and may require writedown or disposal of certain inventory due to its estimated obsolescence or limited marketability 
customer returns of products or disputes may also result in similar issues related to the realizability of recorded accounts receivable or returned inventory 
environmental and litigation reserves accruals for environmental and litigation matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
accrued liabilities are exclusive of claims against third parties and are not discounted 
environmental costs and remediation costs are capitalized if the costs extend the life  increase the capacity or improve the safety or efficiency of the property from the date acquired or constructed  and or mitigate or prevent contamination in the future 
estimates for accruals for environmental matters are based on a variety of potential technical solutions  governmental regulations and other factors  and are subject to a large range of potential costs for remediation and other actions 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in determining the most likely estimate within the range  and the factors determining this judgment may vary over time 
similarly  reserves for litigation and similar matters are based on a range of potential outcomes and require considerable judgment in determining the most probable outcome 
if no amount within the range is considered more probable than any other amount  the company accrues the lowest amount in the range in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
an inactive subsidiary of the company is involved in asbestos litigation 
if the company ever concluded that it was probable it would be liable for any of the obligations of such subsidiary  then it would record the associated liabilities if they can be reasonably estimated 
the company will reassess this situation periodically in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements which appears in item of this report 
realizability of equity investments quaker holds equity investments in various domestic and foreign companies  whereby it has the ability to influence  but not control  the operations of the entity and its future results 
quaker records an investment impairment charge when it believes an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions  poor operating results of underlying investments  or devaluation of foreign currencies could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value 
these factors may result in an impairment charge in the future 
tax exposures and valuation allowances quaker records expenses and liabilities for taxes based on estimates of amounts that will be ultimately determined to be deductible in tax returns filed in various jurisdictions 
the filed tax returns are subject to audit  often several years subsequent to the date of the financial statements 
disputes or disagreements may arise during audits over the timing or validity of certain items or deductions  which may not be resolved for extended periods of time 
quaker establishes reserves for potential tax audit and other exposures as transactions occur and reviews these reserves on a regular basis  however  actual exposures and audit adjustments may vary from these estimates 
quaker also records valuation allowances when necessary to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while quaker has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event quaker were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should quaker determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
us income taxes have not been provided on the undistributed earnings of non us subsidiaries since it is the company s intention to continue to reinvest these earnings in those subsidiaries for working capital and expansion needs 
us and foreign income taxes that would be payable if such earnings were distributed may be lower than the amount computed at the us statutory rate due to the availability of tax credits 
restructuring liabilities restructuring charges may consist of charges for employee severance  rationalization of manufacturing facilities and other items 
quaker has recorded restructuring and other exit costs  including involuntary termination of certain employees  in accordance with the financial accounting standards board s fasb emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
certain of these items  particularly those involving impairment charges for assets to be sold or closed  require significant estimates and assumptions in terms of estimated sale proceeds  date of sale  transaction costs and other matters  and these estimates can change based on market conditions and other factors 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which nullified eitf issue no 
the company is required to adopt the provisions of sfas no 
effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and other intangible assets are evaluated in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
intangible assets  which do not have indefinite lives  are recorded at fair value and amortized over a straight line basis based on third party valuations of the assets 
goodwill and intangible assets  which have indefinite lives  are no longer amortized and required to be assessed at least annually for impairment 
the company compares the assets fair value to its carrying value primarily based on future discounted cash flows in order to determine if an impairment charge is warranted 
the estimates of future cash flows involve considerable management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance 
assumptions used in these forecasts are consistent with internal planning 
the actual cash flows could differ from management s estimates due to changes in business conditions  operating performance  and economic conditions 
the company completed its annual impairment assessment as of the end of the third quarter and no impairment charge was warranted 
postretirement benefits the company provides certain pension and other postretirement benefits to employees and retirees 
independent actuaries  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  perform the required valuations to determine benefit expense and  if necessary  non cash charges to equity for additional minimum pension liabilities 
critical assumptions used in the actuarial valuation include the weighted average discount rate  rates of increase in compensation levels and expected long term rates of return on assets 
if different assumptions were used  additional pension expense or charges to equity may be required 
for  the company incurred such a non cash charge to equity of million 
the company s pension plan year end is november  which serves as the measurement date 
as a result  the company used a weighted average discount rate of 
had the company decreased its weighted average discount rate to  the additional minimum pension liability would have increased approximately million and pension expense would not have materially changed for commencing in  the company lowered its long term rate of return on plan assets from to

the company believes the terms of this lease are no less favorable than the terms it would have obtained from an unaffiliated third party 
as of december   approximately of the site s office space was under lease 
the venture funded the project with a million construction loan the venture  of which approximately million was outstanding as of december  the venture loan was secured in part by a mortgage on the site and certain guarantees executed by certain venture partners other than the company

the increase in volume was primarily due to the inclusion of revenues from the acquisitions of united lubricants corporation and epmar corporation  as well as the purchase of a controlling interest in the company s south african joint venture  which was included in the company s consolidated results effective july  at constant exchange rates and excluding revenue from acquisitions  consolidated net sales increased 
gross profit as a percentage of sales was in compared with in this increase in gross margin percentage was attributable to higher volumes  and lower raw material prices with some product mix changes 
while raw material price decreases and product mix changes have resulted in improved margins to date  the company expects the gross margin to be relatively flat or slightly down 
the company is beginning to see upward pressure on raw material prices particularly in the first half of this pressure is expected to be somewhat offset by mix improvement and continued cost savings initiatives 
however  the duration of higher crude oil prices currently being experienced may negatively impact raw material pricing for a longer period of time

comparison of with consolidated net sales decreased from million in to million in the decline was the net result of a decrease in volume and a improvement in price mix  offset by a negative impact from foreign currency translation 
also  the sale of the us pulp and paper business in may unfavorably impacted the sales comparison by 
the shortfall for the year was mainly attributable to metalworking process chemicals sales declines in the us  europe  and asia pacific regions  primarily due to weak demand from the steel industry  as indicated by bankruptcy filings of two of the company s major us customers 
brazil sales increased in this segment on a local currency basis  but declined as well due to the weakening of the brazilian real against the us dollar 
these declines were partially offset by higher coatings segment revenues despite weakening aircraft production in the fourth quarter of sales from the company s new joint venture q technologies also helped offset the sales decline with its strong performance in sales of its sulfur removal technology to industrial customers

see note of notes to consolidated financial statements which appears in item of this report 
general the company generally does not use financial instruments that expose it to significant risk involving foreign currency transactions  however  the size of non us activities has a significant impact on reported operating results and the attendant net assets

factors that may affect our future results cautionary statements under the private securities litigation reform act of certain information included in this report and other materials filed or to be filed by quaker with the securities and exchange commission as well as information included in oral statements or other written statements made or to be made by us contains or may contain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
these statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts 
we have based these forward looking statements on our current expectations about future events 
these forward looking statements include statements with respect to our beliefs  plans  objectives  goals  expectations  anticipations  intentions  financial condition  results of operations  future performance and business  including 
statements relating to our business strategy  
our current and future results and plans  and 
statements that include the words may  could  should  would  believe  expect  anticipate  estimate  intend  plan or similar expressions 
such statements include information relating to current and future business activities  operational matters  capital spending  and financing sources 
from time to time  oral or written forward looking statements are also included in quaker s periodic reports on forms q and k  press releases and other materials released to the public 
any or all of the forward looking statements in this report  in quaker s annual report to shareholders for and in any other public statements we make may turn out to be wrong 
this can occur as a result of inaccurate assumptions or as a consequence of known or unknown risks and uncertainties 
many factors discussed in this report will be important in determining our future performance 
consequently  actual results may differ materially from those that might be anticipated from our forward looking statements 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
however  any further disclosures made on related subjects in quaker s subsequent reports on forms k  q and k should be consulted 
the risks and uncertainties that could impact the company s future operations and results include  but are not limited to  further downturns in our customers businesses  significant increases in raw material costs  worldwide economic and political conditions  foreign currency fluctuations  the current conflict in iraq  and future security alerts and terrorist attacks such as those that occurred on september  furthermore  the company is subject to the same business cycles as those experienced by steel  automobile  aircraft  appliance  and durable goods manufacturers 
these risks  uncertainties  and possible inaccurate assumptions relevant to our business could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results 
other factors beyond those discussed could also adversely affect us 
this discussion is provided as permitted by the private securities litigation reform act of item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quaker is exposed to the impact of interest rates  foreign currency fluctuations  changes in commodity prices  and credit risk 
interest rate risk 
quaker s exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to its short and long term debt 
most of quaker s long term debt has a fixed interest rate  while its short term debt is negotiated at market rates which can be either fixed or variable 
accordingly  if interest rates rise significantly  the cost of short term debt to quaker will increase 
this can have an adverse effect on quaker  depending on the extent of quaker s short term borrowings 
as of december   quaker had million in short term borrowings 
foreign exchange risk 
a significant portion of quaker s revenues and earnings is generated by its foreign operations 
these foreign operations also hold a significant portion of quaker s assets and liabilities 
all such operations use the local currency as their functional currency 
accordingly  quaker s financial results are affected by risks typical of global business such as currency fluctuations  particularly between the us dollar  the brazilian real  and the eu euro 
as exchange rates vary  quaker s results can be materially affected 
in the past  quaker has used  on a limited basis  forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency transactions and foreign exchange options to reduce exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates 
the amount of any gain or loss on these derivative financial instruments was immaterial 
quaker was not in and is not currently a party to any derivative financial instruments 
therefore  adoption of sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
 did not have a material impact on quaker s operating results or financial position as of december  commodity price risk 
many of the raw materials used by quaker are commodity chemicals  and  therefore  quaker s earnings can be materially adversely affected by market changes in raw material prices 
in certain cases  quaker has entered into fixed price purchase contracts having a term of up to one year 
these contracts provide for protection to quaker if the price for the contracted raw materials rises  however  in certain limited circumstances  quaker will not realize the benefit if such prices decline 
quaker has not been  nor is it currently a party to  any derivative financial instrument relative to commodities 
credit risk 
quaker establishes allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of quaker s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
downturns in the overall economic climate may also tend to exacerbate specific customer financial issues 
a significant portion of quaker s revenues is derived from sales to customers in the us steel industry  where a number of bankruptcies occurred during recent years 
in   and early  quaker recorded additional provisions for doubtful accounts primarily related to bankruptcies in the us steel industry 
when a bankruptcy occurs  quaker must judge the amount of proceeds  if any  that may ultimately be received through the bankruptcy or liquidation process 
in addition  as part of its terms of trade  quaker may custom manufacture products for certain large customers and or may ship product on a consignment basis 
these practices may increase the company s exposure should a bankruptcy occur  and may require writedown or disposal of certain inventory due to its estimated obsolescence or limited marketability 
customer returns of products or disputes may also result in similar issues related to the realizability of recorded accounts receivable or returned inventory
