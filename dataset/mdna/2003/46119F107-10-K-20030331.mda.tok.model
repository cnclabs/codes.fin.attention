item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included in this report on form k 
the discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of these statements include the statements below under factors affecting future operating results 
these forward looking statements are based on our current expectations and entail various risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those set forth below under factors affecting future operating results 
overview we are a leading developer of gene therapy products for the treatment of cancer and other diseases 
our lead product candidate  advexin gene therapy  combines the p gene  one of the most potent members of a group of naturally occurring tumor suppressor genes  which act to protect cells from becoming cancerous  with an adenoviral gene delivery system that we have developed and extensively tested 
we are conducting pivotal phase clinical trials of advexin gene therapy in head and neck cancer 
we have completed a phase clinical trial of advexin gene therapy in non small cell lung cancer and are conducting a phase clinical trial of advexin gene therapy in breast cancer 
we are conducting phase clinical trials  or safety trials  of advexin gene therapy in other types of cancer 
we hold the worldwide rights for pre clinical and clinical development  manufacturing  marketing and commercialization of advexin gene therapy 
advexin gene therapy is designated by the fda as an orphan drug under the orphan drug act  which gives us seven years of marketing exclusivity for advexin gene therapy if approved by the fda 
we are developing additional cancer gene therapy product candidates  including those based on the mda and pten genes  as well as associated vector technologies for delivering the gene based products into target cells 
our ingn product candidate  which combines the mda gene with our proprietary gene delivery system  is undergoing safety testing in a phase clinical trial 
we are investigating other vector technologies for delivering gene based products into targeted cells  specifically those involving replication competent viral therapies in which viruses bind directly to cancer cells  replicate in those cells  and cause those cancer cells to die 
as a supplement to our gene therapy product programs  we are evaluating the development of mebendazole  our first small molecule candidate 
pre clinical trials suggest that mebendazole may also be an effective treatment of cancer 
we own and operate a manufacturing facility that we believe complies with the fda s current good manufacturing practices requirements  commonly known as cgmp requirements 
we have produced advexin gene therapy in this facility for use in our phase  and clinical trials and ingn for use in our phase clinical trials 
we have also produced in a separate facility ingn for use in our phase clinical trials 
since our inception in  we have used our resources primarily to conduct research and development activities  primarily for advexin gene therapy and  to a lesser extent  for other product candidates 
at december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
it is possible we will incur losses in the future that will be greater than cumulative losses incurred in prior years 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
during the year ended december   we used million of cash for operating activities 
it is possible this cash usage rate could increase in future periods as we continue our advexin gene therapy phase clinical trials and expand our research and development of various other gene therapy technologies 
we reduced our workforce by approximately one third in february to lower our cash usage rate 
we believe our existing working capital can fund our operations for the next fifteen to eighteen months 
since our inception  our only significant revenues have been payments from aventis under collaborative research and development agreements for our early stage development work on advexin gene therapy and aventis purchases of advexin gene therapy product we manufactured for its use in later stage clinical trials it previously performed 
we have also earned interest income on cash placed in short term investments 
we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity offerings  debt 
table of contents financings or additional corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements 
we do not know whether such additional financing will be available when needed  or on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
collaborative relationship with aventis in october  we entered into two collaboration agreements with rh ne poulenc rorer pharmaceuticals inc  which ultimately became part of aventis pharma  or aventis  a global pharmaceutical company 
in june  we restructured this collaborative relationship and assumed responsibility for the worldwide development of all p and k ras products  and acquired all marketing and commercialization rights with respect to those products 
we also assumed the control and performance of ongoing clinical trials for p and k ras based products and full responsibility for all pre clinical research and development and clinical trials for new gene therapy products 
in connection with this restructuring and pursuant to a stock purchase agreement executed on june   aventis purchased million of non voting preferred stock from us 
during the quarter ended september   we made a one time payment of million to aventis in consideration for internal costs it incurred in facilitating the transition of control and performance of these clinical trials from aventis to us 
under the restructured p and k ras collaboration agreement  we have the exclusive  worldwide right to market and manufacture the products developed under each of the prior collaboration agreements  as well as any new p or k ras based gene therapy products 
aventis licensed or transferred to us all of its patents covering the manufacture  sale  offering for sale  importation or use of advexin gene therapy and other k ras patents  delivery patents and targeting technologies  as well as all trademarks and goodwill associated with advexin gene therapy 
aventis also agreed  for a period of seven years  not to conduct any activities directed to the development or commercialization of any gene therapy products using the p or k ras genes 
under the prior collaboration agreements  we generally received quarterly payments from aventis for early stage development activities in advance 
we recorded these payments as revenue as we performed the collaboration work and incurred the related expenses 
we recorded as deferred revenue collaborative research and development payments that we received but for which the related expenses had not yet been incurred 
under the restructured collaboration  aventis no longer funds any of our research and development 
prior to the restructuring of the collaboration agreements  aventis provided us with approximately million in the form of funding for early stage development programs and purchases of advexin gene therapy product for later stage clinical development and purchased over million of preferred stock from us 
these purchases of preferred stock were made upon the achievement of the milestones contemplated in our stock purchase agreement with aventis 
we recorded revenue from advexin gene therapy product sales to aventis upon completion of production and delivery and aventis acceptance of the product 
under the restructured collaboration  we no longer receive research funding from or sell advexin gene therapy to aventis 
separate from the collaboration agreement discussed above  we and aventis have a sponsored research agreement  pursuant to which we conduct and aventis funds a phase clinical trial in breast cancer 
critical accounting policies use of estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
short term investments 
short term investments consisted of investments in short term  investment grade securities  which consist primarily of federal and state government obligations  commercial paper and or corporate bonds with various maturity dates not exceeding one year 
all short term investments have been classified as held to maturity and are carried at amortized cost 
at any point in time  amortized costs may be greater or less than fair value 
if investments are sold prior to maturity  we could incur a realized gain or loss 
table of contents based on the fair market value of the investments at the date of sale 
additionally  we could incur future losses on investments if the investment issuer becomes impaired or the investment is downgraded 
research and development costs 
in conducting our pivotal phase clinical trials of advexin gene therapy  we procure services from numerous third party vendors 
the cost of these services constitutes a significant portion of the cost of these trials and of our research and development expenses in general 
these vendors do not necessarily provide us billings for their services on a regular basis and  accordingly  are not a timely source of information to determine the costs we have incurred relative to their services for any given accounting period 
as a result  we make significant accounting estimates as to the amount of costs we have incurred relative to these vendors in each accounting period 
these estimates are based on numerous factors  including  among others  costs set forth in our contracts with these vendors  the period of time over which the vendor will render the services and the rate of enrollment of patients in our clinical trials 
using these estimates  we record expenses and accrued liabilities in each accounting period that we believe fairly represent our obligations to these vendors 
actual results could differ from these estimates resulting in increases or decreases in the amount of expense recorded and the related accrual 
recent accounting pronouncements in june the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
this statement is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  the company does not believe that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on its financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of fasb statement no 
this statement amends fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for an entity that voluntarily changes to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
it also amends the disclosure provisions of that statement to require prominent disclosure about the effects on reported net income of an entity s accounting policy decisions with respect to stock based employee compensation 
finally  this statement amends apb opinion no 
 interim financial reporting  to require disclosure about those effects in interim financial information 
since the company is continuing to account for stock based compensation according to apb  adoption of sfas no 
requires the company to provide prominent disclosures about the affects of fas on reported income loss and will require the company to disclose these affects in the interim financial statements as well 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and revenues contract services  grant and other revenue 
this revenue was million in and  in this increase was due to a higher level of manufacturing and process development contract services activity for third parties in compared to and funding received from aventis in to support a phase clinical trial of advexin gene therapy in breast cancer 
costs and expenses research and development 
research and development expenses  excluding amortization of deferred stock compensation of  in and  in  were million in and million in this increase was primarily due to our assumption in the third quarter of and thereafter of responsibility for conducting  managing and funding the phase and phase clinical trials activities for advexin gene therapy under the terms of the restructuring of our collaboration with aventis 
in  we incurred  of research and development expenses in conjunction with our collaboration and license agreement with virrx 

table of contents general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses  excluding amortization of deferred stock compensation of  in and million in  were million in and million in this increase in was due primarily to the additional cost of providing administrative support for our conduct and management of the phase and phase clinical trials activities for advexin gene therapy  the responsibility for which we assumed in the third quarter of under the terms of the restructuring of our collaboration with aventis 
amortization of deferred compensation 
amortization of deferred stock compensation was million in and million in this decrease was due primarily to deferred compensation for certain options becoming fully amortized during for options currently outstanding  we expect to record amortization expense for deferred compensation of  during and  during  after which time deferred compensation for options currently outstanding becomes fully amortized 
the amount of deferred compensation expense to be recorded in future periods may decrease if unvested options for which deferred compensation has been recorded are subsequently forfeited or may increase if additional options are issued at prices below the deemed fair value of the common stock 
interest income and interest expense 
interest income was  in and million in this decrease was due to lower average cash balances and interest rates during compared to interest expense was  in and  in this decrease was due primarily to lower average principal balances outstanding under mortgage notes payable and capital leases as principal was amortized through normal debt service and lease payments

comparison of six month periods ended december  and revenues revenue from collaborations 
collaborative research and development revenues from aventis were zero for the six month period ended december  and million for the six month period ended december  this decrease was due to the restructuring of our collaboration with aventis  which resulted in our not receiving payments from aventis subsequent to december   for early stage research and development related to p based gene therapy products 
prior to this restructuring  we earned revenue for the early stage research and development we performed under our collaboration agreements with aventis 
revenue from product sales to affiliate 
revenues from product sales to aventis were zero for the six month period ended december  and million for the six month period ended december  this decrease was due to the restructuring of our collaboration with aventis  which resulted in no product sales subsequent to december  the restructuring eliminated our product sales to aventis since we are using the product internally for the future development of advexin gene therapy 
we do not expect to generate revenues from the commercial sale of products in the foreseeable future  and we may never generate revenues from the sale of products 
other revenue 
other revenue was  for the six month period ended december  and  for the six month period ended december  this decrease was due to a decline in amounts earned under research grants from us government agencies and contract manufacturing work for third parties 
costs and expenses cost of product sales 
cost of product sales was zero for the six month period ended december  and million for the six month period ended december  this decrease was due to the restructuring of our collaboration with aventis  which resulted in no product sales subsequent to december   thereby eliminating our cost of product sales 

table of contents research and development 
research and development expenses  excluding amortization of deferred stock compensation of  for the six month period ended december  and  for the six month period ended december   were million for the six month period ended december   and million for the six month period ended december  the increase in compared to was primarily due to our assumption of responsibility for conducting  managing and funding the phase and phase clinical trials activities for advexin gene therapy under the terms of the restructuring of our collaboration with aventis 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses  excluding amortization of deferred stock compensation of  for the six month period ended december  and  for the six month period ended december   were million in and million in the increase in was due primarily to the additional  ongoing costs associated with operating as a public company  subsequent to our initial public offering in october  and the cost of providing administrative support for our conduct and management of the phase and phase clinical trials activities for advexin gene therapy  the responsibility for which we assumed under the terms of the restructuring of our collaboration with aventis 
amortization of deferred compensation 
amortization of deferred stock compensation was  for the six month period ended december  and  for the six month period ended december  the increase in was due primarily to deferred compensation arising from the issuance to an officer in april of an option to purchase shares of our common stock 
interest income and interest expense 
interest income was  for the six month period ended december  and  for the six month period ended december  the increase was primarily due to higher average cash and investment balances in on which interest was earned as a result of our initial public offering in october interest expense was  for the six month period ended december  and  for the six month period ended december  the increase in was primarily due to higher balances under notes payable in compared to as a result of borrowings to finance tenant improvements to our facility related to our sublease of space to m

comparison of fiscal years ended june  and revenues revenue from collaborations 
collaborative research and development revenues from aventis were million in and million in this decrease was primarily due to the restructuring of our collaboration with aventis  which resulted in our not receiving payments from aventis for early stage research and development related to p based gene therapy products subsequent to december  prior to this restructuring  we earned revenue for the early stage research and development we performed under our collaboration agreements with aventis 
revenue from product sales to affiliate 
revenues from product sales to aventis were million in and in this decrease occurred because there were no product sales subsequent to december   due to the restructuring of our collaboration with aventis 
the restructuring eliminated our need to sell product to aventis since we are using the product internally for the future development of advexin gene therapy 
other revenue 
other revenue was  in and  in this increase was due to funding received under research grants from us government agencies and contract manufacturing work for third parties 

table of contents costs and expenses cost of product sales 
cost of product sales was million in and million in this increase was due to a reduction in the number of batches of clinical material in production during the quarter ended december   which resulted in an increase in the amount of the costs of our manufacturing operations that were expensed as incurred instead of capitalized as part of inventory 
this situation did not continue subsequent to december   due to the restructuring of the aventis collaboration that ended sales of clinical materials to aventis  thereby eliminating our cost of product sales 
research and development 
research and development expenses  excluding amortization of deferred stock compensation of  in and zero in  were million in and million in this increase was primarily due to increased activity related to the development of ingn and expenses associated with the restructuring of the aventis collaboration  including a  related to the write off of accounts receivable  inventory and deferred revenue  b million related to the assumption of responsibility for phase and clinical trials for advexin gene therapy and c no costs being capitalized as inventory subsequent to december   as a result of the aventis collaboration restructuring  which eliminated future inventory sales to aventis 
these increases were offset by a decreased level of early stage research and development performed by us prior to the restructuring of the aventis agreement relative to products based on the p gene  as such products had evolved into later stage development  which aventis performed at that time prior to restructuring of that collaboration 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses  excluding amortization of deferred stock compensation of million in and million in  were million in and million in this increase was due primarily to the additional  ongoing costs associated with operating as a public company subsequent to our initial public offering in october and costs associated with the aventis collaboration restructuring 
amortization of deferred compensation 
amortization of deferred stock compensation was million in and million in this decrease was due primarily to including a one time compensation charge related to the accelerated vesting of options held by a member of our board of directors concurrent with the individual s resignation from our board of directors 
interest income and interest expense 
interest income was million in and  in this increase was primarily due to higher average cash and investment balances in on which interest was earned as a result of our initial public offering in october interest expense was  in and  in this increase was primarily due to balances under notes payable to finance our new facilities and equipment being outstanding for all of as compared to being outstanding for only a portion of other income 
other income was  in and zero in this increase was due to being the first year in which we earned rental income related to our sublease to m

liquidity and capital resources we have incurred annual operating losses since our inception  and at december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
since inception through december   we have financed our operations primarily using million of collaborative research and development payments from aventis  million of net proceeds from our initial public offering in october  million of private equity sales to aventis  million of private equity sales  net of offering costs  to others  million of sales of advexin gene therapy product to aventis for use in later stage clinical trials  million in mortgage financing from banks for our facilities  million in leases from commercial leasing companies to acquire equipment pledged as collateral for those leases and million from interest income earned on cash and short and long term investments 
at december   we had cash and short term investments of million  compared with million at december  this decrease was primarily a result of the use of cash to fund our 
table of contents operations 
for at least the next two years  we expect to focus our activities primarily on conducting phase clinical trials  conducting data analysis  preparing regulatory documentation including fda submissions and conducting pre marketing activities for advexin gene therapy 
we also expect to continue our research and development of various other gene therapy technologies 
the majority of our expenditures over this two year period will most likely relate to the clinical trials of advexin gene therapy 
these activities may increase the rate at which we use cash in the future as compared to the cash we used for operating activities during the year ended december  we believe our existing working capital can fund our operations for the next fifteen to eighteen months  although unforeseen events could shorten that time period 
we are taking measures to reduce the amount of cash used in our operating activities 
our existing resources may not be sufficient to support the commercial introduction of any of our product candidates 
we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity offerings  debt financings or additional corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements 
we do not know whether such additional financing will be available when needed  or on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  in general  this increase in cash used was due to our having responsibility for conducting the phase and phase clinical trials for advexin gene therapy throughout whereas we did not have this responsibility in until june of that year 
specifically  the increase in cash used was primarily the result of a higher net loss in compared to  after considering adjustments for depreciation and compensation related to the issuance of stock options  offset primarily by a decrease in receivables and inventory that was smaller in than in due to the primary activity in these accounts in being related to the restructuring of the aventis collaboration in  a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in compared to an increased in these accounts in because the increase included million related to expenses we agreed to pay aventis in connection with the restructuring of the aventis collaboration in  and an increase in deferred revenue in compared to a decrease in this amount in due to a the deferral of the recognition of income under the lease of space to m

anderson cancer center  which was in effect for the entire period but for only a portion of the period and b a decrease in deferred revenue in relating to the earning of revenue on sales of inventory to aventis  an activity that no longer exists due to the restructuring of the aventis collaboration in june net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to net cash provided by investing activities of million for the year ended december  the change in the amounts of purchases and maturities of short term investments compared to was due to a significant portion of our investment activity in the period being in short term investments  followed by a period subsequent to september   during which we concentrated our investments in cash and cash equivalents  which was then followed in the period by more investments in short term securities 
the costs associated with purchases of property and equipment declined in compared to because included costs related to the completion of tenant improvements to the space leased to m 
d 
anderson cancer center  for which there were no similar costs in while we have no obligations at this time to purchase significant amounts of additional property or equipment  our needs may change 
it may be necessary for us to purchase larger amounts of property and equipment to support our clinical programs and other research  development and manufacturing activities 
we may need to obtain debt or lease financing to facilitate such purchases 
if that financing is not available  we may need to use our existing resources to fund those purchases  which could result in a reduction in the cash  cash equivalents and short term investments available to fund operating activities 
net cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december   and net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  this change between periods is due to the period including the receipt of proceeds from the purchase of preferred stock by aventis in connection with the restructuring of our collaboration agreement with them and a note payable used to finance tenant improvements for the lease of space to m 
d 
anderson cancer center  whereas there were no similar events in offsetting these items were higher principal payments under notes payable and capital lease obligations in compared to due to debt service payments on the note payable for tenant 
table of contents improvements being made for all of  but for only a portion of  and a larger portion of debt service payments on all mortgage notes and capital lease obligations applying to principal as the principal balances under these obligations continue to be amortized 
we have an ongoing agreement that began in with virrx  inc to purchase shares of virrx s series a preferred stock 
we purchased  of this stock for cash during we have agreed to purchase an additional  of this stock for cash on the first day of each quarter through january  virrx is required to use the proceeds from these stock sales in accordance with the terms of a collaboration and license agreement between virrx and us for the development of virrx s technologies 
we may unilaterally terminate this collaboration and license agreement with days prior notice after march   which would also terminate our requirement to make any additional stock purchases 
provided the collaboration and license agreement remains in place  we will make additional milestone stock purchases  either for cash or through the issuance of our common stock  upon the completion of phase  phase and phase clinical trials involving technologies licensed under this agreement and we will make a million cash milestone payment to virrx  for which we receive no virrx stock  upon fda approval of a biologics license application involving these technologies 
to the extent we have already made cash milestone payments  we may receive a credit of of the phase clinical trial milestone payments and of the phase clinical trial milestone payments against this million cash milestone payment 
the additional milestone stock purchases and cash payment are not anticipated to be required in the near future 
we have an option to purchase all outstanding shares of virrx at any time until march we have fixed debt service and lease payment obligations under notes payable and capital leases for which the liability is reflected on our balance sheet 
we used the proceeds from these notes payable and leases to finance facilities and equipment 
aggregate payments due under these obligations are as follows in thousands total debt service and lease payments due during the year ending december thereafter total debt service and lease payments less portion representing interest total principal balance at december  principal balance presented on the december  balance sheet as liabilities in these categories current portion of obligations under capital leases and notes payable capital lease obligations  net of current portion notes payable  net of current portion total principal balance at december  we have a fixed rent obligation under a ground lease for the land on which we built our facilities 
since this is an operating lease  there is no liability reflected on our balance sheet for this item  which is in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
we make total annual rent payments of  under this lease which will continue until the expiration of the initial term of this lease in september we have other operating leases expiring in with significantly smaller rent payments that we also account for 
table of contents as operating leases 
future annual rental payments due under all operating leases are as follows in thousands year ending december  thereafter total minimum lease payments under operating leases in the normal course of business  we enter into various long term agreements with vendors to provide services to us 
some of these agreements require up front payment prior to services being rendered  some require periodic monthly payments and some provide for the vendor to bill us for their services as they are rendered 
in substantially all cases  we may cancel these agreements at any time with minimal or no penalty and pay the vendor only for services actually rendered 
regardless of the timing of the payments under these agreements  we record the expenses incurred in the periods in which the services are rendered 
we pay consulting fees of approximately  per annum to a company that is owned by the chairman of our board of directors and that formerly employed one of our directors 
we are obligated to continue paying this fee until we terminate the services of that company at our option 
we have a consulting agreement with an individual primarily responsible for the creation of the technology upon which advexin gene therapy is based  who is also a stockholder of ours 
this agreement provides for payments of approximately  per annum until september   and  per annum thereafter through the end of its term on september   with such future payments subject to adjustment for inflation 
we may terminate this agreement at our option upon one year s advance notice 
had we terminated this agreement as of december   we would have been obligated to make final payments to this individual totaling comparison of six month periods ended december  and at december   we had cash and short term investments of approximately million  compared with million at december  net cash used by operating activities was million and million for the six month period ended december  and the six month period ended december   respectively 
this increase in cash used by operating activities was primarily due to a higher net loss from operations and payment of accrued liabilities  offset partially by a smaller increase in accounts receivable and the absence of a decrease in inventory during as compared to the payment of accrued liabilities was higher due to the increased level of activity associates with our phase clinical trials of advexin gene therapy 
the smaller increase in accounts receivable and the absence of the decrease in inventory was due to the elimination of sales of advexin gene therapy to aventis as a result of the restructuring of our collaboration with them 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for the six month period ended december   and net cash used in investing activities was million for the six month period ended december  during the six month period ended december   we invested a portion of our cash in short term investments with maturities in excess of days 
during the six month period ended december   we modified our investment policy and concentrated our investing activities in instruments with maturities shorter than days 
this change in policy resulted in a decrease in cash used by investing activities 
we also purchased less property and equipment in the period compared to the period since the period included our activities related to the finish out of a portion of our facilities for lease to m

table of contents net cash provided by financing activities was million for the six month period ended december  and million for the six month period ended december  this decline was primarily due to the proceeds from our initial public offering of common stock in october being greater than the proceeds from our sale of preferred stock to aventis in july  and a decline in the amount of new notes payable in compared to due to the leasehold improvements related to our sublease of space to m

anderson cancer center being completed and all financing related thereto in place in early at december   we had million outstanding under notes payable for our facilities and million outstanding under capital leases to finance the purchase of equipment 
comparison of fiscal years ended june  and at june   we had cash and short term investments of approximately million  compared with million at june  net cash used by operating activities was million and million for the years ended june  and  respectively 
this increase in cash used by operating activities was primarily due to a higher net loss from operations and a decrease in deferred revenue  offset partially by an increase in accrued liabilities 
deferred revenue decreased as a result of no longer receiving collaborative research revenue from aventis as a result of the restructuring of our collaboration agreement with them 
the increase in accrued liabilities arose from our assumption of responsibility for the phase clinical trials for advexin gene therapy under that collaboration restructuring 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended june   and million for the year ended june  this change is primarily due to a higher level of purchases of short term investments due to the availability of funds from our initial public offering in october net cash provided by financing activities was million and million for the years ended june  and  respectively 
this was primarily due to the receipt of proceeds from our initial public offering of common stock in october offset by a decline in the amount of new notes payable and capital lease borrowings since our new facilities and related equipment were complete  outfitted and initially financed in at june   we had million outstanding under notes payable for our facilities and million outstanding under capital leases to finance the purchase of equipment

factors affecting future operating results we may encounter delays or difficulties in clinical trials for our product candidates  which may delay or preclude regulatory approval of some or all of our product candidates 
in order to commercialize our product candidates  we must obtain regulatory approvals 
satisfaction of regulatory requirements typically takes many years  and involves compliance with requirements covering research and development  testing  manufacturing  quality control  labeling and promotion of drugs for human use 
to obtain regulatory approvals  we must  among other requirements  complete clinical trials demonstrating that our product candidates are safe and effective for a particular cancer type or other disease 
we are conducting phase clinical trials of our lead product candidate  advexin gene therapy  for the treatment of head and neck cancer  have completed a phase clinical trial of advexin gene therapy for the treatment of non small cell lung cancer  are conducting a phase clinical trial of advexin gene therapy for the treatment of breast cancer and are conducting several phase and phase clinical trials of advexin gene therapy for other cancer types 
current or future clinical trials may demonstrate that advexin gene therapy is neither safe nor effective 

table of contents while we are conducting a phase clinical trial of ingn  a product candidate based on the mda gene  our most significant clinical trial activity and experience has been with advexin gene therapy 
we will need to continue conducting significant research and animal testing  referred to as pre clinical testing  to support performing clinical trials for our other gene therapy product candidates 
it will take us many years to complete pre clinical testing and clinical trials  and failure could occur at any stage of testing 
current or future clinical trials may demonstrate that ingn or our other product candidates are neither safe nor effective 
any delays or difficulties we encounter in our pre clinical research and clinical trials  in particular the phase clinical trials of advexin gene therapy for the treatment of head and neck cancer  may delay or preclude regulatory approval 
our product development costs will increase if we experience delays in testing or regulatory approvals or if we need to perform more or larger clinical trials than planned 
any delay or preclusion could also delay or preclude the commercialization of advexin gene therapy or any other product candidates 
in addition  we or the fda might delay or halt any of our clinical trials of a product candidate at any time for various reasons  including the failure of the product candidate to be more effective than current therapies  the presence of unforeseen adverse side effects of a product candidate  including its delivery system  a longer than expected time required to determine whether or not a product candidate is effective  the death of patients during a clinical trial  even though the product candidate may not have caused those deaths  the failure to enroll a sufficient number of patients in our clinical trials  the inability to produce sufficient quantities of a product candidate to complete the trials  or the inability to commit the necessary resources to fund the clinical trials 
we may encounter delays or rejections in the regulatory approval process because of additional government regulation from future legislation or administrative action or changes in fda policy during the period of product development  clinical trials and fda regulatory review 
failure to comply with applicable fda or other applicable regulatory requirements may result in criminal prosecution  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production or injunction  as well as other regulatory action against our product candidates or us 
outside the united states  our ability to market a product is contingent upon receiving clearances from the appropriate regulatory authorities 
this foreign regulatory approval process includes all of the risks associated with fda clearance described above 
we have a history of operating losses and expect to incur significant additional operating losses 
we have generated operating losses since we began operations in june as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we expect to incur substantial additional operating expenses and losses over the next several years as our research  development  pre clinical testing and clinical trial activities increase 
we have no products that have generated any commercial revenue 
presently  we earn minimal revenue from contract services activities  grants  interest income and rent from the lease of a portion of our facilities to m

anderson cancer center 
prior to december   we earned revenue from aventis under collaborative agreements for research and development and sales of advexin gene therapy for use in aventis clinical trials  which are revenues we no longer receive 
we do not expect to generate revenues from the commercial sale of products in the foreseeable future  and we may never generate revenues from the commercial sale of products 
if we continue to incur operating losses for a period longer than we anticipate and fail to obtain the capital necessary to fund our operations  we will be unable to advance our development program and complete our clinical trials 

table of contents developing a new drug and conducting clinical trials for multiple disease indications is expensive 
we expect that we will fund our operations over the next fifteen to eighteen months with our current working capital  resulting primarily from the net proceeds from our initial public offering in october  the sale of series a non voting convertible preferred stock to aventis in june  income from contract services and research grants  debt financing of equipment acquisitions  the lease of a portion of our facilities to m

anderson cancer center and interest on invested funds 
we may need to raise additional capital sooner  however  due to a number of factors  including an acceleration of the number  size or complexity of our clinical trials  slower than expected progress in developing advexin gene therapy  ingn or other product candidates  higher than expected costs to obtain regulatory approvals  higher than expected costs to pursue our intellectual property strategy  higher than expected costs to further develop our manufacturing capability  higher than expected costs to develop our sales and marketing capability  and slower than expected progress in reducing our operating costs 
we do not know whether additional financing will be available when needed  or on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
we may need to raise any necessary funds through public or private equity offerings  debt financings or additional corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements 
to the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities  our stockholders will experience dilution 
if we raise funds through debt financings  we may become subject to restrictive covenants 
to the extent that we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements  we may be required to relinquish some rights to our technologies or product candidates  or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us 
if we cannot maintain our corporate and academic arrangements and enter into new arrangements  product development could be delayed 
our strategy for the research  development and commercialization of our product candidates may require us to enter into contractual arrangements with corporate collaborators  academic institutions and others 
we have entered into sponsored research and or collaborative arrangements with several entities  including m 
d 
anderson cancer center  icrt  the national cancer institute  virrx and corixa corporation 
our success depends upon our collaborative partners performing their responsibilities under these arrangements 
we cannot control the amount and timing of resources our collaborative partners devote to our research and testing programs or product candidates  which can vary because of factors unrelated to such programs or product candidates 
these relationships may in some cases be terminated at the discretion of our collaborative partners with only limited notice to us 
we may not be able to maintain our existing arrangements  enter into new arrangements or negotiate current or new arrangements on acceptable terms  if at all 
some of our collaborative partners may also be researching competing technologies independently from us to treat the diseases targeted by our collaborative programs 
if we are not able to create effective collaborative marketing relationships  we may be unable to market advexin gene therapy successfully or in a cost effective manner 
to effectively market our products  we will need to develop sales  marketing and distribution capabilities 
in order to develop or otherwise obtain these capabilities  we may have to enter into marketing  distribution or other similar arrangements with third parties in order to successfully sell  market and distribute our products 
to the extent that we enter into any such arrangements with third parties  our product revenues are likely to be lower than if we directly marketed and sold our products  and any revenues we receive will depend upon the efforts of such third parties 
we have no experience in marketing or selling pharmaceutical products and we currently have no sales  marketing or distribution capability 
we may be unable to develop sufficient sales  marketing and distribution capabilities to successfully commercialize our products 

table of contents serious unwanted side effects attributable to gene therapy may result in governmental authorities imposing additional regulatory requirements or a negative public perception of our products 
serious unwanted side effects attributable to treatment  which physicians classify as treatment related adverse events  occurring in the field of gene therapy may result in greater governmental regulation and negative public perception of our product candidates  as well as potential regulatory delays relating to the testing or approval of our product candidates 
the fda recently placed a clinical hold on gene therapy clinical trials using retroviral vectors to transduce hematopoietic stem cells after two participants in such a trial for the x linked form of severe combined immune deficiency disease x scid being conducted in europe developed what appeared to be a leukemia like illness 
this clinical hold requires a case by case review of the use of retroviral vectors in these trials 
we are not developing products using the process used in those clinical trials  and we do not use retroviral vectors in our ongoing clinical trials 
we have received no communications from the fda to indicate this clinical hold will affect our clinical trials  and we anticipate no future negative effects on us from this event 
our pharmacovigilance department monitors every patient in our clinical trials for safety and reports all side effects to the fda and the national institutes of health according to applicable regulations 
we have witnessed no adverse effects in our clinical trials that even remotely resemble what occurred in the x scid trial 
due to the fundamental differences between retrovirus vectors and the adenovirus vector employed in advexin gene therapy  we believe the likelihood of our encountering an event such as that experienced in the x scid trial is remote 
the united states senate has held hearings concerning the adequacy of regulatory oversight of gene therapy clinical trials  as well as the adequacy of research subject education and protection in clinical research in general  and to determine whether additional legislation is required to protect healthy volunteers and patients who participate in such clinical trials 
the recombinant dna advisory committee  or rac  which acts as an advisory body to the national institutes of health  or nih  has expanded its public role in evaluating important public and ethical issues in gene therapy clinical trials 
implementation of any additional review and reporting procedures or other additional regulatory measures could increase the costs of or prolong our product development efforts or clinical trials 
implementation of any additional review and reporting procedures or other additional regulatory measures could increase the costs of or prolong our product development efforts or clinical trials 
following routine procedure  we report to the fda and other regulatory agencies serious adverse events that we believe may be reasonably related to our gene therapy treatment 
such serious adverse events  whether treatment related or not  could result in negative public perception of our gene therapy treatment and require additional regulatory review or measures  which could increase the cost of or prolong our clinical trials 
to date no governmental authority has approved any gene therapy product for sale in the united states or internationally 
the commercial success of our products will depend in part on public acceptance of the use of gene therapies  which are a new type of disease treatment for the prevention or treatment of human diseases 
public attitudes may be influenced by claims that gene therapy is unsafe  and gene therapy may not gain the acceptance of the public or the medical community 
negative public reaction to gene therapy could also result in greater government regulation and stricter clinical trial oversight 
if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights  our competitors may be able to take advantage of our research and development efforts to develop competing drugs 
our commercial success will depend in part on obtaining patent protection for our products and other technologies and successfully defending these patents against third party challenges 
our patent position  like that of other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  is highly uncertain 
one uncertainty is that the united states patent and trademark office  or pto  or the courts  may deny or significantly narrow claims made under patents or patent applications 
this is particularly true for patent applications or patents that concern biotechnology and pharmaceutical technologies  such as ours  since the pto and the courts often consider these technologies to involve unpredictable sciences 
another uncertainty is that any patents that may be issued or licensed to us may not provide any competitive advantage to us and they may be successfully challenged  invalidated or circumvented in the future 
in addition  our competitors  many of which have substantial resources and have made significant investments in competing technologies  may seek to apply for 
table of contents and obtain patents that will prevent  limit or interfere with our ability to make  use and sell our potential products either in the united states or in international markets 
our ability to develop and protect a competitive position based on our biotechnological innovations  innovations involving genes  gene therapy  viruses for delivering the genes to cells  formulations  gene therapy delivery systems that do not involve viruses  and the like  is particularly uncertain 
due to the unpredictability of the biotechnological sciences  the pto  as well as patent offices in other jurisdictions  has often required that patent applications concerning biotechnology related inventions be limited or narrowed substantially to cover only the specific innovations exemplified in the patent application  thereby limiting their scope of protection against competitive challenges 
similarly  courts have invalidated or significantly narrowed many key patents in the biotechnology industry 
thus  even if we are able to obtain patents that cover commercially significant innovations  our patents may not be upheld or our patents may be substantially narrowed 
through our exclusive license from the university of texas system for technology developed at m 
d 
anderson cancer center  we have obtained and are currently seeking further patent protection for adenoviral p  including advexin gene therapy  and its use in cancer therapy 
further  the pto issued us a united states patent for our adenovirus production technology 
we also control  through licensing arrangements  four issued united states patents for combination therapy involving the p gene and conventional chemotherapy or radiation  one issued united states patent covering the use of adenoviral p in cancer therapy  an issued united states patent covering adenoviral p as a product and an issued united states patent covering the core dna of adenoviral p our competitors may challenge the validity of one or more of our patents in the courts or through an administrative procedure known as an interference 
the courts or the pto may not uphold the validity of our patents  we may not prevail in such interference proceedings regarding our patents and none of our patents may give us a competitive advantage 
we have been notified by the european patent office  or epo  that schering plough has filed an opposition against the issuance of our european patent directed to combination therapy with p and conventional chemotherapy and or radiation 
an opposition is an administrative proceeding instituted by a third party and conducted by the epo to determine whether a patent should be maintained or revoked in part or in whole  based on evidence brought forth by the party opposing the patent 
we expect that the epo will hold an initial oral proceeding to determine whether the patent should be maintained in late or early resolution of this opposition will require that we expend time  effort and money 
if the party opposing the patent ultimately prevails in having our european patent revoked in whole or in part then the scope of our protection for our product in europe will be reduced 
we would not expect  however  such a result to have a significant impact on our commercialization efforts in europe 
third party claims of infringement of intellectual property could require us to spend time and money to address the claims and could limit our intellectual property rights 
the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry has been characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights  and companies have employed intellectual property litigation to gain a competitive advantage 
we are aware of a number of issued patents and patent applications that relate to gene therapy  the treatment of cancer and the use of the p and other tumor suppressor genes 
schering plough corporation  including its subsidiary canji  inc  controls various united states patent applications and a european patent and applications  some of which are directed to therapy using the p gene  and others to adenoviruses that contain the p gene  or adenoviral p  and to methods for carrying out therapy using adenoviral p in addition  canji controls an issued united states patent and its international counterparts  including a european patent  involving a method of treating mammalian cancer cells lacking normal p protein by introducing a p gene into the cancer cell 
while we believe that our potential products do not infringe any valid claim of the canji p patents  canji or schering plough could assert a claim against us 
we may also become subject to infringement claims or litigation arising out of other patents and pending applications of our competitors  if they issue  or additional interference proceedings declared by the pto to determine the priority of inventions 
the defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits  pto interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings are costly and time consuming to pursue  and their outcome is uncertain 
litigation may be 
table of contents necessary to enforce our issued patents  to protect our trade secrets and know how or to determine the enforceability  scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
an adverse determination in litigation or interference proceedings to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liabilities  require us to obtain licenses from third parties  or restrict or prevent us from selling our products in certain markets 
although patent and intellectual property disputes are often settled through licensing or similar arrangements  costs associated with such arrangements may be substantial and could include ongoing royalties 
furthermore  the necessary licenses may not be available to us on satisfactory terms  if at all 
in particular  if we were found to infringe a valid claim of the canji p issued united states patent  our business could be materially harmed 
we are currently involved in opposing three european patents in proceedings before the epo  in which we are seeking to have the epo revoke three different european patents owned or controlled by canji 
these european patents relate to the use of a p gene  or the use of tumor suppressor genes  in the preparation of therapeutic products 
in one opposition involving a european patent directed to the use of a tumor suppressor gene  the epo revoked the european patent in its entirety 
canji has appealed this revocation 
in the second opposition  involving a patent directed to therapeutic and other applications of the p gene that is owned by johns hopkins and  we understand  controlled by schering plough  the epo recently revoked the patent in its entirety 
the patent owner will have an opportunity to appeal this decision 
in a third case involving the use of a p gene  the european patent at issue was upheld following an initial hearing 
a second hearing to determine whether this patent should be revoked will be upcoming 
if we do not ultimately prevail in one or more of these oppositions  our competitors could seek to assert by means of litigation any patent surviving opposition against european commercial activities involving our potential products 
if our competitors are successful in any such litigation  it could have a significant detrimental effect on our ability to commercialize our potential commercial products in europe 
competition and technological change may make our product candidates and technologies less attractive or obsolete 
we compete with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  including canji  inc  genvec  inc  vical incorporated and onyx pharmaceuticals  inc  which are pursuing other forms of treatment for the diseases advexin gene therapy and our other product candidates target 
we also may face competition from companies that may develop internally or acquire competing technology from universities and other research institutions 
as these companies develop their technologies  they may develop competitive positions that may prevent or limit our product commercialization efforts 
some of our competitors are established companies with greater financial and other resources than ours 
other companies may succeed in developing products earlier than we do  obtaining fda approval for products more rapidly than we do or developing products that are more effective than our product candidates 
while we will seek to expand our technological capabilities to remain competitive  research and development by others may render our technology or product candidates obsolete or non competitive or result in treatments or cures superior to any therapy developed by us 
even if we receive regulatory approval to market advexin gene therapy  ingn or other product candidates  we may not be able to commercialize them profitably 
our profitability will depend on the market s acceptance of advexin gene therapy  ingn and our other product candidates 
the commercial success of our product candidates will depend on whether they are more effective than alternative treatments  their side effects are acceptable to patients and doctors  we produce and sell them at a profit  and we market advexin gene therapy  ingn and other product candidates effectively 

table of contents if we are unable to manufacture our products in sufficient quantities or obtain regulatory approvals for our manufacturing facility  or if our manufacturing process is found to infringe a valid patented process of another company  then we may be unable to meet demand for our products and lose potential revenues 
the completion of our clinical trials and commercialization of our product candidates requires access to  or development of  facilities to manufacture a sufficient supply of our product candidates 
we use a manufacturing facility in houston  texas  which we constructed and own  to manufacture advexin gene therapy  ingn and other product candidates for currently planned clinical trials 
this facility will be used for the initial commercial launch of advexin gene therapy 
we have no experience manufacturing advexin gene therapy  ingn or any other product candidates in the volumes that would be necessary to support commercial sales 
if we are unable to manufacture our product candidates in clinical or  when necessary  commercial quantities  then we will need to rely on third party manufacturers to produce our products for clinical and commercial purposes 
these third party manufacturers must receive fda approval before they can produce clinical material or commercial product 
our products may be in competition with other products for access to these facilities and may be subject to delays in manufacture if third parties give other products greater priority than ours 
in addition  we may not be able to enter into any necessary third party manufacturing arrangements on acceptable terms 
there are very few contract manufacturers who currently have the capability to produce advexin gene therapy  ingn or our other product candidates  and the inability of any of these contract manufacturers to deliver our required quantities of product candidates timely and at commercially reasonable prices would negatively affect our operations 
before we can begin commercially manufacturing advexin gene therapy  ingn or any other product candidate  we must obtain regulatory approval of our manufacturing facility and process 
manufacturing of our product candidates for clinical and commercial purposes must comply with cgmp and foreign regulatory requirements 
the cgmp requirements govern quality control and documentation policies and procedures 
in complying with cgmp and foreign regulatory requirements  we will be obligated to expend time  money and effort in production  record keeping and quality control to assure that the product meets applicable specifications and other requirements 
we must also pass a pre approval inspection prior to fda approval 
our current manufacturing facilities have not yet been subject to an fda or other regulatory inspection 
failure to pass a pre approval inspection may significantly delay fda approval of our products 
if we fail to comply with these requirements  we would be subject to possible regulatory action and may be limited in the jurisdictions in which we are permitted to sell our products 
further  the fda and foreign regulatory authorities have the authority to perform unannounced periodic inspections of our manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with cgmp and foreign regulatory requirements 
our facility in houston  texas is our only manufacturing facility 
if this facility were to incur significant damage or destruction  then our ability to manufacture advexin gene therapy or any other product candidates would be significantly hampered and we would incur delays in our pre clinical testing  clinical trials and commercialization efforts 
canji controls a united states patent and corresponding international applications  including a european counterpart  relating to the purification of viral or adenoviral compositions 
while we believe that our manufacturing process does not infringe upon this patent  canji could still assert a claim against us 
we may also become subject to infringement claims or litigation if our manufacturing process infringes upon other patents 
the defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits and related legal and administrative proceedings are costly and time consuming to pursue  and their outcome is uncertain 
we rely on only one supplier for some of our manufacturing materials 
any problems experienced by any such supplier could negatively affect our operations 
we rely on third party suppliers for some of the materials used in the manufacturing of advexin gene therapy  ingn and our other product candidates 
some of these materials are available from only one supplier or vendor 
any significant problem that one of our sole source suppliers experiences could result in a delay or interruption in the supply of materials to us until that supplier cures the problem or until we locate an alternative source of supply 
any delay or interruption would likely lead to a delay or interruption in our manufacturing operations  which could negatively affect our operations 

table of contents the cellcube tm module bioreactor  which corning acton  ma manufactures  and benzonase  which em industries hawthorne  ny manufactures  are currently available only from these suppliers 
any significant interruption in the supply of either of these items would require a material change in our manufacturing process 
we maintain inventories of these items  but we do not have a supply agreement with either manufacturer 
if product liability lawsuits are successfully brought against us  we may incur substantial damages and demand for the products may be reduced 
the testing and marketing of medical products is subject to an inherent risk of product liability claims 
regardless of their merit or eventual outcome  product liability claims may result in decreased demand for our product candidates  injury to our reputation and significant media attention  withdrawal of clinical trial volunteers  costs of litigation  and substantial monetary awards to plaintiffs 
we currently maintain product liability insurance with coverage of million per occurrence with a million annual aggregate limit 
this coverage may not be sufficient to protect us fully against product liability claims 
we intend to expand our product liability insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products if we obtain marketing approval for any of our product candidates 
our inability to obtain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost to protect against product liability claims could prevent or limit the commercialization of our products 
we use hazardous materials in our business  and any claims relating to improper handling  storage or disposal of these materials could harm our business 
our business involves the use of a broad range of hazardous chemicals and materials 
environmental laws impose stringent civil and criminal penalties for improper handling  disposal and storage of these materials 
in addition  in the event of an improper or unauthorized release of  or exposure of individuals to  hazardous materials  we could be subject to civil damages due to personal injury or property damage caused by the release or exposure 
a failure to comply with environmental laws could result in fines and the revocation of environmental permits  which could prevent us from conducting our business 
our stock price may fluctuate substantially 
the market price for our common stock will be affected by a number of factors  including the announcement of new products or services by us or our competitors  quarterly variations in our or our competitors results of operations  failure to achieve operating results projected by securities analysts  changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts  developments in our industry  and general market conditions and other factors  including factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors 
in addition  stock prices for many companies in the technology and emerging growth sectors have experienced wide fluctuations that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
many factors may have a significant adverse effect on the market price of our common stock  including results of our pre clinical and clinical trials  announcement of technological innovations or new commercial products by us or our competitors

any acquisition we might make may be costly and difficult to integrate  may divert management resources or dilute stockholder value 
as part of our business strategy  we may acquire assets or businesses principally relating to or complementary to our current operations  and we have in the past evaluated and discussed such opportunities with interested parties 
any acquisitions that we undertake will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in business acquisitions 
these risks include  among other things potential exposure to unknown liabilities of acquired companies  the difficulty and expense of assimilating the operations and personnel of acquired businesses  diversion of management time and attention and other resources  loss of key employees and customers as a result of changes in management  the incurrence of amortization expenses  and possible dilution to our stockholders 
in addition  geographic distances may make the integration of businesses more difficult 
we may not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with any acquisitions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our fixed rate long term debt and short term investments in investment grade securities  which consist primarily of federal and state government obligations  commercial paper and corporate bonds 
investments are classified as held to maturity and are carried at amortized costs 
we do not hedge interest rate exposure or invest in derivative securities 
a hypothetical basis point decrease in the interest rates of our investments at the investment balances as of december  would decrease our interest income by approximately  at december   the fair value of our fixed rate debt approximated its carrying value based upon discounted future cash flows using current market prices
