item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our objective is to provide water services in areas where the supply of potable water is scarce and where the use of ro technology to produce potable water is economically feasible 
by focusing on this market  we believe that we can provide a superior financial return to our investors 
to increase share value and maintain dividend payouts in accordance with current company policy  we need to expand our revenues by developing new business opportunities both within our current service areas  and in new areas 
we need to maintain our high operating efficiencies by adhering to our strict equipment maintenance and water loss mitigation programs in order to achieve gross profit margins between and 
we further believe that many caribbean basin and adjacent countries  while being water scarce  also present opportunities for operation of our plants in limited regulatory settings which are less restrictive than the highly regulated markets of north america  which promotes cost effective operation of our equipment 
our business operations and activities after our acquisitions in february  are conducted in five countries the cayman islands  belize  barbados  the british virgin islands and the bahamas 
the recent acquisitions increase our daily water production capacity in the cayman islands and the bahamas and expand our geographic presence to include barbados and the british virgin islands 
operations before and after recent acquisitions operations before recent acquisitions operations after recent acquisitions location plants capacity location plants capacity cayman islands cayman islands bahamas bahamas belize belize barbados british virgin islands total total million us gallons of water per day 
cayman islands we have been operating our business on grand cayman island since and have been using ro technology to convert seawater to potable water since there is a limited natural supply of fresh water on the cayman islands 
we currently have an exclusive license from the cayman islands government to process potable water from seawater and then sell and distribute that water by pipeline to seven mile beach and west bay  grand cayman 
prior to our acquisition of ocean conversion cayman limited  our cayman islands operations consisted of three reverse osmosis seawater conversion plants in grand cayman the governor s harbour plant  the west bay plant and the britannia plant 
the combined capacity of these plants is million us gallons per day 
our pipeline system in the cayman islands covers the seven mile beach and west bay areas of grand cayman and consists of approximately miles of polyvinyl chloride pipe 
sales in grand cayman are made within our licensed area to approximately  customers 
during  we supplied approximately million us gallons of water in grand cayman 
as a result of our recent acquisition of ocean conversion cayman limited  we now operate an additional three reverse osmosis seawater conversion plants in grand cayman with a total installed capacity of million us gallons per day 
ocean conversion cayman limited provides water on a take or pay basis to the water authority cayman  a government regulatory agency  and to us under various licenses and agreements 
revenues of ocean conversion cayman limited were million for the year ended december  desalco limited provides management  engineering and construction services for desalination projects and is the exclusive agent for sales of dweer tm energy recovery systems for desalination plants in the caribbean basin for the next seven years 
desalco limited  which is recognized by suppliers as an original equipment manufacturer  also acts as the purchasing agent for all companies affiliated with our company 
desalco limited s revenues were million for the year ended december  belize our belize operation  which was acquired on july   consists of one reverse osmosis seawater conversion plant on ambergris caye  belize  central america  which is capable of producing  us gallons per day 
we sell water to one customer  belize water services limited  which then distributes the water through its own distribution system to residential  commercial and tourist properties on ambergris caye 
during  we supplied approximately million us gallons of water in belize 
revenues of our wholly owned subsidiary  belize water limited  were million for the year ended december  bahamas prior to our acquisition of operational control of waterfields company limited  our bahamas operations consisted of one reverse osmosis seawater conversion plant in bimini  bahamas 
our bimini plant is capable of producing  us gallons per day and provides potable water to bimini sands resort and to the bimini beach hotel 
during  we supplied approximately five million us gallons of water in the bahamas and revenues were million for the year ended december  we expect the demand for water from our plant in bimini to increase as additional phases are completed at the bimini sands development 
as a result of our acquisition of waterfields company limited  we acquired an additional reverse osmosis seawater conversion plant in the bahamas 
waterfields produces potable water from one reverse osmosis seawater conversion plant in new providence and has a total installed capacity of million us gallons per day 
waterfields company limited provides water on a take or pay basis to the water and sewerage corporation of the bahamas under a long term build  own and operate supply agreement 
revenues for waterfields company limited were million for the year ended december  barbados the recently acquired barbados operation consists of one reverse osmosis seawater conversion plant with a capacity of million us gallons per day which is operated by desalco barbados ltd  the wholly owned subsidiary of desalco limited 
the plant provides water to the sandy lane resort  and during  supplied approximately million us gallons 
desalco barbados ltd 
had revenues of million for the year ended december british virgin islands we recently entered the market in the british virgin islands when our wholly owned subsidiary  desalco limited acquired operational control and shared management control of ocean conversion bvi ltd  which produces potable water from one reverse osmosis seawater conversion plant in tortola  british virgin islands 
the plant has a total installed capacity of million us gallons per day 
ocean conversion bvi ltd 
provides water on a take or pay basis to the department of water and sewerage of the ministry of communications and works under an agreement with the government of the british virgin islands 
ocean conversion bvi ltd 
s revenues were million for the year ended december our operations under the license in the cayman islands our exclusive operational license was issued to us by the cayman islands government under the water production and supply law of the license terminates  unless further renewed  on july  two years prior to the expiration of the license  we have the right to negotiate with the government to extend the license for an additional term 
unless we are in default under the license  the government may not grant a license to any other party without first offering the license to us on terms that are no less favorable than those which the government offers to a third party 
we must provide  within our licensed area  any requested piped water service which  in the opinion of the executive council of the cayman islands government  is commercially feasible 
where supply is not considered commercially feasible  we may require the potential customer to contribute toward the capital costs of pipe laying advances in aid of construction 
we then repay these advances to the customer  without interest  by way of a discount of on future billings for water sales until this advance in aid of construction has been repaid 
we have been installing additional pipeline when we consider it to be commercially feasible  and the cayman islands government has never objected to our determination regarding commercial feasibility 
under the license  we pay a royalty to the government of of our gross us gallon potable water sales revenue 
the base selling price of water under the license presently varies between and per  us gallons  depending upon the type and location of the customer and the monthly volume of water purchased 
the license provides for an automatic adjustment for inflation deflation on an annual basis  subject to temporary limited exceptions  and an automatic adjustment for the cost of electricity on a monthly basis 
the water authority cayman  on behalf of government  reviews and approves the calculations of the price adjustments for inflation and electricity costs 
if we want to increase our prices for any reason other than inflation  we have to request prior approval of the executive council of the cayman islands government 
if the parties fail to agree  the matter is referred to arbitration 
the last price increase that we requested  other than automatic inflation adjustments since  was granted in full in june demand for water in the cayman islands in the past  demand on our pipeline distribution has varied throughout the year 
however  an increase in year round tourism in recent years has created more uniform demand for water throughout the year 
demand depends upon the number of tourists visiting the cayman islands and the amount of rainfall during any particular time of the year 
in general  of tourists come from the united states 
our operating results in any particular quarter are not indicative of the results to be expected for the full year 
the table below lists the total volume of water we supplied on a quarterly basis for the five years ended december  to all of our customers in thousands of us gallons first quarter      second quarter      third quarter      fourth quarter      total      our operations under the contract in belize we have entered into a contract with bwsl to supply a minimum of  us gallons of water per day to bwsl expiring in at the expiry of the contract  bwsl may at its option extend the term of the agreement or purchase the plant outright 
the base price of water supplied  and adjustments thereto  are determined by the terms of the contract  which provides for adjustments based upon the movement in the government price indices specified in the contract  as well as  monthly adjustments for changes in the cost of diesel fuel and electricity 
we bill on a monthly basis based on metered consumption 
receivables are due within days after the billing date 
interest of per year is charged on any delayed payments 
as at the date of this annual report  bwsl is current on its outstanding balance 
we had no bad debts for our belize sales for the year ended december  bwsl distributes our water primarily to residential properties  small hotels  and businesses which serve the tourist market 
demand for water in belize we believe that water sales in belize are cyclical  and on a similar cycle to sales in the cayman islands  since both operations cater to similar tourist markets 
we also believe that water sales will be higher in the future since sales were limited before march because the production capacity of the water plant was lower than demand 
our sales in belize were restricted in august  september and october because of several major component failures at our san pedro plant 
we believe that we could have sold more water during these months if our plant had been able to operate at full capacity 
we have taken action to ensure this does not occur again by increasing our inventory of critical spare parts 
the table below lists the total volume of water we supplied to bwsl on a quarterly basis for the three years ended december  in thousands of us gallons first quarter    second quarter    third quarter    fourth quarter    total    sales made pre acquisition by seatec belize ltd 
used only for comparison purposes 
our operations under contract in bahamas in  we entered into a water supply agreement with south bimini international ltd 
and began supplying water under this contract on july  under our agreement south bimini international ltd 
is committed to pay for a minimum of  us gallons of water per customer per month  us gallons per customer per year on a take or pay basis in relation to the bimini sands resort property in south bimini island  bahamas 
the price of water supplied is adjusted for inflation annually based on bahamas government indices  and adjusted monthly for changes in the cost of electricity 
demand for water in bahamas we have only been supplying water in bimini for approximately twenty one months  to a resort property  which is partially completed and a small room hotel 
currently the resort is comprised of condominiums  and a developing slip marina 
by the end of  we anticipate that we will be providing water to an additional condominiums 
the resort property is ultimately expected to include over condominium units  a large hotel casino  and a marina that can accommodate twice as many boats as the existing facility 
we believe that water sales in bimini will be cyclical 
we expect that our sales will be higher during the summer months when tourists and fisherman arrive from the united states by boat  and when several large angling tournaments are traditionally held in bimini 
we expect that our sales will be lower during winter months when the weather is not conducive to pleasure boat travel from the united states 
the table below lists the total volume of water we supplied to south bimini international ltd 
on a quarterly basis for the year ended december  and the six month period ended december  in thousands of us gallons first quarter second quarter  third quarter  fourth quarter  total   critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to trade accounts receivable  deferred expenditures  property  plant and equipment and intangible assets 
our company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require management s more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our company s consolidated financial statements 
trade accounts receivable we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
management continuously evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable and recorded allowances for doubtful accounts based on estimates of the level of actual write offs which might be experienced 
these estimates are based on  among other things  comparisons of the relative age of accounts and consideration of actual write off history 
deferred expenditures these costs were incurred in connection with the recent acquisitions and pending financing transactions 
costs relating to the acquisition will be included as part of the purchase price allocation and our company will seek to repay our existing debt with either new debt  equity or a hybrid financing 
if we do not proceed with new financing  we may be required to expense the amounts relating to the financing transaction 
property  plant and equipment management makes estimates for the useful life of assets and reviews its policies from time to time 
in  we carried out an extensive engineering analysis of our potable water production and distribution equipment in grand cayman 
as a result of the analysis  management reassessed the useful economic lives of certain assets 
the reassessment resulted in reduced depreciation of  or per share on a basic and fully diluted basis for the year ended december  intangible asset intangible assets recorded are amortized over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
management tests for impairment by evaluating the remaining useful life of an intangible asset that is being amortized each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization 
impairment is tested based on projected discounted future cash flows using a discount rate reflecting our average cost of funds 
if our estimated projections are greater than our actual results there may be an impairment that has not been reflected in the accounts 
total income our total income includes water sales and other income from all of our business segments 
water sales income is comprised of retail water sales  via pipeline  to our individual cayman islands customers  and bulk water sales to belize water services limited and south bimini international ltd 
other income consists of monthly meter rental charges  sales to companies that deliver water by truck  connection and re connection charges and interest income 
until february   other income also included settlement fee payments for the supply of water to the britannia development by the operators of the hyatt hotel  which had its own water production facility 
expenses expenses include the cost of water sales direct expenses and our indirect  or general and administrative expenses 
direct expenses include royalty payments to the cayman islands government  electricity and chemical expenses  payments to ocean conversion cayman limited relating to the operation of the governor s harbour plant  production equipment and facility depreciation costs  equipment maintenance and expenses and operational staff costs 
indirect  or general and administrative  expenses consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits for administrative personnel  stock compensation expenses  office lease payments  depreciation on fixed assets used for administrative purposes  legal and professional fees and financing costs 
there are no income taxes in the cayman islands and we are currently exempt from taxes in belize 
we may be liable for gross revenue tax in the bahamas as disclosed in part i  item  under our discussion of our bahamas operations 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  total income total income increased by from  to  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
total income is comprised of water sales and other income 
the cayman operations increased total income by  for the year ended december   which is an increase of over the prior year and represents of the increase in total income 
the belize operations increased total income by  for the year ended december   which is an increase of over the prior year and represents of the increase in total income 
the addition of the bahamas operations as of july  increased total income by  for the year ended december   which is an increase of over the prior year and represents of the increase in total income 
water sales total water sales increased by from  to  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
total water sales increased as a result of several factors detailed below 
our cayman operation added  to water sales for the year ended december   which is an increase of over the prior year and represents of the total increase in water sales 
the number of us gallons we sold during the year ended december  increased by over the prior year 
this is the result of supplying water to the hyatt hotel and the britannia golf course 
our water sales to customers other than the hyatt hotel and the britannia golf course were essentially flat when compared to the prior year  despite a reduction in tourist air arrivals to the cayman islands due to continued air travel concerns and the downturn of the us economy during the year ended december  our belize operation added  to water sales for the year ended december   which is an increase of over the prior year and represents of the total increase in water sales 
in june  the automatic inflation adjustment decreased our belize water rates by an average of 
this was more than offset by a increase in the number of us gallons sold for the year ended december  over the prior year 
this increase occurred because during the year ended december   we experienced equipment malfunctions which temporarily reduced the production capacity of our plant by 
the addition of the bahamas operations as of july  increased water sales by  for the year ended december   which is an increase of over the prior year and represents of the total increase in water sales 
this was the result of a increase in the number of us gallons sold for the year ended december  over the prior year 
other income other income decreased by from  to  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this decrease was a result of the february  termination of the dispute settlement agreement with cayman hotel and golf inc  the owner of the hyatt grand cayman resort and britannia golf course 
these decreases were partially offset by small increases in meter rental fees  reconnection fees and interest income from excess cash balances and on overdue receivables in our belize operations 
cost of water sales cost of water sales increased by from  to  for the years ended december  and  respectively  while water sales revenues increased by for the year ended december  our cayman operations increased cost of water sales by  for the year ended december   which is an increase of  compared to an increase of in water sales revenue  over the prior year and represents of the total increase in cost of water sales 
the cost of water sales increased as a result of direct costs incurred to operate the britannia plant  which was acquired on february  these costs included salaries and benefits for additional staff  equipment maintenance costs  electricity  chemicals and insurance  which will continue now that we operate the britannia plant 
higher insurance costs also increased cost of water sales due to higher premium rates from our insurance provider  and additional insured values following the purchase of the britannia plant and the insurance for the full replacement value of all our reverse osmosis desalination plants 
some of this increase was offset  after the britannia plant was purchased  by a decrease in water purchase costs resulting from lower volume purchases from ocean conversion cayman limited 
we were unable to take full advantage of the lower per gallon production costs of the britannia plant as it only operated at capacity in the eleven months that we owned the britannia plant due to contractual minimum purchase requirements from ocean conversion cayman limited 
our belize operation increased cost of water sales by  for the year ended december   which is an increase of  compared to a increase in water sales revenue over the prior year and represents of the total increase in cost of water sales 
during the year ended december   we completed rebuilding the second diesel engine  in accordance with the engine manufacturer s preventive maintenance recommendations  which increased our cost of water sales 
also increasing our cost of water sales in were additional repairs and maintenance on the existing reverse osmosis equipment 
during the year ended december   we also settled various claims for compensation made by our customer in belize in march these claims were the result of our equipment failures that occurred in august and september and a minor miscalculation in the annual inflation adjustment formula in our contract 
the miscalculation dated back to november  which was prior to our acquisition of belize water limited  and upon correction  reduced our unit rate for water to our customer by per  us gallons 
the addition of the bahamas operations as of july  increased cost of water sales by  for the year ended december   which is an increase of  compared to an increase of in water sales revenue  over the prior year and represents of the total increase in cost of water sales 
although this plant still only operated at of capacity in  the improved gross margin illustrates the economies of scale that have been and will continue to be achieved 
gross profit gross profit margins decreased from to for the years ended december  and  respectively 
gross profit margins for our cayman operations decreased from to for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the primary reasons for this decrease are i approximately two thirds of the water produced by our britannia plant was sold to the hyatt hotel and britannia golf course at a lower rate than our standard commercial water rate  ii due to flat water sales to other customers  we were only able to utilize approximately of the production capacity of the britannia plant and iii we were not able to acquire water from our lowest priced source as a result of the minimum water purchase obligation we have with ocean conversion cayman limited 
gross profit margins for our belize operations decreased from to for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the reason for the decrease in the gross profit margin is increased cost of water sales over prior year periods due to the settlement costs with belize water services ltd 
as discussed above and additional repairs and maintenance on the reverse osmosis equipment in belize 
gross profit margin for our bahamas operations increased from a negative to a negative for the year ended december  the negative gross profit margins were due to lower than expected water sales resulting from a reduction in tourism and a relatively higher proportion of fixed costs such as depreciation  which we expected in the early phases of the bimini sands resort development project 
both of these are temporary factors and are not expected to continue in the future 
our bahamas operation has generated positive cash flow since january indirect expenses indirect expenses increased by from  to  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
indirect expenses were at and of total income for the year ended december  and  respectively 
our cayman operations increased indirect expenses by  for the year ended december   which is an increase of over the prior year and represents of the total increase in indirect expenses 
we attribute this increase to our accounting for stock compensation costs  unanticipated professional fees relating to our december  audit and form k review together with increased insurance premiums on our commercial and directors and officers insurance 
stock compensation costs increased  for the year ended december  as a result of an increase in our shares price during the last fiscal quarter 
unanticipated professional fees relating to our december  audit and k review were  and our commercial and directors and officers insurance increased by  we also had additional reporting costs in due to increased demand for our annual report and proxy statements 
these increases were mostly offset by a reduction in bonus costs and subscription costs for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
our belize operations increased indirect expenses by  for the year ended december   which is an increase of over the prior year and represents of the total increase in indirect expenses 
during the year ended december   we had additional costs as a result of higher insurance premiums and increased costs to repatriate funds 
the addition of the bahamas operations as of july  increased indirect expenses by  for the year ended december  which is an increase of over the prior year and represents of the total increase in indirect expenses 
these costs relate to the administration of the bahamas operations for a full year 
net income net income decreased by from  to  for the years ended december  and  respectively  as a result of the factors indicated above 
dividends in december  we increased our per share dividend from to per quarter and have paid dividends in this amount during the year ended december  we have consistently paid dividends to owners of our ordinary and redeemable preferred shares since we began declaring dividends in our board of directors has established a policy  but not a binding obligation  that we will seek to maintain a dividend pay out ratio in the range of to of net income 
while this policy is subject to modification by our board of directors  we expect to continue increasing our dividends  if our earnings grow 
our payment of any future cash dividends  however  will depend upon our earnings  financial condition  capital demand and other factors  including the condition in our new loan agreement effective february   with scotiabank cayman islands ltd 
that dividends be paid only from current cash flows 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  total income total income increased by from  to  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
total income is comprised of water sales and other income 
our cayman operations increased total income by  for the year ended december   which is an increase of over the prior year and represents of the increase in total income 
the addition of the operations of belize water limited as of july  increased total income by  for the year ended december   which is an increase of over the prior year and represents of the increase in total income 
the addition of the bahamas operations as of july  increased total income by  for the year ended december   which represents of the increase in total income 
water sales total water sales increased by from  to  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
total water sales increased as a result of several factors detailed below 
our cayman operation added  to water sales for the year ended december   which is an increase of over the prior year and represents of the total increase in water sales 
of this increase  was due to a increase in the number of us gallons sold 
this increase was due to a larger customer base and increased usage by commercial  residential and government customers  primarily water authority cayman  which experienced temporary shortfalls in its production capacity 
the remaining of the increase was due to an increase in water rates of approximately in accordance with our license agreement 
our cayman island average water rate for the first nine months of was per thousand us gallons 
for the final three months of  our rates were reduced by using the cayman islands consumer price index automatic adjustment formula contained in our license 
our rates were automatically reduced by in january our belize operation added  to water sales for the year ended december   which is an increase of over the prior year and represents of the total increase in water sales 
virtually all of the increase was due to an additional six months of operations over the prior period 
the number of us gallons sold in was however higher than the annual figures of the prior year due to increased demand from an expansion of the plant completed in march the addition of the bahamas operations as of july  increased water sales by  for the year ended december   which represents of the total increase in water sales 
other income other income decreased by from  to  for the years ended december  and  respectively  as a result of a slight decrease in interest income on available cash balances 
cost of water sales cost of water sales increased by  compared to an increase of in water sales revenue  from  to  for the years ended december  and  respectively  while our water sales revenue increased by for the year ended december  our cayman operations increased cost of water sales by  for the year ended december   which is an increase of  compared to an increase of in water sales revenue  over the prior year and represents of the total increase in cost of water sales 
the addition of the operations of belize water limited as of july  increased the cost of water sales by  for the year ended december   which is an increase of  compared to an increase of in water sales revenue  over the prior year and represents of the total increase in cost of water sales 
this increase in cost of water sales was due to increased water production to meet increased sales and machinery repairs related to the august and september equipment malfunctions  all of which were remedied in the addition of the bahamas operations as of july  increased cost of water sales by  for the year ended december   which represents of the total increase in cost of water sales 
gross profit gross profit margins increased from to for the years ended december  and  respectively 
gross profit margins for our cayman operations increased from to for the years ended december  and  respectively  as a result of decreased depreciation expense of approximately  from our reassessment of the useful economic lives of certain assets and increased plant efficiencies 
these lower expenses were offset by additional labor costs associated with plant maintenance  increased insurance premiums and an additional six months of intangible amortization of the purchase price of the belize water supply contract 
gross profit margins for our belize operations decreased from to for the years ended december  and  respectively  as a result of diesel engine repair costs and higher electricity costs resulting from the temporary utilization of a less efficient electric motor during the repair period 
gross profit margin for our bahamas operations for the year ended december  was a negative 
this was due to low water sales and a relatively higher proportion of fixed costs such as depreciation  which we expected in the early phases of the bimini sands resort development project 
both of these are temporary factors and are not expected to continue in the future 
indirect expenses indirect expenses increased by from  to  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
indirect expenses were at and of total income for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our cayman operations increased indirect expenses by  for the year ended december   which is an increase of over the prior year and represents of the total increase in indirect expenses 
of this increase  is due to the creation of a new executive position  director of special projects 
our acquisition of belize water limited as of july  increased indirect expenses by  for the year ended december   which is an increase of over the prior year and represents of the total increase in indirect expenses 
this increase was primarily due to an additional six months of indirect expenses over the previous period and the reallocation of certain employee duties 
the addition of the bahamas operations as of july  increased indirect expenses by  for the year ended december   which represents of the total increase in indirect expenses 
these costs related to the administration of the bahamas operations 
net income net income increased by from  to  for the years ended december  and  respectively as a result of the movements indicated above 
dividends in december  we increased our per share dividend to ordinary shareholders from to per quarter and have paid dividends in the amount during the year ended december  reassessment of useful economic lives of property  plant and equipment during the year ended december   we carried out an extensive engineering analysis of our potable water production and distribution equipment in grand cayman 
as a result of the analysis  management reassessed the useful economic lives of certain assets 
the reassessment resulted in reduced depreciation of  or per share on a basic and fully diluted basis for the year ended december  the assets affected and the basis for management s decisions are described below seven mile beach distribution system during  we revised our master distribution plan that was originally set out in in doing so  we determined that a previously planned relocation of our governor s harbour reverse osmosis plant was no longer advantageous 
therefore  the removal and relaying of pipeline to the service area in conjunction with this relocation was no longer needed 
furthermore  we determined that certain planned pipeline replacements were not necessary 
finally  the government revised its plans for significant road improvements in the service area  therefore  alleviating anticipated major changes to our seven mile beach distribution system 
as a result of the above plan reassessments  we concluded that a pipeline with the characteristics of our seven mile beach distribution system would have a useful economic life of years 
we  therefore  extended the useful economic life of this system from to years 
fourteen years have elapsed to date 
governor s harbour vapor compression vc building as discussed above  we previously planned to relocate our governor s harbour plant  which would have resulted in the removal of the vc building in which it was housed 
when we determined that the plant should remain in its current location in  we reassessed the building s useful life 
giving consideration to our plans to use the building in the future  the high quality construction and foundation of the building  as well as the fact that it accommodates large high pressure pumps for the plant  we concluded that the building had a remaining useful economic life of years from two years have elapsed since this useful economic life was determined 
distribution system meters our policy is to replace customer water meters according to manufacturer recommendations  which suggest replacement based on service years or water volume 
the manufacturer of our water meters advised us that they were extending the guarantee for a certain model to cover higher volumes and a longer period of time 
based on the revised guarantee  we reassessed the useful economic lives of all such models in service  to years being the mid point of a guaranteed time frame of to years 
vermeer trencher we own a vermeer trencher to construct water distribution pipelines within our franchise area 
as discussed above  we originally planned to make major changes to our distribution system as a result of a proposed relocation of our governor s harbour plant and significant road improvements planned by the government 
these projects would have required heavy utilization of this asset 
given the changes in plans identified above and the minor projects for which the trencher will be required  we reassessed the useful economic life to be years 
four years have elapsed to date 
west bay reverse osmosis plant our west bay reverse osmosis plant was manufactured and installed in and expanded in with state of the art technology 
at the time  we had concerns about potential accelerated obsolescence of the equipment because of continuing research and development in the reverse osmosis field  and as such  the original useful economic life was determined to be years 
in  we concluded with management that there were no indicators that significant changes were pending in the industry 
given the like new condition of the plant  its three year history of meeting operational requirements and expected future use  management reassessed the remaining useful economic life of the west bay plant to be years 
two years have elapsed to date 
liquidity and capital resources overview prior to our completion of the recent acquisitions  we generated cash primarily from our operations in the cayman islands  the bahamas and belize and  to a lesser extent  from the sale of our shares and through loans and credit facilities obtained from two banks 
as a result of our recent acquisitions  we began to generate cash from our recently acquired operations in the cayman islands  the british virgin islands  the bahamas and barbados 
cash flow is affected by the timely receipt of customer payments  by operating expenses  the timeliness and adequacy of rate increases excluding automatic adjustments to our rates for inflation and electricity costs  and various factors affecting tourism in the cayman islands  belize  the british virgin islands  barbados and the bahamas  such as weather conditions and the economy 
we use cash to fund our operations in the cayman islands  belize  the british virgin islands  barbados and the bahamas  to fund capital projects  to expand our infrastructure  to pay dividends  to repay principal on our loans  to repurchase our shares when appropriate and to take advantage of new investment opportunities which expand our operations 
operating activities cash generated from operating activities for the years ended december  and was  and  respectively 
we generate cash through the utilization of our existing plants  equipment and resources in all segments of the business  minimization of water losses and operating efficiencies created by our management team 
through our recent acquisitions  we expect our water sales to approximately double 
in addition  we believe that our administrative staff will be able to manage all our combined operations so that our indirect costs will not increase in proportion to water sales

in order to complete our recent acquisitions and refinance our existing debt 
cash used in financing activities for the years ended december  and was  and  respectively 
during the year ended december   our primary financing activity was a draw down of our royal bank of canada credit facility for an additional  in order to finance the investment in the britannia reverse osmosis plant  plus an increase in our short term bank indebtedness 
we also had proceeds from an issuance of ordinary shares to certain directors and officers who exercised stock options 
these were offset by the payment of our quarterly dividends and principal payments on our term loans 
cash generated from financing activities for the year ended december  was  compared to cash used of  for the year ended december  during  the primary financing activity was the payment of four interim quarterly dividends totaling per share 
this was offset by proceeds from a draw down on our credit facility  in order to fund the bahamas development and the exercise of stock options 
during the same period in  we received  net of share issue costs  from a public issuance of ordinary shares  which was primarily used for the purchase of the belize subsidiary

during the year ended december   we repurchased  ordinary shares at per share from a shareholder whose assets were being liquidated 
all of the shares repurchased were cancelled in accordance with cayman islands law 
material commitments for capital expenditures and contingencies at december   we had committed approximately  for capital expenditures for the purchase  construction and site preparation of two water storage tanks at our governors harbour plant 
we intend to finance these projects using cash from operations 
on february   we entered into a loan agreement with scotiabank cayman islands ltd 
to finance the recent acquisitions and refinance our existing debt 
the facilities are comprised of the following million revolving line of credit bearing interest at the floating base rate as established by cayman island class a licensed banks from time to time

the present interest rate is 
million six month term loan bearing interest on the same basis as the seven year term loan 
the present interest rate is 
we have used the proceeds from these facilities to refinance our existing debt  for working capital and to finance our recent acquisitions

we will be obligated to make equal quarterly payments of principal under the seven year term loan and all amounts borrowed under the six month term loan must be repaid at the maturity date for this facility 
we have collateralized all borrowings under the three facilities by providing scotiabank with a first lien on all of our assets  including the capital stock we acquired in our recent acquisitions 
the loan agreement for the three facilities contains standard terms and conditions for similar bank loans made in the cayman islands  including acceleration of the repayment of all borrowings either upon the demand of scotiabank cayman islands ltd 
or in the event of default under the loan agreement 
as part of our acquisition of ocean conversion cayman limited  with the approval of scotiabank cayman islands ltd  we have guaranteed the performance of ocean conversion cayman limited to the cayman islands government  pursuant to the water supply contract with the water authority cayman dated april  as amended 
as part of the acquisition of our interests in ocean conversion cayman limited  we agreed to indemnify the seller in respect of a guarantee given by the seller to the bank of nt butterfield son ltd

as a result of our pending acquisition of a controlling interest in waterfields company limited  we will be required to provide a performance guarantee to the water and sewerage corporation of the bahamas in relation to the water supply contract between waterfields company limited and the water and sewerage corporation 
impact of inflation under the terms of our cayman islands license  belize  bahamas  british virgin islands and barbados water sales agreements  there is an automatic price adjustment for inflation on an annual basis  subject to temporary exceptions 
we  therefore  believe that the impact of inflation on our net income  measured in consistent dollars  will not be material

forward looking statements we discuss in this annual report matters which are not historical facts  but which are forward looking statements 
we intend these forward looking statements to qualify for safe harbor from liability established by the private securities litigation reform act of these forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  our future plans  objectives  expectations and events  assumptions and estimates about our company and our industry in general 
the forward looking statements in this annual report reflect what we currently anticipate will happen 
what actually happens could differ materially from what we currently anticipate will happen 
we are not promising to make any public announcement when we think forward looking statements in this annual report are no longer accurate whether as a result of new information  what actually happens in the future or for any other reason 
important matters that may affect what will actually happen include  but are not limited to tourism and weather conditions in the areas we service  our ability to manage  integrate and realize the benefits from our recent acquisitions  scheduled new construction within our operating areas  the economies of the us and the areas we service  regulatory matters  availability of capital to repay a substantial portion of our bank debt and for expansion of our operations  and other factors described in the risk factors section below as well as elsewhere in this annual report 
risk factors we have described for you below some risks which may materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our exclusive license for our service area in the cayman islands may not be renewed in the future and requires that we obtain prior approval for any rate increase for reasons other than inflation 
in the cayman islands  we presently operate as a public water utility under an exclusive license originally issued to us in december by the government of the cayman islands 
our existing license expires on july  if we are not in default of any terms of the license  we have a right of first refusal to renew the license on terms that are no less favorable than those which the government offers to a third party 
nevertheless  we cannot assure you that the government will renew our license or that we will be able to negotiate a new license on satisfactory terms 
we would retain ownership of our production infrastructure and substantially all of our distribution infrastructure if our license were not renewed 
under our existing license  we must obtain prior approval from the cayman islands government to increase our rates for any reason other than inflation 
our ability to raise our rates is limited by this requirement  including potential delays and costs involved in obtaining government approval for a rate increase 
failure to obtain adequate rate increases could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
we rely on water supply agreements with our customers in belize  the bahamas  the british virgin islands and barbados which  upon their expiration  may not be renewed or may be renegotiated on less favorable terms to us 
we presently operate as bulk water suppliers under water sales agreements in belize with our customer  the belize water services limited  in the bahamas with our customers  the water sewerage corporation and south bimini international ltd  in barbados with our customer sandy lane properties ltd 
and in the british virgin islands with our customer  the department of water sewerage of the ministry of communications works of the british virgin islands government 
upon expiration  these agreements may not be renewed or may be renewed on less favorable terms 
for example  while we own our production plant in belize  belize water services has certain options upon the expiration of our agreement to purchase the plant at a mutually agreed upon price  extend the agreement for a mutually agreed period of no less than two years  and upon expiration of such extension  belize water services may either purchase the production plant at a price to be negotiated with us or may again extend the agreement for another ten years in exchange for our transfer of of the ownership of the production plant to belize water services at the time of the extension  with the remaining to be transferred at the expiration of the ten year term  or extend the agreement for ten years in exchange for our transfer of of the ownership of the production plant to belize water services at the time of the extension with the remaining to be transferred at the expiration of the ten year term 
we own our production and distribution plant in bimini in the bahamas  which  in the absence of any new agreement  must be removed from the property of south bimini international ltd 
at the expiration of our water supply agreement 
waterfields owns its production and distribution plant in nassau in the bahamas which under the terms of the contract is located on property owned by the water sewerage corporation of the government of the bahamas 
at the conclusion of the initial term of the contract with the water sewerage corporation  which occurs on the later of december  or when the company has delivered  million imperial gallons of water to the water sewerage corporation  the water sewerage corporation has the following options the water sewerage corporation may extend the term of the contract for an additional five years at a price to be negotiated  the water sewerage corporation may purchase the plant at a price to be negotiated with us  or it may require our company to remove the plant from the site 
termination of our exclusive distributorship agreement with dweer technology ltd 
would eliminate any competitive advantage that we presently have over our competition in obtaining new plants in the caribbean basin 
our wholly owned subsidiary  desalco limited  is currently the exclusive distributor in the caribbean basin for the dweer tm system produced by dweer technology ltd 
for use in reverse osmosis seawater desalination plants 
as a result  none of our competitors is able to offer this technology when bidding for new reverse osmosis seawater desalination plants in the caribbean basin 
as the dweer tm system is one of the most energy efficient recovery systems of its kind  the distributorship agreement with dweer technology ltd 
gives us a unique competitive advantage when bidding for new reverse osmosis seawater desalination plants 
if the distributorship agreement were terminated or not renewed on equally favorable terms  however  we would lose this competitive advantage  and it could be more difficult for us to obtain new contracts for plants in the caribbean basin 
failure to obtain new contracts for reverse osmosis seawater desalination plants in the caribbean basin could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
as a result of our recent acquisitions  we are now subject to additional water supply licenses and or agreements which may not be renewed or may be renegotiated on less favorable terms to us 
as a result of our recent acquisition of ocean conversion cayman limited  it now operates as our subsidiary under three water supply licenses with the water authority cayman expiring in march  november and november while we intend to re negotiate these licenses prior to expiration  we cannot provide any assurances that the government will renew these licenses or that we will be able to negotiate new licenses on satisfactory terms 
failure to renegotiate the licenses on terms favorable to us could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
the british virgin islands water and sewerage department has taken the position that our water supply agreement is operating on a month to month basis 
the term of ocean conversion bvi ltd 
s existing water supply agreement in the british virgin islands is uncertain 
ocean conversion bvi ltd 
believes that the existing water supply agreement with the british virgin islands water and sewerage department was automatically extended to may when the british virgin islands government did not make a required buyout payment in may the british virgin islands government  however  has taken the position that the water supply agreement continues on a month to month basis 
thus  it is possible that the government could attempt to terminate the agreement at any time 
while ocean conversion bvi ltd 
is currently attempting to negotiate a further extension of this agreement  there is no guarantee that an extension will be granted  or that if granted  such extension would be on terms favorable to ocean conversion bvi ltd 
failure to negotiate this agreement on terms favorable to us could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
we may not be able to successfully integrate the new assets that we acquired in the recent acquisitions 
increasing the size of our company in a relatively short period of time has placed a significant strain on our management resources 
management may be required to spend additional time and money on integration that would otherwise be spent developing our business and services and may not be successful in integrating the acquired assets into our current operations 
for example  integrating our new assets requires us to expand our management information systems and control our operating expenses 
as a result  we cannot assure you that the acquisitions will provide us with the expected benefits 
in addition  we cannot assure you that the acquisitions will not have a negative impact on our business and results of operation 
the costs of integrating our new assets may affect our ability to pay dividends 
we have traditionally sought to pay cash dividends to our shareholders out of our net income on a quarterly basis if funds are available 
the costs associated with integrating the new assets into our company  however  may reduce our net income 
if our net income is reduced  we will have fewer funds available to pay dividends 
in addition  our bank loan agreement with scotiabank cayman islands ltd 
requires that we pay dividends from current cash flows 
our business is affected by tourism  weather conditions  the economies of the locations where we provide service and the us and european economies 
tourist arrivals and weather conditions within our operating areas affect the demand for our water to a greater extent in the cayman islands and in belize than in the bahamas  the british virgin islands and barbados 
in the cayman islands and belize  the highest demand is normally in the first two quarters of each calendar year 
the lowest demand for water occurs in the third quarter of each calendar year 
a significant percentage of tourists visiting the cayman islands and belize come from the us and europe 
in addition  development activity in our service areas in the cayman islands is significantly impacted by the us economy 
accordingly  a significant downturn in tourist arrivals to the cayman islands or in the us or european economies for any reason would be detrimental to our revenues and operating results 
after the events of september   tourism decreased in the cayman islands and is only gradually returning to historical levels 
we may have difficulty accomplishing our growth strategy within and outside of our current operating areas 
even though we have an exclusive license for our present operating area in the cayman islands and supply agreements in the cayman islands  the bahamas  the british virgin islands  barbados and belize  our ability to expand our operating areas is often subject to the approval of the respective governments in each location 
further  part of our long term growth strategy is to expand our water supply and distribution operations to other locations outside of the cayman islands  the bahamas  barbados  the british virgin islands and belize 
our expansion into new locations depends on our ability to obtain necessary permits  licenses and approvals to operate in new territories 
we may not obtain these necessary permits  licenses and approvals in a timely and cost efficient manner  or at all 
our expansion to territories outside of our current operating areas includes significant risks  including  but not limited to  the following regulatory risks  including government relations difficulties  local regulations and currency controls  risks related to operating in foreign countries  including political instability  reliance on local economies  environmental or geographical problems  shortages of materials  immigration restrictions and skilled labor  risks related to development of new operations  including assessing the demand for water  engineering difficulties and inability to begin operations as scheduled  and risks relating to greater competition in these new territories  including the ability of our competitors to gain or retain market share by reducing prices 
even if our expansion plans are successful  we may have difficulty managing our growth 
we cannot assure you that any new operations outside of our current operating areas will attain or maintain profitability or that the results from these new operations will not negatively affect our overall profitability 
we do not own a majority interest in ocean conversion bvi ltd 
we recently acquired of the issued and outstanding voting shares of ocean conversion bvi ltd 
through our wholly owned subsidiary  desalco limited 
under the articles of association of ocean conversion bvi ltd  we are able to appoint three of the six directors of that company 
sage water holdings bvi ltd  which owns the remaining of the issued and outstanding voting shares  is entitled to appoint the remaining three directors 
if there is a tied vote of the directors on any matter  the president of the caribbean water and wastewater association is entitled to appoint a junior director to break the tie 
as a result  we will have to share the management of ocean conversion bvi ltd 
with sage water holdings bvi 
although we will provide management and engineering services to ocean conversion bvi ltd 
through desalco limited  this arrangement may not permit us to fully control the operations of the company 
our operations in the caribbean could be harmed by hurricanes 
our operations are susceptible to damage from hurricanes 
a significant hurricane could cause major damage to our equipment and properties and the properties of our customers  including the large tourist properties in these areas 
this would result in decreased revenues and profits from water sales until our damaged equipment and properties are repaired and our customers and the tourism industry returned to the status quo before the hurricane 
we do not insure our underground water distribution system on the cayman islands  nor the governor s harbour reservoirs which are constructed from earthen berms 
contamination to our processed water may cause disruption in our services and adversely affect our revenues 
our processed water may become contaminated by naturally occurring or man made compounds and events 
in the event that a portion of our processed water is contaminated  we may have to interrupt the supply of that water until we are able to install treatment equipment or substitute the flow of water from an uncontaminated water production source 
in addition  we may incur significant costs in order to treat a contaminated source of plant feed water through expansion of our current treatment facilities  or development of new treatment methods 
our inability to substitute processed water from an uncontaminated water source  or to adequately treat the contaminated plant feed water in a cost effective manner may have an adverse effect on our revenues 
in addition  in the wake of the september  terrorist attacks in new york  washington  dc and pennsylvania  we have taken steps to heighten employee awareness of threats to our water supply 
while we are not aware of any specific threats to our facilities  operations or supplies  we have and will continue to take security precautions to protect our facilities  operations and supplies 
it is possible  however  that we would not be in a position to control the outcome or the costs of such events should they occur  which could have an adverse effect on the results of our operations 
we could be negatively affected by potential government actions and regulations 
any government that regulates our operations may issue legislation or adopt new regulations  including but not limited to restricting foreign ownership of our company  providing for the expropriation of our assets by the government  providing for nationalization of public utilities by the government  providing for different water quality standards  resulting in unilateral changes to or renegotiation of our exclusive licenses  or causing currency exchange fluctuations or devaluations or changes in tax laws 
service of process and enforcement of legal proceedings commenced against us in the united states may be difficult to obtain 
service of process on our company and our directors and officers  fourteen out of seventeen of whom reside outside the united states  may be difficult to obtain within the united states 
also  since substantially all of our assets are currently located outside the united states  any judgment obtained in the united states against us may not be collectible 
there is no reciprocal statutory enforcement of foreign judgments between the united states and the cayman islands  so foreign judgments originating from the united states are not directly enforceable in the cayman islands 
a prevailing party in a united states proceeding against us or our officers or directors would have to initiate a new proceeding in the cayman islands using the united states judgment as evidence of the party s claim 
a prevailing party could rely on the summary judgment procedures available in the cayman islands  subject to available defenses in the cayman islands courts  including  but not limited to  the lack of competent jurisdiction in the united states courts  lack of due service of process in the united states proceeding  and the possibility that enforcement or recognition of the united states judgment would be contrary to the public policy of the cayman islands 
depending on the nature of damages awarded  civil liabilities under the securities act of or the securities exchange act of for original actions instituted outside the cayman islands may or may not be enforceable 
for example  a united states judgment awarding remedies unobtainable in any legal action in the courts of the cayman islands for example  treble damages  which would probably be regarded as penalties  would not likely be enforceable under any circumstances 
we rely heavily on the efforts of several key employees 
our success depends upon the abilities of our executive officers 
in particular  the loss of the services of jeffrey parker  our chairman and chief executive officer  or fredrick mctaggart  our president  chief operating officer and chief financial officer  could be detrimental to our operations and our continued success 
although messrs 
parker and mctaggart have entered into three year employment agreements which automatically extend every year for an additional one year term  we cannot guarantee that mr 
parker or mr 
mctaggart will continue to work for us during the term of their agreements 
also  none of our employees have entered into non compete agreements with us 
provisions in our articles of association and an option deed adopted by our board of directors may discourage a change in control of our company and may make it more difficult for you to sell your ordinary shares 
our articles of association include provisions which may discourage or prevent a change in control of our company 
for instance  our board of directors consists of three groups 
each group serves a staggered term of three years before the directors in the group are up for re election 
also  our board of directors may refuse to register any transfer of shares on our books for any reason 
we have also adopted an option deed  which is similar to a poison pill 
the option deed will discourage a change in control of our company by causing substantial dilution to a person or group who attempts to acquire our company on terms not approved by the board of directors 
the option deed will expire on july  as a result of these provisions  which discourage or prevent an unfriendly or unapproved change in control of our company  you may not have an opportunity to sell your ordinary shares at a higher market price  which  at least temporarily  typically accompanies attempts to acquire control of a company through a tender offer  open market purchase or otherwise 
there may be a risk of variation in currency exchange rates 
although we report our results in united states dollars  the majority of our revenue is earned in cayman islands dollars and belizean dollars 
prior to our acquisition of control of waterfields company limited  our bahamas revenue was earned in united states dollars 
as a result of our acquisition of control of waterfields limited  we now earn revenue in bahamian dollars 
the cayman islands dollar is presently fixed at us ci 
the rate of exchange has been fixed since the belizean dollar has been fixed at us bze since and the bahamian dollar has been fixed at us bah since in addition  as a result of our recent acquisitions  we also earn revenue in the british virgin islands whose currency is in united states dollars and barbados whose currency is in barbadian dollars 
the barbadian dollar has been fixed at us bds since as a result  we do not intend to hedge against any exchange rate risk associated with our reporting in united states dollars 
if any of these fixed exchange rates becomes a floating exchange rate  however  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk credit risk we are not exposed to significant credit risk on retail customer accounts in the cayman islands  as our policy is to cease supply of water to customers whose accounts are more than days overdue 
our main exposure to credit risk is from our bulk water sales customers in belize  the bahamas  the british virgin islands  barbados and the cayman islands 
interest rate risk as of december   we had loans outstanding of  from the european investment bank at fixed interest rate of and  from the royal bank of canada  bearing interest at libor plus 
on february   we borrowed  from scotiabank cayman islands ltd  at an annually adjusted floating rate of libor plus to  depending on the ratio of our consolidated debt to our consolidated earnings before interest  taxes and depreciation  from which our debt to the royal bank of canada has been repaid 
we are subject to interest rate risk to the extent that libo or scotiabank cayman islands ltd 
s prime lending rate changes 
foreign exchange risk all of our foreign currencies have fixed exchanged rates to the us dollar 
if any of these fixed exchange rates become a floating exchange rate  however  our results of operation could be adversely affected
