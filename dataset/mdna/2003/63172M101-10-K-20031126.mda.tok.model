investors in our common stock are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements 
forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance 
forward looking statements are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties that could cause our future business  financial condition or results of operations to differ materially from our historical results or currently anticipated results 
investors should carefully review the information contained under the caption factors affecting future results beginning on page of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and elsewhere in or incorporated by reference into this report 
the following discussion and analysis also should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
all forward looking statements included in this document are based on information available to us on the date hereof  and we assume no obligation to update any such forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are made in reliance upon the safe harbor provision of the private securities litigation reform act of overview we are a leading provider of full chip circuit simulation and analysis software for the design and verification of complex semiconductors 
our customers use our software to reduce time to market and achieve first silicon success by simulating complex designs rapidly and accurately 
we released our first product  hsim  in july and began recognizing revenue from hsim in the three months ended september  in february  with the release of hsim  we also introduced two new options  circuitcheck and cadence analog artist integration  which are sold as separate options 
we released our second major product  lexsim  in may  and our third product  critic  in december in april  we released hsim with a new digital co simulation interface option  and in may  we released on a limited basis our fourth product  hanex 
sources of revenue we derive all of our revenue from software licensing and maintenance fees 
to date  we have derived substantially all of this revenue from the licensing and support of hsim 
we do not expect lexsim  critic and hanex to account for any meaningful percent of our total revenue until the second half of fiscal our software does not require customization and generally does not require on site implementation services 
as a result  we have not generated a significant amount of professional service or consulting revenue 
we do not consider backlog to be a meaningful measure of future revenue because our customers can generally cancel orders without penalty 
product revenue perpetual licenses historically  we have generated the majority of our total revenue from perpetual licenses 
as more customers have been purchasing time based licenses  product revenue as a percent of total revenue and in absolute dollars has decreased and accounted for only of our total revenue in fiscal as compared to of our total revenue in fiscal we expect that over time product revenue will continue to decrease as a percent of our total revenue 
perpetual license customers pay a one time license fee and are entitled to use the software as long as they desire 
to receive support  periodic updates and new enhancements from us  perpetual license customers must purchase maintenance contracts 
subscription revenue time based licenses our time based licenses give the customer the right to use our software for a fixed period of time  typically one to three years  and include maintenance 
time based licenses can be renewed for one or more years 
at times  customers may also acquire additional licenses for a shorter term  typically multiples of one month licenses  to be used when they reach certain stages of the design process in conjunction with their other time based or perpetual licenses 
these shorter term licenses are sold primarily to help customers with their peak usage demands 
to date  revenue from these shorter term licenses has not been significant 
an increasing absolute dollar amount and proportion of our total revenue is derived from time based licenses  as more of our large customers who initially subscribe to time based licenses renew those licenses or subscribe to additional time based licenses 
in today s challenging economic environment  some of the customers who had purchased perpetual licenses previously and new customers are also choosing to purchase time based licenses due to their flexible licensing and payment terms and we expect this trend to continue 
maintenance revenue our perpetual license customers typically purchase maintenance contracts and renew them annually 
customers who purchase maintenance receive support  updates and enhancements when we make them available to our general installed base 
we anticipate that as an increasing proportion of our future licenses come from time based licenses  maintenance revenue may decrease as a percent of total revenue 
maintenance revenue may also fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to the timing of annual renewals 
deferred revenue we include in deferred revenue time based licenses and maintenance that are invoiced in advance and are either paid or due 
we generally recognize deferred revenue from these sources ratably over the contract period on a straight line basis 
deferred revenue also consists of deferred perpetual license fees for which all of the revenue recognition criteria have not been met 
deferred revenue fluctuates depending on the timing of perpetual licenses meeting all the revenue recognition criteria  as well as the number  subscription period  payment terms and timing of renewals or new purchases of time based licenses and maintenance contracts 
we classify deferred revenue expected to be recognized beyond one year from the balance sheet date as long term deferred revenue 
foreign currency transactions our revenue is generally denominated in united states dollars  however  our operating expenses in international locations are denominated in local currencies 
historically  our exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations has been minimal  however  as our international sales and operations expand  we anticipate that our exposure to risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations will increase 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with the provisions of american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  software revenue recognition 
the application of sop requires judgment  including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements  and if so  whether vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for each of those elements 
when certain elements of an arrangement are delivered at different times  the ability to identify vsoe for those undelivered elements could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue 
we recognize and report revenue in three separate categories product revenue  subscription revenue and maintenance revenue 
product revenue is derived from perpetual license fees 
subscription revenue is derived from time based license fees and includes maintenance during the license period 
we recognize product revenue and subscription revenue when all of the following conditions are met a written purchase order  license agreement or other contract has been executed  the product and the production license key have been delivered  user acceptance periods  if any  have expired  the license fee is fixed and determinable  and collection of the fee is probable 
vsoe exists for maintenance on perpetual licenses based on renewal rates 
our customers generally purchase the first year of maintenance when they purchase a perpetual license  so we use the residual method to determine the allocation of revenue to the license portion of multiple element arrangements involving perpetual licenses 
because we bundle both the license and maintenance into our agreements for time based licenses for the entire term  vsoe does not exist for each element of the arrangement 
therefore  we recognize subscription revenue from time based licenses ratably over the period of the license 
maintenance revenue is derived from the annual maintenance contracts that are purchased by perpetual licensees 
we generally recognize revenue from maintenance ratably over the maintenance period  which is typically one year 
future changes in accounting pronouncements  including those affecting revenue recognition  could require us to change our methods of revenue recognition 
these changes could cause us to defer revenue from current periods to subsequent periods or accelerate recognition of deferred revenue to current periods 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on management s best estimate of probable losses inherent in the outstanding accounts receivable balance 
management determines the allowance based on known troubled accounts  historical experience and other currently available evidence 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
sales commission accrual and expenses sales commissions are earned and paid to our sales force for each order received  shipped and collected 
based on our policies  we pay a portion of the sales commissions based on both bookings and collections and the commission rate varies depending on each sales person s ability to attain his or her annual quota 
commission rates increase as the sales person achieves a certain percent of his or her annual quota 
we determine an estimated average annual commission rate during the first three fiscal quarters for purposes of accruing commissions 
we adjust the balance of the commission accrual and the actual commission expense at the end of each fiscal year based on each sales person s actual commission rates 
contingent liabilities we are subject to several legal proceedings and claims  the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty 
standard financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably evaluated  taking into account the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss  among other factors 
changes in these factors could materially impact our financial position or our results of operations 
we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be recorded 
to date  we have not accrued any loss contingencies 
recent accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no

 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas no 
amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years ending after december  we adopted the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
for the quarterly period beginning on january  we do not expect to change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation  therefore  the adoption of sfas no 
had no impact on our financial position  results of operation or cash flows 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin  consolidated financial statements  for certain entities that do not have sufficient equity at risk to finance their activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties or in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest variable interest entities 
variable interest entities within the scope of fin will be required to be consolidated by their primary beneficiary 
the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is determined to be the party that absorbs a majority of the entity s expected losses  receives a majority of its expected returns  or both 
fin applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
it applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after december  to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  we are in the process of determining what impact  if any  the adoption of the provisions of fin will have upon our financial condition or results of operations 
however  we do not expect that fin will have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations

results of operations the following table sets forth the results of our operations expressed as a percent of total revenue 
our historical operating results are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period 
years ended september  revenue product subscription maintenance total revenue cost of revenue product subscription maintenance gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative stock based compensation total operating expenses income from operations interest income other income expense  net income before taxes provision for taxes net income fiscal years ended september  and revenue total revenue 
total revenue consists of product  subscription and maintenance revenue 
total revenue increased by  or million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in our end user base resulting in substantial growth in subscription and maintenance revenue  partially offset by decreases in perpetual license sales 
revenue from sales outside of north america accounted for and of total revenue for fiscal and  respectively 
the percent of total revenue from outside of north america decreased due to domestic revenue growing at a faster rate than revenue from outside of north america 
revenue from japan was and of our total revenue in fiscal and  respectively 
no other country outside north america accounted for more than of our total revenue in either period 
we expect that revenue from sales outside of north america will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenue in the future 
marubeni solutions  our exclusive distributor for japan  accounted for approximately and of our total revenue for fiscal and  respectively 
broadcom corporation accounted for approximately of our total revenue for fiscal no other customer or distributor accounted for more than of our total revenue during either period 
deferred revenue includes perpetual license fees for which all of the revenue recognition criteria has not been met  time based license fees that have been invoiced and are due or collected for which we recognize revenue ratably over the term of the license period  and maintenance fees on perpetual licenses for which we also recognize revenue ratably over the term of the maintenance period 
our total deferred revenue increased from million as of september  to million as of september  the increase in deferred revenue was primarily due to increases in both deferred time based license revenue and deferred maintenance revenue from new purchases and renewals of time based licenses and maintenance for perpetual licenses 
we expect deferred revenue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending on the number of additional time based license purchases  the timing of renewals of time based licenses and maintenance and their respective payment terms 
additionally  deferred revenue may not increase if more customers prefer quarterly payments for time based licenses and maintenance 
product revenue 
product revenue decreased by  or million  from million for fiscal to million for fiscal the decrease was primarily due to more customers  particularly major accounts  purchasing time based licenses as compared to perpetual licenses and lower customer demand due to tighter budgets in a prolonged economic downturn 
as a percent of total revenue  product revenue decreased from for fiscal to for fiscal subscription revenue 
subscription revenue increased by  or million  from million for fiscal to million for fiscal the increase was primarily due to new customers purchasing time based licenses  as well as existing customers purchasing additional time based licenses and renewing their expired time based licenses 
as a percent of total revenue  subscription revenue rose from for fiscal to for fiscal we expect time based licenses to account for an increasing percent of total revenue in the future 
maintenance revenue 
maintenance revenue increased by  or million  from million for fiscal to million for fiscal the increase in maintenance revenue was due to the increase in the number of perpetual licenses in our installed base 
as a percent of total revenue  maintenance revenue increased from for fiscal to for fiscal we expect maintenance revenue to vary as a percent of total revenue based on the growth rate of product revenue relative to subscription revenue and the number of customers renewing annual maintenance 
if maintenance revenue increases as a percent of total revenue  our gross profit as a percent of total revenue  or gross margin  may decrease because of lower margins on maintenance revenue due to incremental maintenance support costs 
cost of revenue cost of product revenue 
cost of product revenue consists primarily of royalties due from us to third parties under original equipment manufacturer arrangements 
we incur only minimal costs to deliver our software as the product and documentation are primarily sent electronically 
our cost of product revenue decreased by  or  from  for fiscal to  for fiscal due to a decrease in the sublicensing of third party products 
as a percent of total revenue  the cost of product revenue decreased from for fiscal to for fiscal we expect the cost of product revenue as a percent of total revenue to vary in the future based on the level of sales of third party products 
cost of subscription revenue 
cost of subscription revenue consists primarily of personnel and allocated overhead expenses for support of time based licenses 
our cost of subscription revenue increased by  or  from  for fiscal to  for fiscal the increase in cost of subscription revenue was primarily due to the increase in personnel and other costs associated with the support of a larger number of time based licenses 
as a percent of total revenue  the cost of subscription revenue increased from in fiscal to for fiscal we expect the absolute dollar amount of the cost of subscription revenue to increase over the next months as we continue to increase our support organization to accommodate an increasing installed base of time based licenses 
cost of maintenance revenue 
cost of maintenance revenue consists primarily of personnel and other expenses related to providing maintenance support to our customers who purchase perpetual licenses 
our cost of maintenance revenue increased by  or  from  for fiscal to  for fiscal the increase in cost of maintenance revenue was primarily due to increased hiring of dedicated support personnel to provide support to a growing installed user base 
as a percent of total revenue  the cost of maintenance revenue increased from for fiscal to for fiscal we expect that the absolute dollar amount of cost of maintenance revenue will grow in the next months as we continue to increase support for our growing base of domestic and international customers 
operating expenses we anticipate that our operating expenses will continue to increase in the future as we fund more research and development projects  increase our sales and marketing operations both domestically and internationally  develop new sales channels  broaden our technical support and improve our operational and financial systems 
our increased operating expenses will result primarily from higher headcount in all areas  and we expect our headcount to double over the next to months 
in fiscal and fiscal  legal fees and other expenses related to our litigation with synopsys were million and million  respectively 
we also expect the cost of the synopsys litigation to increase as we continue to defend ourselves vigorously and the lawsuits move toward trial 
additionally  we also expect costs related to being a public company  such as directors and officers liabilities insurance  professional fees and various filing fees to increase our general and administrative expenses 
we believe that our operating expenses will continue to grow in absolute dollars in future periods although the rate of growth in expenses from period to period may vary 
we expect  however  that as a percent of revenue  operating expenses will not decline significantly  if at all 
we will need to generate significant revenue in the future to maintain profitability 
to increase market share in international locations and better serve our customers  we plan to further expand our international operations 
as a result of these investments in our international operations  we may experience an increase in cost of sales and other operating expenses disproportionate to revenue from those operations 
for example  during fiscal  we opened a support office in bangalore  india 
in fiscal  we accrued bonuses of an aggregate of  earned by our employees for their services in fiscal these bonuses will be paid in december in fiscal  we accrued bonuses of an aggregate of  earned by our employees for their services in fiscal to be paid on specified schedules 
in addition  our executive officers orally agreed that they would not receive their base salaries in fiscal and fiscal in october  our compensation committee of our board of directors reinstated the salaries of our executive officers and we expect to pay base salaries of approximately  to these officers in fiscal as a result of our significant bonus accruals and the foregone salaries in fiscal and fiscal  our compensation expense in fiscal may not be consistent with compensation expense in fiscal or fiscal or indicative of future periods 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist of engineering costs to develop new products  such as lexsim  critic and hanex  enhance existing products  such as the release of hsim in april  and perform quality assurance activities 
our research and development expenses increased by  or million  from million for fiscal to million for fiscal the increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to the hiring of additional research and development personnel and increases in bonuses 
research and development headcount increased from at september  to at september  and to at september  as a percent of total revenue  research and development expenses increased from in fiscal to in fiscal to maintain our competitive position and continue to deliver new technologies that solve our customers nanometer design challenges  we anticipate that research and development expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars as we invest in additional resources in existing and future products 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions  travel  promotional and advertising costs 
our sales and marketing expenses increased by  or million  from million for fiscal to million for fiscal the absolute dollar increases in sales and marketing expenses were primarily due to the hiring of additional sales  application engineering and marketing personnel  the total number of whom increased from at september  to at september  and to at september  as a percent of total revenue  sales and marketing expenses increased from in fiscal to in fiscal we expect that sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we further expand our global sales and support organization 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses represent corporate  finance  human resource  administrative  legal and consulting expenses 
our general and administrative expenses increased by  or million  from million for fiscal to million for fiscal as a percent of total revenue  general and administrative expenses increased from for fiscal to for fiscal the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to legal fees and costs related to being a public company 
as a percent of total revenue  legal fees increased from for fiscal to for fiscal primarily due to increased litigation related costs as we continued to defend ourselves vigorously against the lawsuits brought against us by synopsys 
general and administrative headcount increased from at september  to at september  we expect that general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars to support the growth of our future operations  as well as from increased legal fees  directors and officers liability insurance and the costs of public company compliance reporting 
stock based compensation 
we did not record any deferred stock based compensation in fiscal or fiscal we have been amortizing stock based compensation recorded previously over the vesting period of the related options  which is generally four years 
we amortized million and  of stock based compensation in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
we expect aggregate stock based compensation expense of approximately  during fiscal and approximately  during fiscal stock based compensation expense decreased by  or  from million for fiscal to  for fiscal as a percent of total revenue  stock based compensation expense decreased slightly from for fiscal to for fiscal interest income interest income increased by  or  from  for fiscal to  for fiscal due to profitability and positive cash flow  our cash and investment balances increased in fiscal  which resulted in increased interest income despite lower interest rates 
as a percent of total revenue  interest income stayed flat at of total revenue for fiscal and fiscal other income expense  net our other income expense  net remained relatively unchanged and was insignificant for fiscal and fiscal income taxes the provision for income taxes as a percent of income before taxes was and for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate from the prior year was primarily due to the reduction of state income taxes as a result of increases in tax credits 
fiscal years ended september  and revenue total revenue 
total revenue increased million  from million for fiscal to million for fiscal this increase was attributable to an increase in our end user base resulting in substantial growth in product  subscription and maintenance revenue  as well as additional sales to our existing end users 
revenue from sales outside of north america accounted for and of total revenue for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the percent of total revenue from outside of north america decreased due to domestic revenue growing at a faster rate than revenue from outside of north america primarily because of increased sales to more domestic major customers

marubeni solutions accounted for approximately and of our total revenue for fiscal and  respectively 
no other customer or distributor accounted for more than of our total revenue during either period 
deferred revenue increased from million as of september  to million as of september  this increase in deferred revenue was attributable to an increase in deferred time based license revenue and deferred maintenance revenue from new purchases and renewals of maintenance for perpetual licenses 
product revenue 
product revenue increased by million  from million for fiscal to million for fiscal as a percent of total revenue  product revenue decreased from for fiscal to for fiscal  as the growth rate in sales of perpetual licenses was outpaced by growth in time based licenses 
subscription revenue 
subscription revenue increased by million  from million for fiscal to million for fiscal this increase was primarily due to new customers purchasing time based licenses  as well as existing customers purchasing additional time based licenses 
as a percent of total revenue  subscription revenue rose from for fiscal to for fiscal maintenance revenue

general and administrative expenses increased by million  from million for fiscal to million for fiscal as a percent of total revenue  general and administrative expenses increased from for fiscal to for fiscal the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to legal fees  the hiring of additional finance and operations personnel and costs related to being a public company 
as a percent of total revenue  legal fees increased from during fiscal to during fiscal primarily due to increased litigation related costs 
stock based compensation 
we recorded deferred stock based compensation of million in connection with stock option grants in fiscal we amortized million and million of stock based compensation in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
as a percent of total revenue  stock based compensation expense decreased from for fiscal to for fiscal stock based compensation expense decreased due to the one time charge resulting from the acceleration of certain non qualified stock options in fiscal interest income interest income increased by  from  for fiscal to  for fiscal due to net proceeds from our initial public offering and increasing profitability and cash flow  cash and investment balances increased in fiscal  which resulted in increased interest income despite lower interest rates 
as a percent of total revenue  interest income increased from for fiscal to for fiscal other income expense  net our other income expense  net remained relatively unchanged and was immaterial for fiscal and fiscal income taxes the provision for income taxes as a percent of income before taxes was for fiscal and for fiscal the decrease in the effective tax rate from the prior year was primarily due to the reduction of amortization of stock based compensation as a percent of income before taxes 
liquidity and capital resources from inception through fiscal  we have financed our operations primarily through public offerings of our common stock  the sale of common stock to employees and cash from net income 
total net proceeds of our december initial public offering after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses  including the exercise of the over allotment option  were approximately million 
as of september   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million  an increase of million from million as of september   and working capital of million  an increase of million from million as of september  average days sales outstanding increased from days as of september  to days as of september  and decreased to days as of september  the increase in average days sales outstanding in fiscal was due to increased sales and revenue being invoiced more unevenly during the fourth quarter 
the decrease in days sales outstanding in fiscal was due to a majority of our total revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal being either derived from deferred revenue or backlog that was invoiced early in the quarter  which left little uncollected as of september  net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal resulted primarily from net income and increases in accrued liabilities and deferred revenue 
in addition  in fiscal  an increase in accounts receivable and a decrease in long term liabilities partially offset the increase in net cash provided by operating activities 
in fiscal  a decrease in accounts receivable also resulted in additional increase in net cash provided by operating activities 
net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
in these periods  the net cash used primarily related to the purchase of investment securities with maturities of days to one year and purchases of property and equipment 
capital expenditures were approximately   and  for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
our capital expenditures consisted of purchases of computer equipment  software and office furniture and fixtures 
net cash provided by financing activities was  million and million for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
for fiscal  net cash provided by financing activities was primarily from proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options 
for fiscal  net cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to the net proceeds from the sale of million shares of common stock in our initial public offering 
for fiscal  net cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to the net proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock plan purchases 
as of september   we had no borrowings  lines of credit  outstanding equipment leases or lease lines 
we intend to continue to invest heavily in the development of new products and enhancements to existing products 
we also intend to increase our sales and marketing operations 
our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the amount and timing of orders and their respective payment terms  the extent to which our existing and new products gain market acceptance  the extent to which customers continue to renew annual time based licenses and maintenance  the cost and timing of expansion of product research and development efforts  including such efforts outside north america  and the success of these development efforts  the cost and timing of expansion of sales and marketing activities  including such activities outside north america  the cost of litigation and damages when and if awarded  and available borrowings under future credit arrangements  if any 
we believe that our current cash and investment balances and any cash generated from operations  will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements for at least the next months 
however  it is possible that we may require additional financing within this period 
we have no current plans  and we are not currently negotiating to obtain additional financing 
the factors described above will affect our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds 
in addition  even if we raise sufficient funds to meet our anticipated cash needs during the next months  we may need to raise additional funds beyond this time 
we may be required to raise those funds through public or private financings  strategic relationships or other arrangements 
we cannot assure you that such funding  if needed  will be available on terms attractive to us  or at all 
furthermore  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
if we fail to raise capital as and when needed  our failure could have a negative impact on our ability to pursue our business strategy and maintain profitability 
stock repurchase program in october  our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to million of our common stock over a month period  which our board extended for another month period in october shares will be repurchased in the open market at times and prices we consider appropriate 
the timing of purchases and the exact number of shares to be purchased will depend on market conditions 
common shares reacquired are intended to be used for general corporate purposes 
as of the date we filed this annual report on form k with the sec  we had not repurchased any shares under this program 
contractual obligations we lease our facilities under various noncancelable operating leases 
in december  we entered into a three year operating lease for our headquarters located in santa clara  california  which began in february these noncancelable operating leases began expiring in october rent expense was  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal as of september   the aggregate future noncancelable minimum rentals or operating leases are as follows in thousands years ending september  total  factors affecting future results we have relied and expect to continue to rely on hsim for a substantial majority of our revenue  and a decline in sales of licenses for hsim could cause our revenue to decline 
historically  we have derived substantially all of our revenue from hsim 
we believe hsim is the first hierarchical simulator that meets the circuit verification challenges of complex nanometer semiconductors 
we expect that the revenue from this product will continue to account for substantially all of our revenue for at least the next six months 
the electronic design automation software market  including the market for hierarchical simulator software  is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions  uncertain product life cycles and evolving industry standards 
if our competitors introduce new products and or offer aggressive pricing that compete with hsim  our revenue could decline materially and our results of operations could be harmed 
for instance  in fiscal  certain competitors were offering extremely competitive prices either by substantial discounting or bundling their products which resulted in a longer sales cycle for hsim or delays by prospective customers in making their purchasing decisions 
since we expect hsim to continue to account for substantially all of our revenue until at least the second half of fiscal  any factors adversely affecting the pricing of our licenses of or demand for hsim  including competition or technological change  could cause our revenue to decline materially and our business to suffer 
our revenue would decline substantially if our existing customers do not purchase additional licenses or renew existing time based licenses and maintenance from us 
we rely on additional perpetual and time based license revenue from our existing customers  as well as annual maintenance renewals for our perpetual licenses and renewals of our time based licenses when they expire 
even if we are successful in generating revenue from our software to new customers  if our existing customers do not purchase additional licenses of our software or renew their expired time based licenses or annual maintenance for perpetual licenses  we would experience a decline in revenue 
in fiscal  our revenue from perpetual licenses decreased as a result of more customers preference to purchase time based licenses and lower demand due to much tighter budgets 
revenue from time based licenses and maintenance has increased steadily over the last months and we expect it to continue to increase 
for instance  in fiscal  of our total revenue was derived from time based licenses and maintenance as compared to for fiscal as more of our revenue is attributable to time based licenses  our revenue could decline materially if our customers do not renew their existing time based licenses or purchase additional time based licenses 
if semiconductor design and manufacturing companies continue to experience recession or other conditions which impact their operating budgets  they may delay or cancel purchases of our software  which would reduce our revenues and cause our business to suffer 
the primary customers for our software are semiconductor design and manufacturing companies 
any significant downturn in our customers markets  or domestic and global conditions  which result in the reduction of research and development budgets or the delay of software purchases  would likely result in a decline in demand for our software and services and could harm our business 
since early  the semiconductor industry has experienced a substantial decline in order volume and revenue and that downturn has continued 
this could result in our customers delaying or canceling the purchase of our software 
any of these occurrences could have a significant impact on our operating results  revenues and costs and may cause the market price of our common stock to decline or become more volatile 
for example  we experienced a substantial change in customers purchasing behavior during the three months ended march  due to the prolonged economic downturn and concerns for their own financial stability 
consequently  as a cost cutting measure  customers either suspended or reduced their capital budgets dramatically  which adversely affected our revenue 
in addition  we were unable to meet revenue and earnings expectations for the quarter ended march  and had to lower our revenue and earnings guidance for the quarter ended june  and fiscal as a result  the market price of our common stock was negatively impacted 
in addition  the markets for semiconductor products are cyclical 
for example  in recent years certain asian countries have experienced significant economic difficulties  including currency devaluation and instability  business failures and a depressed business environment 
more recently  certain asian countries have also experience difficulties from concerns about and the impact of closures due to sars 
these difficulties have triggered a significant downturn in the semiconductor market  resulting in reduced budgets for semiconductor design tools which  in turn  has negatively impacted us 
we cannot predict what impact the recent prolonged economic slowdown and in particular  the semiconductor industry  will have on our business  but it may result in fewer purchases of licenses of our software  substitution to our lower priced configurations by customers who previously licensed our higher priced configurations or nonrenewal of time based licenses or maintenance 
if the current economic slowdown continues  we may not meet our revenue expectations for upcoming quarters and fiscal we are currently a defendant in three lawsuits brought by synopsys 
the prosecution of these lawsuits could have a substantial negative impact on our business 
should synopsys prevail  we may be required to pay substantial monetary damages or be prevented from selling our software 
synopsys has filed claims against us in state and federal court 
these claims are based on the alleged facts and circumstances relating to the departure of our five founders from their employment at synopsys  the founding of our company and the development and sale of hsim and our other products 
each of our founders and dr 
sang s 
wang  our chief executive officer  became an employee of synopsys when synopsys acquired epic design technology in february dr 
wang resigned from synopsys in march and served as a consultant to synopsys until june dr 
an chang deng  our president  and our four other founders resigned from synopsys at approximately the same time in august and became employees of our company immediately thereafter 
dr 
wang became an employee of our company in april none of drs 
wang or deng or our four other founders was subject to a noncompetition agreement with synopsys at any time 
in february  synopsys filed a complaint in the superior court of the state of california in the county of santa clara case no 
cv against us and dr 
deng  our president 
the complaint alleged breach of contract  breach of fiduciary trust  diversion of corporate opportunity and constructive trust 
in september  synopsys filed its second amended complaint  which added claims of inducing aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty  including aiding and abetting diversion of corporate opportunity  misappropriation of trade secrets  civil conspiracy  breach of confidence and unfair competition  and added as individual defendants dr 
wang and our four other founders 
in september  synopsys filed a supplemental second amended complaint that contained supplemental allegations but added no new claims or parties 
in january  the discovery referee issued orders creating rebuttable presumptions in favor of synopsys on certain evidentiary issues to sanction us for erasure of certain computer files requested in discovery by synopsys 
these rulings mean that we must prove at trial that we did not take or use synopsys source code or other confidential information  rather than the usual requirement that synopsys provide such proof in the first instance 
however  none of these rulings resolves any of the claims made by synopsys in the case and the trial judge or jury can reach their own conclusions based upon the evidence presented at trial 
we filed a motion for reconsideration of this order and in march  the court denied our motion  concluding that it was barred on procedural grounds 
in january  synopsys filed a third amended complaint  which contained supplemental allegations but added no new claims or parties 
we have filed an answer denying synopsys allegations 
in august  synopsys filed several motions for terminating sanctions against us which are scheduled for hearing in january we oppose each of these motions and intend to file oppositions within the time permitted by law 
synopsys has requested unspecified damages of at least million  an injunction  a constructive trust on unspecified intellectual property belonging to us and other relief 
further  in september  synopsys notified us that it reserves the right to seek up to million in punitive damages with respect to claims for which punitive damages are allowed under california civil code section  and up to million in punitive damages with respect to the trade secret claims under california civil code section c 
this action is currently in discovery 
a trial date has not yet been set 
we believe that we have meritorious defenses to synopsys allegations and claims and we intend to continue to defend ourselves vigorously 
however  because of the inherent uncertainty of litigation in general  and the fact that the discovery related to this litigation is ongoing  we cannot assure you that we will ultimately prevail 
should synopsys ultimately succeed in the prosecution of its claims  we could be permanently enjoined from selling our software and deriving related maintenance revenue 
in addition  we could be required to pay substantial monetary damages to synopsys 
further  we could be enjoined preliminarily from selling our software during the course of the litigation 
litigation such as the suit synopsys has brought against us can take years to resolve and can be expensive to defend 
although the final outcome of the litigation may not occur for some time  the parties periodically conduct evidence gathering  meet to discuss the status of the litigation and file motions and other requests for the court to act 
the results of these periodic activities  particularly the court s decisions on current pending and future motions  could have the effect of determining the ultimate outcome of the litigation  either for or against us  prior to a trial on the merits  or strengthen or weaken our ability to assert claims and defenses 
for example  in november  the court denied a motion brought by synopsys for injunctive relief that  if granted  could have prevented us from selling our products 
if any of synopsys motions ultimately prevail  our ability to defend ourselves against the claims brought against us in this litigation could be severely limited 
it is possible that our relationships with our customers will be seriously harmed in the future as a result of the synopsys litigation 
accordingly  an adverse judgment  if entered in favor of any synopsys claim  could seriously harm our business  financial position and results of operations and cause our stock price to decline substantially 
in addition  the synopsys allegations and claims  even if ultimately determined to be without merit  could be time consuming to defend  result in costly litigation  divert our management s attention and resources  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or license agreements 
these royalty or license agreements may not be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all  and the prosecution of the synopsys allegations and claims could significantly harm our business  financial position and results of operations and cause our stock price to decline substantially 
in may  synopsys filed a complaint in the united states district court  northern district of california  san jose division case no 
co pvt against us  alleging that our hsim software infringes us patent no 
 entitled hierarchical power network simulation and analysis tool for reliability testing of deep submicron ic designs the patent  which is purportedly assigned to synopsys 
since the case began  synopsys has also alleged that our subsequently released hsim and lexsim products  infringe the patent 
synopsys has requested relief including damages from million to million and an injunction 
synopsys has also requested that any damage award be trebled for alleged willful infringement 
in june  we filed an answer to the complaint denying infringement of a valid  enforceable patent and asserting counterclaims 
we have since amended our counterclaims 
our current counterclaims allege that  among other things  the patent is invalid  unenforceable and not infringed and that synopsys has violated federal antitrust and state unfair competition laws 
from time to time  the court has ruled on summary judgment motions in the case 
in may  the court granted summary judgment in favor of synopsys on our invalidity defenses and counterclaims  concluding that they were barred by the doctrine of assignor estoppel 
the court denied synopsys motion with respect to our unenforceability defense and counterclaim 
in november  the court issued an order granting summary judgment in favor of synopsys on certain antitrust counterclaims based on the doctrine of assignor estoppel 
however  the court declined to rule on synopsys motion with respect to our other antitrust and unfair competition counterclaims 
in addition  the court issued a ruling construing the claims of the patent in august in september  the us patent and trademark office granted our request for ex parte reexamination of the patent based on prior art not previously considered by the patent office 
we have moved to stay the federal litigation pending the outcome of the reexamination and the court granted our motion in december during the reexamination of the patent  the patent office may determine that the subject matter in the patent is patentable as originally claimed  that the subject matter is patentable if the claims are modified or that the subject matter is not patentable 
we cannot predict what the result of the reexamination procedure will be or how long it will take to complete 
activity on several other summary judgment motions has been suspended because the court stayed the federal litigation 
in november  synopsys filed three motions for summary judgment 
the first motion asked the court to enter judgment before trial that nassda s products infringe the patent 
the second motion asked the court to rule before trial against us on our defense that the patent is unenforceable because synopsys committed inequitable conduct in obtaining the patent 
we submitted oppositions to both of these motions 
synopsys third motion asked the court to rule before trial against us on our remaining antitrust counterclaims 
because of the court s prior rulings against us on our other antitrust counterclaims  we did not oppose this motion 
in november  we also filed a summary judgment motion  which asked the court to enter judgment before trial that our products do not infringe the patent 
synopsys opposed this motion 
the court issued its order staying the federal litigation before the parties reply briefs were due 
in june  synopsys filed a second complaint in the united states district court  northern district of california  san francisco division case no 
c rs against us  alleging that the our products  including but not limited to hsim and hanex software products  infringe synopsys us patent no 
 entitled methods and systems for reliability analysis of cmos vlsi circuits based on stage partitioning and node activities the patent 
in july  we filed an answer denying that we infringe the patent and asserting as defenses that the patent is invalid and unenforceable 
we also brought a declaratory judgment counterclaim seeking judgment that the patent is not infringed by us and that the patent is invalid and unenforceable 
in august  synopsys filed a motion to dismiss these defenses and counterclaims on the ground that we are barred from contesting the validity and enforceability of the patent based on the doctrine of assignor estoppel 
synopsys motion also sought to strike our defenses of laches  patent misuse and unclean hands on the ground that we had not pleaded them with sufficient particularity 
we opposed synopsys motions 
in october  the court denied synopsys motion to dismiss and strike the invalidity and unenforceability defenses and counterclaims and granted synopsys motion to strike the laches  patent misuse and unclean hands defenses with leave to amend the pleadings 
the court has scheduled a case management conference for december we believe we have meritorious defenses to synopsys claims and intend to defend ourselves vigorously 
however  because of the high degree of complexity of the intellectual property at issue  the inherent uncertainties of litigation in general and the preliminary nature of this litigation  we cannot assure you that we will ultimately prevail 
should synopsys ultimately succeed in the prosecution of its claims  we could be permanently enjoined from selling our software and deriving related maintenance revenue 
in addition  we may be required to pay substantial monetary damages to synopsys 
further  we could be enjoined preliminarily from selling our software during the course of the litigation 
litigation such as the suit synopsys has brought against us can take years to resolve and can be expensive to defend 
the court s decisions on current pending and future motions could have the effect of determining the ultimate outcome of the litigation prior to a trial on the merits  or strengthen or weaken our ability to assert claims and defenses 
it is possible that our relationships with our customers will be seriously harmed in the future as a result of the synopsys litigation 
accordingly  an adverse judgment  if entered on any synopsys claim  could seriously harm our business  financial position and results of operations and cause our stock price to decline substantially 
in addition  the synopsys allegations and claims  even if ultimately determined to be without merit  could be time consuming to defend  result in costly litigation  divert our management s attention and resources  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or license agreements 
these royalty or license agreements may not be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all  and the prosecution of the synopsys allegations and claims could significantly harm our business  financial position and results of operations and cause our stock price to decline substantially 
on july   a purported derivative complaint was filed against us and our directors in the united states district court for the northern district of california 
this complaint alleged violations of california corporations code section  breach of fiduciary duty  waste of corporate assets and unjust enrichment based generally on the facts and circumstances alleged in the synopsys litigations 
the complaint seeks equitable relief and an unspecified amount of damages on behalf of nassda 
the case is still in the preliminary stages  and it is not possible for us to quantify the impact  if any  on nassda 
an unfavorable outcome in this case could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
in addition  the expense of defending any litigation may be costly and divert management s attention from the day to day operations of our business 
because many of our current competitors have greater resources than we do and pre existing relationships with our potential customers  we might not be able to achieve sufficient market penetration to sustain profitability or gain additional market share 
we face significant competition from larger companies that market suites of electronic design automation products that address all or almost all steps in the semiconductor design process 
many of these competitors have substantially greater financial  customer support  technical and marketing resources  larger customer bases  longer operating histories  greater name recognition and more established relationships in the industry than we do 
we cannot be sure that we will have the resources or expertise to compete successfully in the future 
if we are unable to gain additional market share due to their pre existing relationships with our potential customers  our operating results could be harmed 
our software is used to simulate and analyze complex nanometer scale semiconductor designs 
our competitors in the electronics design automation industry who offer products that are used for other segments of the semiconductor design process often bundle their products together to offer discounts on products competitive with those we offer  making those products extremely attractive for our customers or potential customers to use 
in addition  these competitors may not support our effort to integrate our software into their existing software 
these competitors include such companies as cadence  synopsys and mentor graphics 
since these competitors offer a more comprehensive range of products than we do  they are often able to respond more quickly or price more effectively to take advantage of new or changing opportunities and respond to new technologies and customer requirements 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully in such environments 
if we lose such opportunities to our competitors  our results of operations could be harmed significantly 
our business depends on continued demand for complex nanometer scale semiconductors and the electronic equipment that incorporate them 
our software is used to design complex nanometer scale semiconductors that are an integral part of portable consumer electronics  networking equipment  wireless communications equipment  multimedia devices and personal computers 
as a result  if the demand for these devices and businesses of the manufacturers of these products do not continue to grow  our revenue and business will suffer 
demand for portable consumer electronics may decrease if mobile phone  electronic mail or internet use declines  the cost of those services increases or consumers fail to adopt latest generation portable electronics 
potential consumers of portable consumer electronics may use or modify existing equipment and never adopt next generation portable consumer electronics 
demand for other complex electronic equipment  such as networking equipment  may decrease if service providers do not experience subscriber growth or defer network build outs or other capital spending 
purchases of licenses of our software are largely dependent upon the commencement of new design projects by semiconductor manufacturers and their customers  the number of design engineers and the increasing complexity of designs 
since late  the semiconductor industry has experienced a sharp decline in orders and revenue and many companies have reduced the number of design engineers and or design projects 
the outlook for the electronics industry is uncertain and we cannot predict how long the current downturn will last 
many semiconductor manufacturers and vendors of products incorporating semiconductors have announced earnings shortfalls and employee layoffs 
budget cuts have impacted the number of orders we receive from our customers and our customers in general have been seeking larger discounts and extended payment terms or purchasing time based licenses in lieu of more costly perpetual licenses 
we believe our customers and potential customers internal budgets have been and will continue to be subject to heightened scrutiny and the time required to receive budgetary approvals has lengthened 
we cannot predict whether purchases of licenses of our software will be further deferred due to budget constraints or whether the number of complex nanometer scale semiconductor design starts by our customers will be slower or decline even further 
if we lose any of our key personnel  our ability to manage our business and continue our growth would be negatively impacted 
our future success depends in part on our ability to enhance our existing products and achieve market acceptance of new  innovative products and technologies 
our software and technologies are complex and to successfully implement our business strategy and manage our business  an in depth understanding of circuit design and the physical behavior of complex nanometer scale semiconductors is required 
we depend substantially on the expertise of sang s 
wang  our chairman and chief executive officer  and our existing engineering personnel  especially an chang deng  our president  and our other founders 
we do not have long term employment agreements with our founders and the loss of the services of any of our key employees could adversely affect our business and slow our product development process 
we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our employees 
if we do not continue to expand our sales force and customer service and support organization  our revenue may not grow 
approximately  and of our total revenue for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively  were from our direct sales efforts 
our software requires sophisticated sales efforts by experienced and knowledgeable personnel 
competition for these individuals is intense due to the limited number of people available with the necessary sales experience and technical understanding of electronic design automation products 
hiring customer service and support personnel is also very competitive in our industry due to the limited number of people available with the necessary technical skills 
our sales and support staff consisted of persons as of september  if we are unable to successfully train and integrate sales and support personnel and continue to identify  hire  train and retain new qualified individuals  our revenue may not grow 
if we are unable to attract and retain qualified research and development personnel  our business will suffer 
there are a limited number of qualified software engineer and research and development personnel with the necessary experience and understanding of complex nanometer scale semiconductor design products in the san francisco bay area  where our primary facility is located 
the scarcity of qualified persons may cause us to incur higher salary costs or require us to provide larger stock option grants 
we have a small research and development facility in taiwan  out of which four of our engineers currently operate  to broaden the pool of software engineers from which we can recruit 
we cannot assure you that this strategy will help us satisfy our need for qualified personnel 
further  we may encounter other difficulties with managing geographically separate research and development activities 
if we fail to attract  motivate and retain engineers and research and development personnel  we may be unable to develop or enhance our software  meet the demands of our customers in a timely manner or remain competitive and our business would suffer 
because we rely on distributors for a large portion of our revenue  our revenue could decline if our existing distributors do not continue to purchase software licenses from us or represent us in those markets 
a majority of our sales outside north america and europe are conducted through distributors 
sales by our distributors accounted for approximately  and of our total revenue in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
we rely on marubeni solutions as the exclusive distributor of our software in japan 
sales to marubeni solutions accounted for  and of our total revenue in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to attract distributors that market our software effectively or provide timely and cost effective user support and service 
further  our agreements with our distributors provide exclusive distribution rights  but do not obligate the distributor to purchase any amount of licenses of our software or sell licenses of our software 
consequently  one or more of our distributors may not continue to represent our software or devote a sufficient amount of effort and resources to selling our licenses of software in their territories 
we may from time to time be forced to terminate relationships with distributors who do not maintain an appropriate level of sales 
we may also decide to sell our software in a particular territory directly and terminate relationships with a particular distributor 
as a result  our sales in a given territory may decrease substantially or cease until a suitable replacement distributor can be found or we are able to establish or provide adequate sales and support efforts for that territory 
even if we are successful in selling licenses of our software through new distributors  the rate of growth of our total revenue could be harmed if our existing distributors do not continue to sell licenses of our software 
if we fail to adequately match our expenses to anticipated revenue in any given quarter  our operating results could fall below market expectations and cause the price of our stock to decline 
because of the prolonged economic downturn  extended sales cycle  seasonal fluctuations in our business  cyclicality of the semiconductor industry and the rapidly evolving market for complex nanometer scale semiconductors  our ability to accurately forecast our quarterly revenue is limited 
as a result  it is difficult to predict the revenue we will recognize in any given quarter 
we expect to experience seasonal fluctuations in our revenue due to financial stability and outlook of our customers  capital budgeting and purchasing cycles of our customers  economic incentives for our sales force  lengthening of the sales cycle due to limited resources as a result of layoffs by our customers  longer approval process  summer holidays  particularly in europe and japan  and the number of orders received for perpetual licenses versus time based licenses 
commissions represent a significant portion of our sales force compensation  which is structured to encourage sales closures prior to fiscal year end 
as a result  we expect that sales efforts will intensify in the fourth fiscal quarter which could result in our revenue being flat or slightly lower in the first and second quarters of the subsequent fiscal year 
it is difficult for us to evaluate the degree to which these factors may reduce our sales because our revenue growth historically had masked the impact of these factors 
in addition  most of our costs are relatively fixed in the short term and our business may not grow rapidly enough to absorb the costs of our personnel and facilities 
as a result  we may be unable to reduce our expenses to avoid or minimize the negative impact on our quarterly operating results if anticipated revenue is not realized 
for example  for the three months ended march   our revenue and earnings fell short of our previous guidance and market expectation and we revised our guidance for the quarter ended june  and fiscal to project much lower revenue and earnings than previously given  which negatively impacted the trading price of our common stock 
although we were able to achieve revenue and earnings results that met the revised guidance for the three months ended june  and september   we did not see any meaningful improvements in our customers spending pattern and our outlook continues to be cautious 
these trends could materially affect our quarter to quarter operating results  which could negatively impact our stock price 
we may not succeed in creating market acceptance for lexsim  critic and hanex  and our operating results may decline as a result 
we released our second major product  lexsim  in may  our third product  critic  in december and our fourth product  hanex  in may to date  lexsim  critic and hanex have accounted for only an immaterial portion of our revenues 
even though we do not expect lexsim  critic or hanex to account for a meaningful percentage of our total revenue until the second half of fiscal  our future growth and profitability could be affected by our ability to increase sales of these new products 
furthermore  marketing new products requires significant additional expenses and resources 
if we fail to market them successfully  our profitability may decline 
if we fail to enhance our circuit simulation and analysis software and develop and introduce new circuit simulation and analysis software on a timely basis  we may not be able to address the needs of our customers  our technology may become obsolete and our results of operations may be harmed 
the electronic design automation software market is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions and enhancements  uncertain product life cycles  changes in user demands and evolving industry standards 
the introduction of software embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards can render existing software in the semiconductor design industry obsolete and unmarketable 
for instance  if customers widely adopt new engineering languages to describe their semiconductor designs and our software fails to support those languages adequately  demand for our software will suffer 
to be successful  we must devote a substantial amount of our resources to enhance our software  keep pace with changes within our industry and develop and market new technologies 
if our enhanced products or our future products and technologies do not achieve market acceptance  we may not be able to maintain our market share or recoup our development costs 
as a result  our operating results would be harmed 
our sales cycle is unpredictable and may be more than six months  so we may fail to adequately match our expenses to anticipated revenue in any given period or meet market expectations 
our sales cycle  or the period between our initial contact with a potential customer and the customer s purchase of a license of our software  generally ranges from three to six months but may be longer  particularly in the current economic downturn 
we cannot predict the exact length of our sales cycle  which at times has exceeded six months 
the unpredictability of our sales cycle makes it difficult to plan our expenses and forecast our results of operations for any given period 
if we do not correctly predict the timing of our customers purchases  the amount of revenue we recognize in a given quarter could be negatively impacted  which could harm our operating results 
our sales cycle may lengthen because of several factors  including long technical evaluation periods and validation periods for the integration of our software with our potential customers existing semiconductor design flow  the significant investment of resources required by customers to purchase and integrate our software into their design flow  particularly customers with large semiconductor design organizations  competition from other electronic design automation software vendors  limited and decreased capital spending due to weakness in the semiconductor industry and customers uncertainty about economic recovery  limited access to key decision makers of potential customers to authorize the adoption of our software  budget cycles of our customers which affect the timing of purchases  and delay of purchases due to product combination announcements or planned introductions of new products by our competitors or us 
if we were to experience a delay in our orders  it could harm our ability to meet our forecasts or investors expectations for a given quarter and ultimately result in the decrease of our stock price 
further  if our sales cycle unexpectedly lengthens in general  it would adversely affect the timing of our revenue recognition  which could cause us not to meet market expectations and cause our stock price to suffer 
for instance  for the three months ended june  and march   our revenue decreased as compared to the previous quarters because we experienced longer sales cycles  which negatively impacted our ability to receive orders and recognize revenue 
our expansion into international markets will result in higher personnel costs or distributor commissions and could reduce our operating margins 
in order to penetrate international markets further  we must either expand the number of distributors who sell licenses of our software or increase our direct international sales presence 
as we increase our direct international sales presence  our sales efforts may be delayed as we begin our local sales activities and we may incur higher personnel costs that may not result in additional revenue 
these costs and the time to establish a local sales presence could harm our operating results 
we may not realize corresponding growth in operating margins from growth in international sales due to the higher costs of these sales 
we have increased our sales and support resources in europe over the last two years and have established offices in england  france  germany  india  israel and singapore 
however  the expected returns on those investments have not been realized  primarily due to the economic slowdown 
to date  we have relied primarily on international distributors in asia and have only recently begun to employ direct sales personnel in singapore and india 
even if we expand our direct and indirect international selling efforts  our efforts may not create or increase international market demand for our software or generate revenue sufficient to recoup the cost of this expansion 
if we experience losses in the future  the market price of our common stock could decline 
although we had net income for the past four fiscal years  we may incur losses in the future 
in order to fund our growth and implement our strategies  we must continue to increase our investment in research and development  sales and marketing and other operations 
as a result  we will need to generate significant revenue to maintain profitability 
if we do not maintain profitability  the market price of our common stock may decline  perhaps substantially 
we anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially in the next months as we increase our sales and marketing activities  particularly by expanding our direct sales force  continue to increase the size and number of locations of our support organization  continue to invest in research and development to enhance our existing products and technologies and develop new circuit simulation and analysis products  and implement additional internal systems  develop additional infrastructure and hire additional management to keep pace with our growth 
continue to defend ourselves vigorously against the three lawsuits brought by synopsys 
any failure to significantly increase our revenue as we implement our strategies would also harm our ability to maintain profitability and could negatively impact the market price of our common stock 
if we are not able to preserve the value of our software s intellectual property  our business will suffer 
our software is differentiated from that of our competitors by our internally developed technology 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property  other vendors could sell circuit simulation and analysis software with capabilities similar to ours  and this could reduce demand for our software 
we protect our intellectual property through a combination of copyright  patent  trade secret and trademark laws 
we have a patent program and to date have filed two patent applications  one of which was issued by the us patent and trademark office in june we generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  consultants and corporate partners  and generally seek to control access to our intellectual property and the distribution of our software  documentation and other proprietary information 
however  we believe that these measures afford only limited protection 
others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology or design around the copyrights and trade secrets we own 
unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our software or technology 
policing unauthorized use of our software is difficult and expensive  and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as those in the united states 
if our means of protecting our proprietary rights is inadequate or ineffective  our business may be severely harmed 
a protracted infringement claim or a significant damage award would adversely impact our operating results 
substantial litigation and threats of litigation regarding intellectual property rights exist in our industry 
we expect that circuit simulation and analysis design software may be increasingly subject to third party infringement claims as the number of competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
we are not aware of any valid proprietary rights of third parties that our software infringes 
we are currently a defendant in three lawsuits brought by synopsys 
additional third parties other than synopsys may claim that we infringe their intellectual property rights 
any claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming to defend  result in costly litigation and or damage awards  divert our management s attention and resources  cause customers to cancel or delay orders  cause product shipment delays  or require us to seek to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
these royalty or licensing agreements may not be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
a successful claim of product infringement against us or our failure to license the infringed or similar technology could adversely affect our business 
we would not be able to sell licenses of the impacted software without exposing ourselves to litigation risk and damages or we may be required to redevelop the software and incur significant additional expense 
because we expect to derive substantially all of our revenue from hsim in fiscal  anything that would limit our ability to license hsim would harm our business 
any potential dispute involving our intellectual property could include our customers and strategic partners  which could trigger our indemnification obligations with them and result in substantial expense 
in any potential dispute involving our intellectual property  our customers and strategic partners could also become the target of litigation 
this could trigger our technical support and indemnification obligations in our license agreements which could result in substantial expense to us 
in addition to the time and expense required for us to supply such support or indemnification to our customers and strategic partners  any such litigation could severely disrupt or shut down the business of our customers and strategic partners  which in turn could hurt our relations with our customers and strategic partners and cause licenses for our software to decrease 
significant errors in our software  our inability to correct errors or the failure of our software to conform to specifications could result in our customers demanding refunds from us or asserting claims for damages against us 
because our circuit simulation and analysis software is complex  our software could fail to perform as anticipated 
further  significant errors in our software may be found in the future or errors may not be corrected satisfactorily for our customers 
the detection of any significant errors may result in product liability claims or damage awards  the loss of or delay in market acceptance and sales of our software  injury to our reputation and hindered market acceptance of our software  diversion of development resources from new software to fix errors in existing software  costs of corrective actions or returns of defective software  reduction in maintenance or time based license renewal rates  or delays in shipping dates for our software 
we have warranted that our software will operate in accordance with our user documentation 
if our software fails to conform to these specifications  customers could demand a refund for the purchase price or assert and collect on claims for damages 
moreover  because our software is used in connection with other vendors products that are used to design complex nanometer scale semiconductors  significant liability claims may be asserted against us if our software does not work properly individually or with other vendors products 
our agreements with customers typically contain provisions intended to limit our exposure to liability claims 
however  these limitations may not preclude all potential claims and we have only minimal insurance against such liabilities 
regardless of their merit  liability claims could require us to spend significant time and expense in litigation and divert management s attention from other business pursuits 
if successful  a product liability claim could require us to pay significant damages 
any claims  whether or not successful  could seriously damage our reputation and our business 
because our strategy to expand our international operations is subject to uncertainties  we may not be able to enter new markets outside north america or generate a significant level of revenue or profit margins from those markets 
customers outside north america accounted for  and of our total revenue in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
we plan to increase our international sales activities  but we have limited experience marketing and directly licensing our software internationally 
we have direct sales offices in england  france  germany  india  israel  singapore and taiwan  and rely primarily on indirect sales in asia 
although our sales contracts provide for payment for our software licenses in united states dollars  our expenses incurred in foreign locations are generally denominated in the applicable local currency 
to date we have not undertaken any foreign currency hedging transactions  and as a result  our future expense levels from international operations may be unpredictable due to exchange rate fluctuations 
our international operations are subject to other risks  including the impact of recessions in economies outside north america  difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations  foreign currency fluctuations  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  changes in import or export duties  quotas or controls  which could prevent us from shipping our software into markets outside north america  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection and longer collection periods  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  proper maintenance of corporate formalities by our foreign subsidiaries  potentially adverse tax consequences  including the impact of expiry of tax holidays  and political and economic instability 
we intend to pursue strategic relationships but these efforts could substantially divert management attention and resources 
in order to establish strategic relationships with semiconductor technology leaders and leading electronic design automation tool providers  we may need to expend significant resources and will need to commit a significant amount of management time and attention  with no guarantee of success 
we may be unable to establish key industry strategic relationships if any of the following occur potential industry partners become concerned about our ability to protect their intellectual property  potential industry partners develop their own solutions to address circuit simulation and analysis of complex nanometer scale semiconductors  our competitors establish relationships with industry partners with which we seek to establish a relationship  or potential industry partners attempt to restrict our ability to enter into relationships with their competitors 
we have only recently entered into our current strategic relationships 
these relationships may not continue or be successful 
we also may be unable to find additional industry partners that are suitable 
we may not be able to expand our proprietary technologies if we do not make acquisitions or investments or fail to successfully integrate the acquired companies with our business 
to expand our proprietary technologies  we may acquire or make investments in complementary businesses  technologies or products if appropriate opportunities arise 
we may be unable to identify suitable acquisition or investment candidates at reasonable prices or on reasonable terms  or complete future acquisitions or investments  any of which could slow our growth strategy 
we may have difficulty integrating the products  personnel  culture  ideologies or technologies of any acquisitions we might make 
these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management and employees and increase our expenses 
in addition  the key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us and if our customers are uncertain about our ability to operate on a combined basis  they could delay or cancel orders for our software 
furthermore  we may have to incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any future acquisition  the issuance of which would be dilutive to our existing stockholders 
we also could have difficulty in assimilating the acquired company s or division s personnel and operations  which could negatively affect our operating results 
the markets for complex nanometer scale semiconductors are evolving rapidly and if these markets do not develop and expand as we anticipate  the demand for our software and our revenue would decline 
we expect that a substantial majority of our revenue will continue to come from sales of hsim in fiscal we depend on the growing use of circuit simulation and analysis software to design complex nanometer scale semiconductors for use in portable consumer electronics  networking equipment and other applications 
the market for complex nanometer scale semiconductors may not grow if customers choose to use other types of semiconductors that might be more affordable or available with shorter time to market schedules 
this could cause electronic equipment manufacturers to limit the number of new complex nanometer scale semiconductors they design and would reduce their need for our software 
if demand for our software were to decline  we may choose to lower the prices of our software or we may sell fewer licenses and have lower maintenance renewal rates 
in addition  if equipment manufacturers do not widely adopt the use of complex nanometer scale semiconductors or if there is a wide acceptance of alternative semiconductors that provide enhanced capabilities  the market price of our stock could decline due to our lower operating results or investors assessment that the growth potential for licenses of our software is limited 
the markets for complex nanometer scale semiconductors are evolving rapidly and we cannot predict their potential sizes or future growth rates 
our success in generating revenue in these evolving markets will depend on  among other things  our ability to educate potential customers about the benefits of complex nanometer scale semiconductors and the use of our software to design them  establish and maintain relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers  electronic equipment designers  portable consumer electronic manufacturers  networking equipment and other electronics companies  utilize our research and development efforts to anticipate and adapt to evolving markets  and predict and base our software on technology that ultimately becomes industry standard 
we face competition from internally developed semiconductor design software and if our customers elect to continue to use internally designed tools  our business may suffer 
we face significant competition from internal design software groups of semiconductor manufacturers 
these internal groups compete with us for access to potential customers circuit simulation and analysis software budgets and may eventually compete with us to supply circuit simulation and analysis software to other semiconductor manufacturers 
we cannot assure you that internal groups will not expand their internally designed tools to compete directly with ours or actively sell their internally designed tools to other semiconductor manufacturers or  if they do  that we will be able to compete against them successfully 
our revenue could be reduced if large electronic design automation companies make acquisitions in order to utilize their extensive distribution capabilities with our competitors products 
large electronic design automation vendors  such as cadence design  mentor graphics or synopsys  may acquire or establish cooperative relationships with our other current competitors  including private companies 
for example  synopsys acquired numerical technologies  inc  a provider of sub wavelength lithography enabling technology  in february  and innologic systems  inc  a provider of memory and full custom equivalence checking technology  in june because large electronic design automation vendors have significant financial and organizational resources  they may be able to further penetrate our markets by leveraging the technology and expertise of smaller companies and utilizing their own extensive distribution channels 
we expect that the electronic design automation product industry will continue to consolidate 
for example  cadence completed its acquisition of celestry design technologies  inc  a provider of silicon modeling and circuit simulation tools  in january  getchip  inc  a provider of advanced nanometer scale synthesis technology  in april and verplex systems  inc  a provider of formal verification electronic design software  in august it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share  which would harm our business and financial prospects 
we may not be able to compete effectively if our software is delayed or does not incorporate new required features 
our future success depends on our ability to enhance existing software  develop and introduce new products  satisfy user requirements  meet industry standards and achieve market acceptance 
we may not successfully identify new product opportunities or develop and bring new products to market in a timely and cost effective manner 
significant delays in our new software releases or significant problems or delays in enhancing existing products to keep pace with new design techniques for complex nanometer scale semiconductors could seriously damage our business 
we have  from time to time  experienced delays in the scheduled introduction of new and enhanced software and we may experience similar delays in the future 
for example  in early we experienced delays in the development of a new product which caused us to revise our expected release date for this product by several months 
more recently  we have also delayed the release of another product in order to allow for an extended beta testing period 
we cannot assure you that we will not experience additional difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and marketing of this software or that our new software and product enhancements will achieve market acceptance 
if we are unable to develop  introduce and successfully market new or enhanced software in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements  our business  operating results and financial condition may be harmed 
we may sell fewer licenses of our products if other vendors products are no longer compatible with ours 
our ability to sell licenses of our software depends in part on the compatibility of our software with other vendors software and hardware products 
these vendors may change their products so that they will no longer be compatible with our software 
if that were to happen  our business and future operating results would suffer if we were no longer able to offer commercially viable or competitive products 
we do not have a consulting staff  and our revenue may suffer if customers demand extensive consulting or other support services 
our software is designed to be deployed quickly and easily by our customers and to require limited support from us 
many of our competitors offer extensive consulting services in addition to circuit simulation and analysis products 
if we introduce software that requires extensive consulting services for specific designs  or if our customers wish to purchase a broad spectrum of software and services that includes extensive consulting services from a single vendor  we would be required to change our business model and cost structure to provide consulting services 
specifically  we would be required to hire and train consultants or outsource the required consulting services 
if these events were to occur  our future gross margin would likely suffer because of the added expense of hiring and retaining consulting personnel 
our common stock is subject to substantial price and volume fluctuations due to a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control  and those fluctuations may prevent our stockholders from reselling our common stock at a profit 
the securities markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations recently and the market prices of the securities of technology companies have been especially volatile 
this market volatility  as well as general economic or political conditions  could reduce the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance 
in addition  our operating results could be below the expectations of investment analysts and investors and  in response  the market price of our common stock may decrease significantly and prevent investors from reselling their shares of our common stock at or above the price at which they purchased the shares 
for example  in april we reported our financial results for the three months ended march   which were below previous guidance and market expectations 
as a result  the stock price of our common stock was adversely impacted 
our growth could place a significant strain on our management systems and resources and we may be unable to effectively control our costs and implement our business strategies as a result 
our total number of employees was as of september   and we expect our headcount to double over the next to months 
our productivity and the quality of our software may be adversely affected if we do not integrate  train and motivate our new employees quickly and effectively and manage our resources efficiently 
we also cannot be sure that our revenue will continue to grow at a sufficient rate to absorb the costs associated with the increased personnel 
we expect that any future growth we experience will continue to place a significant strain on our management  systems and resources 
to manage the anticipated growth of our operations  we will be required to hire  train  manage and retain additional qualified personnel  especially software engineers and sales staff  improve existing and implement new operational  financial and management information controls  reporting systems and procedures  maintain a high level of customer service and support  and establish relationships with additional corporate partners and maintain our existing relationships 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we develop products primarily in the united states and sell those products primarily in north america  europe and japan 
our revenue for sales outside of north america was approximately  and of total revenue for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
as all of our sales are currently made in united states dollars  a strengthening of the united states dollar could make our software less competitive in foreign markets 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of united states interest rates  particularly since the majority of our investments are in short term instruments 
we expect that our interest income will continue to be negatively affected by recent declines in short term interest rates 
a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical movement in interest rates applied to our cash equivalent and short term investments balances at september  would change interest income by approximately  on an annual basis 
however  due to the nature of our short term investments  we have concluded that we do not have material market risk exposure 
we invest funds in excess of current operating requirements in short term tax exempt and taxable instruments that meet high credit quality standards  as specified in our investment policy 
the policy also limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer or type of instrument 
as of september   our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments primarily consisted of the following instruments obligations of the united states government and its agencies  investment grade state and local government obligations  securities of united states corporations rated a or p by standard poor s or moody s equivalents  and or money market funds  deposits or notes issued or guaranteed by united states and non united states commercial banks meeting certain credit rating and net worth requirements with maturities of less than one year
