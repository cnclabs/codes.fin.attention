item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business environment and risk factors management s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements contained within this report  including the notes thereto 
our future operating results may be affected by various trends and factors that are beyond our control 
these include the factors set forth in forward looking statements 
accordingly  past results and trends may not be reliable indicators of future results or trends 
with the exception of historical information  the matters discussed below include forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
we caution readers that a number of important factors discussed in this report could affect our actual results and cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements 
overview we are a financial holding company offering full service community banking and financial services through locations in the kansas city metropolitan area  southeastern kansas  western missouri  the omaha  nebraska metropolitan area  the tulsa  oklahoma metropolitan area  and in colorado springs  colorado 
our presence in kansas consists of six locations in the kansas city metro area and four locations in southeast kansas 
we operate two locations in western missouri  four in the metropolitan area of omaha  nebraska  one in colorado springs  colorado  and an insurance agency in the tulsa  oklahoma metropolitan area 
our total assets over the past six years have more than doubled  growing from million at january  to million december  the growth in assets and the corresponding increase in earnings were achieved primarily through purchases of branches of large banks  the purchase of community banks  and branch expansion 
our branch expansion includes growth at existing branches as well as the opening of new branches 
accompanying the acquisition growth were increased operating expenses resulting from growth as well as increases in provisions for loan losses and amortization expense of intangible assets related to acquisitions and in some instances issuance of shares of common stock in conjunction with the acquisitions 
this has generally resulted in level earnings per share during the past six years with occasional year over year increases in earnings per share in years without significant acquisitions  such as the current year ended december  our experience is that it takes between to months to realize meaningful net income improvements from acquisitions and expansion due to our emphasis on retaining key employees rather than the immediate implementation of cost reduction measures 
at december  total assets were million  an increase of million  or from million at december  our total assets were million  an increase of million or from million in total assets at december  the increase in was primarily the result of the colorado national bank acquisition in the third quarter of  with assets of million at acquisition 
net income totaled million for the year ended december  versus million for the year ended december  the increase for compared to was primarily the result of a  gain on sale of loan revenue from the favorable interest rate environment for home re financings and new home purchases  and a  decrease in goodwill expense due to the adoption of sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
net income totaled million for the year ended december  versus million for december  the increase for compared to was primarily the result of a million increase in non interest income and a million increase in net interest income 
these increases were offset by an increase in provision for loan loss expense of  and an increase in non interest expense of million 
critical accounting policies our accounting and reporting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the unites states of america 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the statement of financial condition and revenues and expenses for the period 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses 
allowance for loan losses we establish allowances for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses charged to operations is based on management s judgment of current economic conditions and the credit risk of the loan portfolio 
management believes that this allowance is adequate for the losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on borrowers conditions and changes in economic conditions 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of the examination process  periodically review this allowance and may require us to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgment about information available to them at the time of their examination 
analysis of the results of operations net interest income our income is derived primarily from net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income  principally from loans  investment securities  federal funds sold  and interest bearing deposits  and interest expense  principally on customer deposits and other borrowings 
changes in net interest income result from changes in volume and interest rates earned and expensed 
volume refers to the average dollar levels of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the following tables set forth the average balances of interest earnings assets and interest bearing liabilities  as well as the amount of interest income or interest expense and the average rate for each category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities on a tax equivalent basis assuming a tax rate for the periods indicated

the tax effects for the years ended december    and were   and  respectively 
total interest income on a tax equivalent basis for was million  representing a decrease of million or  from million for the decrease was primarily the result of a million decrease in interest income on loans receivable 
interest income on loans receivable decreased due to a basis point decrease in the yield on the loans receivable to in from in  as well as a million decrease in the average balance of loans receivable to million in from million in the decrease in the yield of our loans receivable was the result of a decrease of basis points in the national prime interest rate from january  also contributing to the decrease in yield was the decrease of our average balance of loans receivable  primarily due to a decrease in our one to four family loan portfolio  as customers re financed loans due to favorable long term fixed mortgage interest rates 
we typically sell fixed rate loans to the secondary market instead of maintaining the loans in our loan portfolio 
interest income from taxable investment securities increased million for the year compared to  primarily due to a million purchase of short term mortgage backed securities from the proceeds of long term borrowings from the federal home loan bank 
this transaction was initiated in the third quarter of as an interest rate risk management strategy 
the federal home loan bank borrowings  which carry an average rate of  consisted of million in convertible advances with a libor strike and million in convertible securities with a libor strike 
the intent of the transaction was to increase the asset sensitivity of our balance sheet to benefit from an increase in interest rates and borrow long term borrowings during the period of historical low interest rates 
while we believe interest rates may decrease or stay relatively low for the next twelve months causing an accelerated decrease in the initial spread on this transaction of approximately basis points  we anticipate the next major trend in interest rates to be one of rising interest rates enabling us to increase net interest income 
the yield on taxable investment securities decreased basis points to in from in the decrease in the average rate of investment securities is related to the decrease in market interest rates since january of the decrease in interest rates since january of has caused many of our portfolio s issuers of securities to retire or prepay their securities prior to maturity since they have been able to refinance at lower rates 
because of these early prepayments  we have re invested the proceeds in new securities  which yield lower interest rates reflecting the decline in market interest rates 
total interest expense was million for  a million  or decrease  from million in the decrease in interest expense was primarily related to the decrease in interest rates since january of the average rate paid on savings deposits and interest bearing checking balances decreased basis points to in from in and the average rate paid on time deposits decreased basis points to in from in the average balance of federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase decreased million as a result of our reduction in overnight federal funds purchased due to increased liquidity resulting from the decrease in loans receivable balances 
the average rate paid on federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase decreased basis points to for from for the average balance of notes payable and federal home loan bank advances increased million as we borrowed million in long term borrowings from the federal home loan bank at approximately and invested the proceeds into short term mortgage backed securities 
the average rate on notes payable and federal home loan bank advances decreased basis points to during from during the average balance of our obligated mandatory redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trust holding solely subordinated debentures increased million due to the issuance of million in cumulative trust preferred securities in august of in conjunction with the purchase of colorado national bank in september of as a result of the changes described above  the net interest income on a tax equivalent basis increased to million for  representing an increase of million  or  from million during total interest income on a tax equivalent basis for totaled million  representing a decrease of  or  from million for the decrease was primarily the result of a million decrease in interest income on average taxable investment securities 
interest income on taxable investment securities decreased due to a basis point decrease in the yield on the securities to in from in  as well as a million decrease in the average balance of taxable investment securities to million in from million in during the year  our average balance of taxable investment securities decreased primarily due to investment securities being called from us by the debt issuers  as the debt issuers chose to re finance the debt at more favorable rates  and from accelerated principal payments received from our mortgage backed securities 
we re invested the proceeds from these securities at lower yields than the original investments  which resulted in a decrease in the overall yield in the portfolio 
offsetting the decrease in interest income from taxable investment securities was an increase in interest income on loans receivable of  the increase was due to a million increase in the average balance of loans receivable to million in  generated by million of average internal loan growth and million in average loans receivable purchased with the acquisition of colorado national bank in third quarter of the average rate on loans receivable decreased basis points due to the decrease in interest rates during the year 
total interest expense was million for  a million  or decrease  from million in the decrease in interest expense was primarily related to the decrease in interest rates during as the federal reserve lowered the federal funds interest rate basis points during the year 
we decreased the average rate paid on savings deposits and interest bearing checking balances basis points to in from in and the average rate paid on time deposits basis points to in from in the average balance of federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase decreased million as a result of our reduction in overnight federal funds purchased due to increased liquidity resulting from the decrease in investment security balances

changes in interest income or interest expense attributable to volume changes are calculated by multiplying the change in volume by the prior fiscal years average interest rate 
the changes in interest income or interest expense attributable to change in interest rates are calculated by multiplying the change in interest rate by the prior fiscal years average volume 
the changes in interest income or interest expense attributable to the combined impact of changes in volume and change in interest rate are calculated by multiplying the change in rate by the change in volume

provision for loan losses a provision for losses on loans is charged to earning to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level considered appropriate by management based on historical loss experience  the volume and type of lending conducted  the status of past due principal and interest payments  general economic conditions  particularly as such conditions relate to our market areas  and other factors related to the collectibility of our loan portfolio 
after considering the above factors  management recorded a provision for loan losses on loans totaling million for the years ended and  and million for the year ended the provision recorded for the year ended was predicated upon the level of net charge offs during the year of million along with an increase in the commercial  construction and land development  and commercial real estate loans as a percent of total loans in the portfolio 
these loans required a higher allowance for loan losses 
non interest income the following table sets forth non interest income for the indicated periods

management believes that the loans refinanced and originated in will not keep pace with that of  but cannot estimate the magnitude of the decreased gain 
decreases in the gain can be expected to result in a direct decrease in our net income 
income from investment in bank owned life insurance increased  during primarily due to our million investment in bank owned life insurance in july brokerage service revenue increased  or for  compared to the increase was primarily due to a transition in sales staff during the year 
however  with the uncertainty in the equity markets  we do not expect to achieve a similar year over year increase in brokerage service revenue going forward

we typically sell fixed rate one to four family loans to the secondary market instead of holding them in our portfolio 
offsetting the decrease in our one to four family loan portfolio was the favorable results of our continued allocation of resources to the commercial  construction and land development  and commercial real estate markets 
our commitment to focus our resources on internal loan growth in the commercial  construction and land development  and commercial real estate markets produced internal loan growth of million  a increase in these loans compared to offsetting this growth was our decision to exit our low margin dealer paper business in decreasing installment loans by million

we also exited the dealer paper business and sold our credit card portfolio during we believe that our philosophy in extending credit is relatively conservative in nature  with a presumption that most credit should have both a primary and secondary source of repayment  and that the primary source should generally be operating cash flows  while the secondary source should generally be collateral or guarantees of principals  for business obligations

non performing loans consist of loans days or more delinquent and still accruing interest  non accrual loans  and restructured loans 
when  in the opinion of management  a reasonable doubt exists as to the collectibility of interest  regardless of the delinquency status of a loan  the accrual of interest income is discontinued and any interest accrued to date is reversed through a charge to interest income 
while a loan is on non accrual status  it is our policy that interest income is recognized only after payment in full of the past due principal 
generally  management places loans which are greater than days past due on non accrual

non performing assets have steadily increased from along with the increase in our total assets 
non performing assets as a percent of total assets increased to at december   compared to at december   and at december  non performing assets will generally increase in times of economic uncertainty or stress 
management believes the level of non performing assets may increase if the economic weakness experienced in continues in  although the magnitude of any increase in non performing loans is not determinable 
impaired loans we consider a loan to be impaired when it is deemed probable by management that we will be unable to collect all contractual principal and interest payments in accordance with the terms of the original loan agreement 
however  when determining whether a loan is impaired  management also considers the loan documentation  the current ratio of the loan s balance to collateral value  and the borrower s present financial position 
included as impaired loans are all loans contractually delinquent days or more and all loans upon which accrual of interest has been suspended 
at december   we had impaired loans totaling million  which have related specific reserves of million 
this compares to million of impaired loans  which had related specific reserves of million at december  the increase in non performing loans was primarily the result of a million non accrual agricultural loan in the kansas city metropolitan area 
the loan was placed on non accrual status for payment delinquency 
as indicated above  the loan is well secured by real estate and we are working with the borrower to liquidate the real estate 
the average recorded investment in impaired loans during the year ended december  was million 
interest income collected and recognized on impaired loans during the period the loans were considered to be impaired for totaled  impaired loans will generally increase in times of economic uncertainty or stress 
management believes the level of impaired loans could increase if the economic weakness experienced in our market area during continues in allowance for loan losses management maintains its allowance for loan losses based on industry standards  historical experience and an evaluation of economic conditions 
we regularly review delinquencies and loan portfolio quality 
based upon these factors  management makes various assumptions and judgments about the ultimate collectibility of the loan portfolio and provides an allowance for potential loan losses based upon a percentage of the outstanding balances and for specific loans if their ultimate collectibility is considered questionable 
since certain lending activities involve greater risks  the percentage applied to specific loan types may vary 
the allowance is increased by provisions for loan losses and reduced by loans charged off  net of recoveries 
the following table sets forth information regarding changes in the allowance for loan losses for the periods indicated 
year ended december  dollars in thousands average total loans     total loans at end of period     allowance at beginning of year     loans charged off real estate one to four family construction other commercial lease financing receivables installment and other total charge offs   recoveries real estate one to four family construction other commercial lease financing receivables installment and other total recoveries net charge offs   provision for loan losses     allowance related to acquisitions allowance at end of period      ratio of net charge offs to average total loans allowance to total loans at end of period allowance to nonperfoming loans the allowance for loan losses has increased steadily over the last five years due to the increase in the commercial  construction and land development  and commercial real estate loans as a percent of total loans in the portfolio 
in our experience  these loans required a higher allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan loss to total loans at december  increased to primarily due to provisions taken for our internal loan growth in commercial credits 
net charge offs were million for the year ended  compared to million for the year ended net charge offs for primarily consisted of  in commercial loans   in installment loans  and  in one to four family real estate loans 
commercial loan net charge offs were primarily composed of five credits totaling  these credits were from various industries in our markets including an auto leasing company  a retail packaging manufacturer  a convenience store  an auto body shop  and fraudulent receivables purchased 
one to four family net charge offs was also the result of one larger credit  where we released the mortgage in error and the customer filed for bankruptcy 
installment net charge offs have increased over the past few years at approximately of installment net charge offs to total installment loans 
management has taken steps to decrease this percentage by tightening our lending standards since early we also exited the dealer paper business and sold our credit card portfolio during as a result  the net charge off percentage for installment loans has improved to for  compared to for the  increase in net charge offs for  compared to was primarily related to a  increase in installment loan net charge offs   of commercial loan net charge offs  and  net charge offs from construction loans secured by real estate 
the  increase in installment loan net charge offs was partially attributable to additional credit card portfolio charge offs in preparation for the sale of the credit card portfolio  which was disposed of during the second quarter of  charge offs generated in conjunction with normal review and analysis which was completed after the merger of the bank charters occurring during the first quarter of  and a general increase in installment loan charge offs 
the  increase in commercial loans was largely the result of three large credits totaling  the  increase in construction loans secured by real estate was largely related to a real estate development loan of  charged off during the year 
our lending personnel are responsible for continuous monitoring of the loan portfolio 
additionally  since  we have performed an independent loan review process  which reviews the loan portfolio on a quarterly basis to determine compliance with loan policy  including the appropriateness of risk ratings assigned to individual loans  as well as the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is based primarily on management s estimates of probable loan losses from the foregoing processes and historical experience 
our loan portfolio is also subject to periodic examination by regulatory agencies 
these agencies may require charge offs or additions to the allowance based upon their judgments about information available at the time of their examination 
the following tables present an allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan category as of the dates indicated 
the allocation tables should not be interpreted as an indication of the specific amounts  by loan classification  to be charged to the allowance 
management believes that the table may be a useful device for assessing the adequacy of the allowances as a whole 
the table has been derived in part by applying historical loan loss ratios to both internally classified loans and the portfolio as a whole to determine the allocation of the loan losses attributable to each category of loans

the allowance for loan losses allocated to loans secured by real estate other increased  at december  compared to december  due to the increase of million in these loans during the year 
the allowance for loan losses allocated to commercial and agricultural loans decreased  at december  compared to december  due to an decrease in the specific allowance allocated to the portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses allocated to installment and other loans decreased  at december  compared to december  due to the decrease of million in installment loans 
investments we invest a portion of our available funds in short term and long term instruments  including federal funds sold and investment securities 
our investment portfolio is designed to provide liquidity for cash flow requirements  to assist in managing interest rate risk  and to provide collateral for certain public deposits and other borrowing arrangements 
during  we initiated an interest rate risk management strategy through a transaction in which we purchased million in short term mortgage backed investment securities with million in long term borrowings from the federal home loan bank 
the federal home loan bank borrowings  which carry an average rate of  consisted of million in convertible advances with a libor strike and million in convertible securities with a libor strike 
the intent of the transaction is to increase the asset sensitivity of our balance sheet to benefit from an increase in interest rates and borrow long term borrowings during the period of historical low interest rates 
while we believe interest rates may decrease or stay relatively low for the next twelve months causing an accelerated decrease in the initial spread on this transaction of approximately basis points  we anticipate the next major trend in interest rates to be one of rising interest rates enabling us to increase net interest income

as members of the fhlb  our subsidiary banks are entitled to borrow funds from the fhlb and are required to own fhlb stock in an amount determined by a formula based upon total assets and fhlb borrowings 
our subsidiary banks may use fhlb borrowings to supplement deposits as a source of funds 
at december   fhlb borrowings aggregated million  compared to million at december   and million at december  the increase of million in fhlb advances at december   compared to december   was the result of a transaction  where we borrowed million in fhlb advances during and purchased short term mortgage backed investment securities

fhlb borrowings are collateralized by fhlb stock and certain qualifying mortgage loans of our subsidiary banks 
a variety of borrowing terms and maturities can be chosen from the fhlb 
maturities available range generally from one day up to years 
interest rates can be either fixed or variable and prepayment options are available if desired 
the fhlb offers both amortizing and non amortizing advances

capital resources we monitor compliance with bank and financial holding company regulatory capital requirements  focusing primarily on risk based guidelines 
under the risk based capital method of capital measurement  the ratio computed is dependent upon the amount and composition of assets recorded on the balance sheet  and the amount and composition of off balance sheet items  in addition to the level of capital 
included in the risk based capital method are two measures of capital adequacy  core capital and total capital  which consist of core and secondary capital 
core capital  also known as tier capital  generally includes common shareholders equity  perpetual preferred stock and minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries  less goodwill and intangible assets 
no more than of core capital elements may consist of cumulative preferred stock 
total risk based capital  also known as tier capital  generally includes the allowance for loan losses limited to of weighted risk assets  certain forms of perpetual preferred stock  as well as hybrid capital instruments

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk liquidity we continuously forecast and manage our liquidity in order to satisfy cash flow requirements of depositors  borrowers  and our own cash flow needs 
we have developed internal and external sources of liquidity to meet our continued growth needs 
these include  but are not limited to  the ability to raise deposits through branch promotional campaigns  maturity of overnight funds  short term investment securities classified as available for sale and draws on credit facilities established through the federal home loan bank 
our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents and investment securities available for sale

at december  and december   these liquid assets totaled million and million  respectively 
management believes our sources of liquidity are adequate to meet expected cash needs for the foreseeable future 
asset and liability management asset and liability management refers to management s efforts to minimize fluctuations in net interest income caused by interest rate changes 
this is accomplished by managing the repricing of interest rate sensitive interest bearing assets and interest bearing liabilities 
controlling the maturity of repricing of an institution s liabilities and assets in order to minimize interest rate risk is commonly referred to as gap management 
close matching of repricing assets and liabilities will normally result in little change in net interest income when interest rates change 
we monitor our assets and liability mix monthly in an effort to maintain consistent earnings performance through control of interest rate risk 
below is a static gap schedule as of december  this is just one of several tools which may be used to measure and manage interest rate sensitivity 
interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are presented below within selected time intervals based on their repricing and maturity characteristics 
in this view  the sensitivity position is perfectly matched when an equal amount of assets and liabilities reprice during any given time period 
excess assets or liabilities repricing in a given time period results in the interest rate gap shown in the table 
a positive gap indicates more assets than liabilities will reprice in that time period  while a negative gap indicates more liabilities than assets will reprice 
static gap analysis at december  months or less through months through months through months through months more than months total dollars in thousands interest earning assets loans receivable  net of unearned income    investment securities available for sale    federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits  total interest earning assets     interest bearing liabilities savings deposits and interest bearing checking  time deposits under      time deposits over      federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase  federal home loan bank advances     notes payable    total interest bearing liabilities    periodic repricing gap cumulative repricing gap     periodic repricing gap as a percent of interest earning assets cumulative repricing gap as a percent of interest earning assets the table indicates that we are liability sensitive in the less than three month period  the four through month period  the through month period  and are asset sensitive for all other periods 
this means that during the first two period classifications  interest bearing liabilities reprice faster than interest earning assets  thereby improving net interest income when rates are falling and reducing net interest income when rates are rising 
while the static gap method is a widely used measure of interest sensitivity  it is not  in management s opinion  the only indicator of our rate sensitivity 
the following table indicates that at december   if there had been a sudden and sustained increase in prevailing market interest rates  our interest income would be expected to increase  while a decrease in rates would indicate a decrease in income 
change in interest rates net interest income decrease increase percent change dollars in thousands basis point rise   basis point rise  base rate scenario  basis point decline   basis point decline   we also believe we are appropriately positioned for future interest rate movements  although we may experience some fluctuation in net interest income due to short term timing differences between the repricing of assets and liabilities
