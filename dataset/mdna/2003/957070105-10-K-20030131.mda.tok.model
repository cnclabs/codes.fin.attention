all of these proceeds were used to repay outstanding borrowings 
see liquidity and capital resources for further information on these recent developments 
discontinued operations during fiscal  the company sold certain of its franchise agent and company owned medical offices and entered into a termination agreement with one of its medical licensees 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal the company completed the sale of the remaining medical business to intrepid usa inc intrepid under an asset purchase agreement 
under the terms of the sale  the company retained the trade and medicare accounts receivable balances as well as the due from licensee balances 
in fiscal  the company recorded after tax losses relating to discontinued operations of million or per share 
during fiscal  the company recorded additional after tax losses relating to discontinued operations of million or per share  primarily resulting from lower than expected settlements of medicare cost reports 
during fiscal  the company recorded additional after tax losses relating to discontinued operations of million or per share  primarily due to an unfavorable arbitration award between the company and intrepid 
currently  the company believes it has adequate reserves for estimated liabilities related to the medical business  which primarily relate to pending legal or malpractice liability claims 
however  if actual resolution costs differ materially from those estimated by management  the company would record additional losses or gains in future periods 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the amounts and disclosures reported within the financial statements 
these estimates are evaluated on an ongoing basis by management and generally affect revenue recognition  collectibility of accounts receivable  workers compensation costs  recoverability of intangible assets  income taxes and contingencies and litigation 
management s estimates and assumptions are based on historical experiences and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
however  actual results under circumstances and conditions different than those assumed could result in differences from the estimated amounts in the financial statements 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies are important to the understanding of its business operations and results from operations 
revenue recognition 
the company accounts for revenues and the related direct costs in accordance with emerging issues task force no 
 reporting revenue gross versus net as an agent 
revenues generated by franchise agents and related costs of services are included as part of the company s consolidated sales of services and costs of services  respectively  since the company has the direct contractual relationships with the customers  holds title to the related customer receivables and is the legal employer of the temporary employees 
franchise agents sales represented  and of the company s sales of services for fiscal  and  respectively 
the company also has a licensing program in which the licensee has the direct contractual relationships with the customers  holds title to the related customer receivables and is the legal employer of the temporary employees 
accordingly  sales and costs of services generated by the license operation are not included in the company s consolidated financial statements 
fees are paid to the company based either on a percentage of sales or of gross profit generated by the licensee and such license fees are recorded by the company as license fees 
as at november   only two licensees were in operation and the company is not currently considering granting any future licenses 
collectibility of accounts receivable 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts on its accounts receivable balances for estimated losses projected to result from customers inability to make required payments 
these allowances  which are million at november  and november   are largely determined based on customers financial conditions  the company s historical experiences  interactions with customers and industry trends 
if the financial condition of these customers were to deteriorate to the point it would impair their ability to make the required payments  additional allowances may be required  which could materially adversely affect the financial condition of the company 
workers compensation costs 
the company self insures the deductible amount related to workers compensation claims  which is million per claim  and maintains reserves for these obligations 
these reserves amounted to million and million at november   and november   respectively 
the company accrues the estimated costs of these claims based upon the expected loss rates incurred within the various temporary employment categories provided by the company 
annually  the company obtains an independent actuarially determined calculation of the estimated costs of claims actually made to date  as well as claims incurred but not yet reported 
the resulting calculation is partially based on the company s historical loss development trends as well as overall industry trends 
this annual evaluation is updated twice during the subsequent fiscal year  at times resulting in revisions to recorded liabilities due to developments relating to estimates and assumptions made in the annual evaluation 
whereas management believes the recorded liabilities are adequate  there are inherent limitations in the estimation process whereby future actual loss rates may exceed projected loss rates  which could materially adversely affect the financial condition of the company 
recoverability of intangible assets 
management of the company assesses the recoverability of its long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangible assets  by determining whether the amortization of the asset s carrying value over its remaining life can be recovered through projected undiscounted future cash flows from the asset s operations 
this analysis is performed at least annually  or when there is evidence that recent events have made a recovery of an asset s carrying value unlikely 
when such estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment exists and an impairment loss is recorded in the financial statements 
the company recognized impairment losses of million and million in the fiscal years ended november   and november   respectively 
the company is required to adopt statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets effective at the beginning of the fiscal year with the adoption of sfas no 
 individual goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives will no longer be amortized but instead will be evaluated for impairment by applying a fair value based test upon initial adoption of the statement with impaired assets written down to fair value 
fair value based tests will then be conducted at least annually thereafter 
intangible assets with finite useful lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
the company is currently in the process of completing the initial valuation required within the first six months of sfas no 
s adoption and is not currently able to estimate if adoption will have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations 
it is possible that an additional impairment charge could be recorded based on the results of the fair value approach under the new standard 
income taxes 
the company records income taxes using an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns 
a valuation allowance is established when management determines it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset is not realizable in the foreseeable future on an entity by entity tax basis 
at november   substantially all of the company s net deferred tax assets were offset with a valuation allowance which amounted to million 
the allowance was recorded against net operating loss carryforwards on federal  state and foreign taxes because the company assessed it was unlikely that these net operating losses would be realized in future years 
a valuation allowance equivalent to of the company s deferred tax assets was maintained at november  contingencies and litigation 
in the ordinary course of its business  the company is periodically threatened with or named as a defendant in various lawsuits  claims and pending actions 
the principal risks that the company insures against are workers compensation  general liability  automobile liability  property damage  alternative staffing errors and omissions  fiduciary liability and fidelity losses 
if a potential loss arising from these lawsuits  claims and actions is probable and reasonably estimable  the company records the estimated liability based on circumstances and assumptions existing at the time 
whereas management believes the recorded liabilities are adequate  there are inherent limitations in the estimation process whereby future actual losses may exceed projected losses  which could materially adversely affect the financial condition of the company 
results of continuing operations the table below sets forth  for the three most recent fiscal years  certain results of continuing operations data as a percentage of sales of services and license fees 
fiscal year sales of services license fees total sales of services and license fees costs of services gross profit franchise agents share of gross profit selling and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization income from sales of affiliate operations impairment of intangible assets arbitration award restructuring charges operating income loss from continuing operations interest expense interest income income loss from continuing operations before income taxes income tax provision benefit income loss from continuing operations less than fiscal compared to fiscal sales of services and license fees 
total sales of services decreased million  or for fiscal as compared to fiscal average bill rates increased in fiscal  primarily due to minor inflationary effects in the geographical areas the company operates  but billed hours declined 
fiscal contained fifty two weeks while fiscal contained fifty three  after eliminating the effect of this extra week  billed hours declined as compared to fiscal sales of services declined domestically  increased in the united kingdom and increased in the company s other international operations 
the domestic decline in sales is largely attributable to the united states recent economic recession  which resulted in decreased demand for staffing services across the majority of the company s domestic locations 
domestic pricing pressures which commenced in the latter portion of fiscal continued throughout fiscal  negatively affecting domestic sales of services 
through the first two periods of fiscal  the company has noted an increase in billable hours and an increase in year over year domestic sales of services 
however  no assurances can be made that such continued growth in sales of services will be maintained throughout the remainder of fiscal and beyond 
sales of services in the united kingdom increased primarily due to favorable exchange rates and an increase in average bill rates of  which was largely offset by a decrease in billable hours of 
similarly  other international sales of services increased due to changes in exchange rates and an increase in average bill rates of  offset by a decrease in billable hours of 
license fees are charged to licensed offices based either on a percentage of sales or a percentage of gross profit generated by the license offices 
license fees decreased million or  for fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily due to a decrease in the number of licensees 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  one of the remaining licensees converted to the company s franchise agent program 
additionally  in the first quarter of fiscal  the company purchased the operations of one of its three remaining licensees 
prospectively  the company currently expects license fee revenue in fiscal to be lower than the amounts recognized in fiscal  due to the decreased number of licensees and the fact the company is not seeking to enter into any new license arrangements 
cost of services 
costs of services include hourly wages of temporary employees  employer payroll taxes  state unemployment and workers compensation insurance and other employee related costs 
costs of services decreased million  or  in fiscal as compared to fiscal gross margin declined from in fiscal to in fiscal the decrease in gross margin for fiscal is primarily due to the overall effects of the recent domestic recession  which caused significant pricing pressures throughout fiscal additionally  a decrease in direct placement revenues of million and a decrease in license fees of million caused a million decrease in gross profit 
the company strives to improve gross margin where feasible  however  with the lag in the domestic recession recovery and continued competitive pressures on prices  the opportunities available to increase gross margin are limited 
the company currently estimates that year over year decreases in gross margin will continue through at least the first quarter of fiscal  and possibly beyond 
workers compensation costs were million  or of direct labor for fiscal and million  or of direct labor fiscal recent upward trends in the company s actuarially estimated ultimate costs for all open policy years have resulted in an increase in the company s workers compensation accruals for these estimated costs 
these costs tend to vary depending upon the mix of business between clerical administrative staffing and light industrial staffing 
the company currently estimates that the accrual rates for workers compensation costs will be in the range of to of direct labor for fiscal  as a result of increased workers compensation costs across the industry 
the company reviews interim actuarial estimates and monitors accrual rates to ensure that they remain appropriate in light of loss trends  however  there can be no assurance that the company s programs to control workers compensation costs will be effective or that loss development trends will not require additional increases in workers compensation accruals in future periods 
franchise agents share of gross profit 
franchise agents share of gross profit represents the net distribution paid to franchise agents based either on a percentage of sales or of gross profit generated by the franchise agents operation 
franchise agents share of gross profit decreased million  or  for fiscal as compared to fiscal as a percentage of total sales of services and license fees  franchise agents share of gross profit was for both fiscal and all of the company s franchise operations are located within the united states and the gross profit generated from these operations experienced a similar decline as the overall decline in the company s gross profit during fiscal this decline in gross profit from franchise agents caused the franchise s agents share of gross profit to decline accordingly 
selling and administrative expenses including depreciation and amortization 
selling and administrative expenses decreased million  or for fiscal as compared to fiscal as a percent of sales of services and license fees  selling and administrative expenses  exclusive of depreciation and amortization  decreased from in fiscal to fiscal these decreases are primarily due to cost savings realized from personnel reductions and office closures implemented early in fiscal the company continues to closely monitor its variable costs and evaluate the performance of field offices 
if warranted  additional under performing offices may be closed or consolidated in future periods and additional cost saving measures may be implemented 
however  there can be no assurance that the cost savings implemented from such actions  if enacted  would be sufficient to offset the declining margins 
sales of affiliate operations 
the income on sale of affiliate operations decreased million  or in fiscal as compared to fiscal during fiscal  the company sold its interest in one domestic operation to a franchisor 
this operation had been previously developed and operated as a company owned location 
in fiscal  the company sold its interests in two larger affiliate operations to the respective licensors  generating much larger comparative income 
currently  no dispositions of affiliate operations are contemplated 
however  there can be no assurance that none will occur during fiscal and  if they do  that there will be income from such a disposition 
arbitration award 
during fiscal  the company recorded an accrued liability and related pretax charge of million for the estimated cost of an unfavorable arbitration award  plus other related expenses 
this estimate was based on management s assumptions as to the ultimate outcome of certain future events surrounding the arbitration 
during fiscal  a favorable ruling reduced the arbitration award by million 
currently  the company does not anticipate future  material gains or losses from the ultimate resolution of this arbitration 
restructuring charges 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the company implemented a restructuring plan designed to improve the company s profitability 
this restructuring plan resulted in a fiscal first quarter pre tax charge of million 
the plan included costs associated with the abandonment of certain management information systems which were under development of million  severance and other termination costs of million and lease termination costs of million  related to the company s announced layoffs and office closures 
although the company does continually monitor its financial performance and future cost savings measures may be implemented  it is not currently considering a similar restructuring plan for fiscal interest 
interest expense decreased million  or  for fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to lower debt levels 
interest income decreased million or during the same period as a result of reduced cash levels 
provision benefit for income taxes 
the company recorded an income tax benefit of million on a pre tax loss of million during fiscal this income tax benefit was primarily the result of the reversal of million of the deferred tax valuation allowance 
the valuation allowance was reversed because of a change in the tax law that extended the net operating loss carryback period from to two to five years 
this change allowed the company to carry losses back to earlier tax years resulting in additional tax refunds 
additionally  a tax benefit on the current year pre tax loss was recognized due to the ability to carry this loss back  at the federal statutory rate of  resulting in a tax benefit of million 
partially offsetting these two benefits were certain state and international income tax provisions amounting to million 
at november   the company has maintained valuation allowances equivalent to of its outstanding net deferred tax assets  which amount to million 
whereas it is possible that these deferred tax assets may be realized in the future  there is currently insufficient evidence to support reversing all or a portion of the valuation allowance 
fiscal compared to fiscal sales of services and license fees 
sales of services decreased million  or  for fiscal as compared to fiscal while average bill rates increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal  billed hours declined 
fiscal included fifty three weeks while fiscal included fifty two weeks 
after eliminating the effect of the extra week in fiscal  billed hours declined 
sales of services decreased for domestic business services and for international business services 
the decline in domestic business services reflected the economic slowdown during the year and the resulting recession  which decreased demand for staffing services across the majority of the company s geographic regions 
in the latter portion of fiscal  the economic environment placed strong competitive pressures on pricing which negatively affected sales of services 
global economic conditions and declines in foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted the international results 
excluding the effect of rate fluctuations  fiscal international sales of services decreased as compared to fiscal license fees are charged to licensed offices based either on a percentage of sales or a percentage of gross profit generated by the license offices 
license fees decreased million or  for fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily due to a decrease in licensees 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company purchased the operations of one of its licensees  two licensees converted to the company s franchise agent program  and two licensees closed operations 
in the second quarter of fiscal  two licensees purchased the company s interest in their licensed operations 
cost of services 
costs of services include hourly wages of temporary employees  employer payroll taxes  state unemployment and workers compensation insurance and other employee related costs 
costs of services decreased million  or  for fiscal as compared to fiscal gross margin declined from in fiscal to in fiscal  however  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recorded an additional charge for workers compensation costs of million 
the effective decrease in gross margin for fiscal is primarily due to lower license fees and the overall effects of the domestic recession 
franchise agents share of gross profit 
franchise agents share of gross profit represents the net distribution paid to franchise agents based either on a percentage of sales or of gross profit generated by the franchise agents operation 
franchise agents share of gross profit decreased million  or  for fiscal as compared to fiscal as a percentage of sales of services and license fees  franchise agents share of gross profit increased from during fiscal to for fiscal  reflecting a change in the relative mix of sales of services from company owned  franchise agent and international business services 
selling and administrative expenses including depreciation and amortization 
selling and administrative expenses decreased million  or  for fiscal as compared to fiscal as a percentage of sales of services and license fees  selling and administrative expenses increased from for fiscal to for fiscal fiscal includes million in pre tax charges as a result of the company s terminated recapitalization 
the fiscal increase is primarily the result of declining sales outpacing the extent of reductions in selling and administrative expenditures 
sales of affiliate operations 
the company recognized million of income on the sale of two licensed operations during fiscal no similar sales occurred during fiscal loss on impairment of intangible assets 
management assessed the recoverability of its long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangible assets  by determining whether the amortization of the asset s carrying value over its remaining life could be recovered through projected undiscounted future cash flows from operations 
during fiscal  a number of businesses the company acquired over the past several years were negatively impacted by the economic recession 
based on management s assessment of projected undiscounted future cash flows and estimates of market value based on industry specific multiples  it was determined that the carrying amount of goodwill and other intangibles related to specific acquisitions had been permanently impaired in the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result  the company recorded a pre tax charge of million to write down these assets to estimated current net realizable values 
no similar impairment existed during fiscal arbitration award 
during fiscal  the company recorded an accrued liability and related pretax charge of million for the estimated cost of an unfavorable arbitration award  plus other related expenses 
this estimate was based on management s assumptions as to the ultimate outcome of certain future events surrounding the arbitration 
interest 
interest expense decreased million  or  for fiscal as compared to fiscal due to lower debt levels under the company s senior secured credit facilities 
interest income increased million or during the same period as a result of the short term investment of excess cash from operations 
provision for income taxes 
for fiscal  the company had an income tax provision from continuing operations of approximately million on a pre tax loss of million 
the income tax provision was primarily caused by recognition of million of deferred tax asset valuation allowances 
these allowances were recorded against the tax assets arising from future deduction of federal  state and foreign taxable income because the company reassessed the potential for their realization in future years and concluded it was unlikely they would be realized 
the company retained net deferred tax assets of million from the net operating loss for fiscal because it could realize those by carrying them back to taxes paid in fiscal additionally  the company retained a deferred tax asset of million for fiscal taxable income  because it believed it would realize this as a result of future results of operations 
absent the valuation allowances recognized  the company had an income tax benefit of million  which represents an effective tax benefit rate of 
this income tax benefit is primarily generated by the charge for the loss on intangible asset impairment and arbitration award noted above and partially reduced due to permanent differences 
the effective income tax rate for fiscal was 
liquidity and capital resources historically  the company has financed its operations through cash generated by operating activities and through various forms of debt and equity financing 
the company s principal use of cash is for financing of accounts receivable  particularly during periods of economic upswings and growth and during periods where sales are seasonally high throughout the year 
temporary personnel are generally paid on a weekly basis while payments from customers are generally received to days after billing 
as a result of seasonal fluctuations  accounts receivable balances are historically higher in the fourth fiscal quarter and are generally at their lowest during the first fiscal quarter 
accordingly  short term borrowings used to finance accounts receivable generally follow a similar seasonal pattern 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
during fiscal  the company generated cash from operations in spite of a net loss primarily because a number of expenses were non cash charges  including depreciation  amortization and the provisions for doubtful accounts 
cash generated from operations decreased million as compared fiscal primarily because fiscal included an overall decrease in accounts receivable of million 
during fiscal  collection of outstanding receivables outpaced the growth of receivables generated by declining sales levels  which is largely attributable to the domestic recession 
cash used for capital expenditures  which are primarily for management information systems initiatives  other software  computers and peripherals  and office furniture and equipment  totaled million  million and million for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the decrease in fiscal is primarily due to the company s cessation of further development on an integrated front to back office system  which occurred in the first quarter 
currently  the company anticipates that fiscal cash outflows for management information systems and other capital expenditures will be above fiscal levels  with the bulk of the expenditures related to improvements on its existing management information systems

the covenants also generally restrict  limit or  in certain circumstances prohibit the company with respect to payment of dividends  capital expenditures  disposition of assets  incurrence of debt  mergers and acquisitions  loans to affiliates and purchases of investments 
on october   the first amendment to the multicurrency credit agreement was executed  which revised the minimum ebitda covenants  among other things 
in addition to the credit facilities  the company executed two unsecured promissory notes to related parties during fiscal a million note was issued to the company s principal stockholder and chairman of the board of directors  with a maturity date of august   and bearing interest at the us index rate calculated under the credit facilities  plus seven percent
