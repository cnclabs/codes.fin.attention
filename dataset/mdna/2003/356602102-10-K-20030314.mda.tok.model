item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes 
overview freemarkets provides software  services and information to help companies improve their sourcing and supply management processes and enhance the capabilities of their supply management organization 
our customers are buyers of industrial parts  raw materials  commodities and services 
we serve our customers from locations in countries on five continents 
our team members provide service to customers in more than languages through operations centers in pittsburgh  brussels and singapore 
since our inception  freemarkets has provided software and services to help companies identify savings  enhance their sourcing efficiency and achieve their strategic sourcing goals by enabling them to source goods and services in our online markets 
in providing these services we work with our customers to identify and screen suppliers and to assemble a request for quotation that provides detailed  clear and consistent information for suppliers to use in our online markets 
our web based technology enables suppliers from around the world to submit bids for a customers purchase orders in real time interactive competition featuring downward price dynamic bidding 
while we have provided this technology enhanced service to buyers since  we began to describe it using the fullsource name in in  we also introduced our qs solution  which enables customers to conduct their own sourcing projects  including running their own online markets 
during the second half of  we introduced a number of new product offerings to expand our solutions beyond sourcing to address a broader set of supply management activities 
our development of a broader set of solutions in is part of a strategic transition from a company that offers a single technology enhanced service to one with multiple software and service solutions 
these activities include supply analysis and strategy  spend requirements management  sourcing  supplier development and supplier relationship management 
we refer to these activities as global supply management  or gsm 
our solutions combine software  services and information to address the gsm market 
these solutions are ultimately designed to help companies lower costs and reduce their supply risks 
critical accounting policies the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and all available information 
however  future events are subject to change  and the best estimates and judgments routinely require adjustment 
us gaap requires us to make estimates and judgments in several areas  including those related to recording various accruals such as incentive compensation and restructuring costs  income taxes  the useful lives of long lived assets such as property and equipment and potential losses from contingencies and litigation 
we believe the policies discussed below are the most critical to our financial statements because they are affected significantly by management s judgments  assumptions and estimates 
revenue recognition as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we generate revenues under service and access agreements with our customers 
while the vast majority of our agreements contain standard business terms and conditions  there are many agreements that contain complex terms and conditions 
as a result  we are required to evaluate the scope and significance of contract provisions in order to determine the appropriate accounting 
in addition  our revenue recognition policy requires an assessment as to whether the collectibility is probable  which inherently requires us to evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers 
our fullsource service agreements typically provide revenues from fixed monthly fees  and may also include performance incentive payments based on volume and or savings 
the structure in a particular service agreement may vary  depending upon the needs of our customer and the conventional practices in the supply market where our customer obtains its materials  commodities or services 
the fees that we receive are for the use of our technology  supplier and supply market information  sourcing operations staff and facilities 
negotiated fees vary by customer  and reflect both the anticipated volume and the staffing  expertise and technology we anticipate committing to complete the services requested by our customers 
we recognize revenues from our fixed monthly fullsource fees ratably as we provide access to our services over the related contract period 
our agreements range in length from a few months to as many as five years 
at any given time  we have agreements of varying lengths with staggered expirations 
some of our agreements permit early termination without cause by our customers without penalty 
many of the service agreements for our fullsource offering include performance incentive payments that are contingent upon our customer achieving specific volumes and or savings  as set forth in the respective agreements 
we recognize these revenues as the thresholds are achieved 
if our fullsource market volume grows  the revenues attributable to these incentive payments may also grow in terms of absolute dollars  but not necessarily as a percentage of revenues 
the agreements for our qs offering provide for revenues from fixed monthly access fees 
the fees that we receive are for providing access to our technology and for add on services 
negotiated access fees for our qs offering vary by customer  and reflect the anticipated number of customer users and add on services 
we recognize revenues from our qs offering as we provide access or add on services 
the agreements for our new offerings  such as es  spend visibility and savings implementation provide for revenues from fixed monthly access fees 
the fees that we receive are for providing access to our technology and for certain services 
we recognize revenues from these new offerings as we provide access or services 
reimbursements  including those related to travel and other out of pocket expenses  are included in revenues  and an equivalent amount of reimbursable expenses are included in cost of revenues 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in cases where we are aware of circumstances that may impair a specific customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  we record a specific allowance against amounts due to us 
for all customers  we recognize allowance for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the receivables are past due  the current business environment and our historical experience 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates or if the economic conditions worsen  additional allowances may be required in the future 
goodwill as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets on january  this standard requires that goodwill no longer be amortized  and instead  be tested for impairment on a periodic basis 
in connection with adopting this standard  we completed step one of the test for impairment  which indicated that the carrying value of surplus record exceeded its estimated fair value  as determined utilizing various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow and comparative market analysis 
thereafter  given the indication of a potential impairment  we completed step two of the test 
based on that analysis  a transitional impairment loss of million was recognized in as a cumulative effect of an accounting change 
at december   we had million in goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet related to surplus record 
in accordance with sfas no 
 it is our policy to assess the potential impairment of goodwill on an annual basis or earlier as circumstances dictate 
stock compensation as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation gives companies the option to adopt the fair value method for expense recognition of employee stock options or to continue to account for employee stock options using the intrinsic value method  as outlined under accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
we have elected to continue to apply the intrinsic value method to account for employee stock options and disclose the pro forma effect as if the fair value method had been applied in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
determination of fullsource market volume and achievable savings revenues from our fullsource offering represented and of our revenues and revenues and fees  respectively  in therefore  we believe that one indicator of our market acceptance is the dollar volume of materials  commodities and services for which we create markets on behalf of our customers as part of our fullsource offering 
we measure this market volume by multiplying the lowest bid price per unit in each market by the estimated number of units that our customer expects to purchase 
when our customers specify multi year purchases in a request for quotation  we calculate volume for the estimated term 
we do not report qs volume since this is a hosted application that enables customers to create and run their own markets  and as a result  we do not believe that volume from these markets can be adequately validated 
fullsource market volume does not necessarily correlate with either our revenues or our operating results in any particular period due to the seasonality of our customers purchasing needs  the timing of the addition of new customers and the length of our customer contracts 
we anticipate that the continued introduction of new products will further reduce the correlation of fullsource volume and revenues in any particular period 
fullsource volume has varied in the past  and we expect it to vary in the future 
the following table sets forth our fullsource market volume for the periods indicated year ended december  in millions fullsource market volume     we believe that the savings identified by customers through our fullsource markets is an indicator of the effectiveness of our fullsource offering 
to estimate these savings  we compare the last price paid by our customer for the items in our markets against the lowest bid price for those items 
actual savings that our customers achieve may not equal these estimates because our customer may not select the lowest bid price  the parties may agree to change price terms after our market or our customer may not actually buy all or any of the items for which bids have been received in our markets 
many of our agreements with customers provide for incentive compensation based on fullsource volume and or savings 
these agreements may calculate market volume or savings differently than the methods we use to calculate market volume and savings for the purposes described above 
treatment of visteon fees in april  we entered into a five year agreement with visteon that provides for fixed monthly fees in return for our fullsource software and services 
we exclude from revenues the amounts that we earn under this contract  however  cost of revenues includes the costs we incur in serving visteon 
at the time we executed this service contract  we granted a warrant for million shares to visteon with an exercise price of 
per share  and we continue to receive ongoing marketing and public relations benefits as a result of our relationship with visteon 
the warrant was valued at million using the black scholes pricing model at the date of the grant in april as a result of a review by the sec  we exclude from our revenues the fees we earn from this contract  and we allocate those fees as payment for the warrant 
however  we view our relationship with visteon as a customer relationship  and for all business and operational purposes in which revenue is a factor in the decision  including budgets  forecasts  allocation of resources  sales compensation  bonus decisions and other performance indicators such as dso  we treat the fees we earn from this contract in the same manner as revenues from other customers 
accordingly  we have referred  where applicable  to revenues and fees throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in order to accurately describe our analysis of our operations 
below is a reconciliation of revenues under generally accepted accounting principles with revenues plus the fees we earn under this service contract with visteon year ended december  in thousands revenues and fees    less fees characterized as payment for warrant    revenues    our relationship with visteon is a standard customer relationship except for the warrant 
we do not expect to recognize revenues under this visteon service contract from the fees we earn during the term of the contract  which expires in  because we have determined  as a result of a review by the sec  that we must allocate those fees as payment for the warrant that we granted to visteon 
results of operations the following table sets forth our consolidated statement of operations data as a percentage of revenues for the periods indicated year ended december  revenues operating costs and expenses cost of revenues  including reimbursements research and development sales and marketing general and administrative stock compensation and warrant costs investment write down restructuring charges and terminated merger related costs goodwill amortization and impairment write off of in process research and development operating loss interest and other income  net loss before taxes and change in accounting provision for income taxes loss before change in accounting cumulative effect of accounting change for goodwill net loss years ended december  and revenues revenues increased from million in to million in as discussed earlier in treatment of visteon fees  we exclude from revenues the fees earned from our contract with visteon  which were million in each of and revenues and fees increased from million in to million in the increase in revenues and fees is primarily attributable to the introduction of our qs offering in early the increased revenues were also attributable to an increased use of our fullsource services by existing customers  as well as the addition of new customers for which we conducted online markets 
the number of customers served  including all of our products and services  increased from in to in as an indicator of our increased services  our fullsource market volume grew from billion in to billion in the following is a breakdown of revenues by product in thousands year ended year ended december  december  of total of total fullsource   all other   total revenues   the following is a breakdown of revenues and fees by product in thousands year ended year ended december  december  of total of total fullsource   all other   total revenues and fees   although customers and fullsource volume increased from to  revenues per customer have decreased over the same period 
this decrease is primarily related to a more diversified international mix of customers  as well as a change in the mix of products and services deployed by our customers 
with the introduction of qs in early  several fullsource only customers have expanded their use of our products to include a broader mix of fullsource  qs and qs services 
as customers gain experience with our sourcing solutions  certain entities have migrated a portion of their sourcing requirements to our self service technologies 
in some cases  increased sales of additional products and services to existing customers have resulted in lower total revenues due to this migration 
we anticipate that our fullsource offering will continue to account for a majority of our revenues and fees in  but the percentage of revenues attributable to fullsource will decrease due to an expected reduction in the utilization of fullsource  as well as increased sales of our new product offerings to current and new customers 
however  we do not believe that sales of new products in will compensate for the reduction in revenue from our fullsource offering  and anticipate that total revenues in will be less than we do expect that the continued introduction of new products and services over the long term will drive customer acquisition  customer share expansion and overall revenue gains 
also included in revenues are reimbursements of million in and million in an equivalent amount of reimbursable expenses is included in cost of revenues 
operating costs and expenses cost of revenues 
cost of revenues decreased from million in to million in as a percentage of revenues  cost of revenues decreased from in to in the decrease in absolute dollar amounts and as a percentage of revenues from to is primarily the result of increased staff productivity as our personnel became more specialized in various sourcing activities  as well as a decrease in incentive compensation in also  we have attained some operating efficiencies from our investments in information tools to automate portions of our sourcing process  as well as organizing our sourcing staff in such a way to take advantage of our domain expertise in various supply markets 
the decrease is also attributable to cost cutting measures in discretionary spending such as travel and recruiting costs  reduced provision for bad debts  primarily due to improvements in days sales outstanding  and reduction in incentive compensation costs 
although our provision for bad debts was lower in  the allowance for doubtful accounts in our consolidated balance sheet increased due to timing of an unusually large write off against the allowance in cost of revenues includes the costs we incur in performing our obligations under the visteon service contract  even though the fees we earn under that contract are excluded from revenues 
we expect our cost of revenues in fiscal year will be lower in absolute dollars  but higher as a percentage of revenues due primarily to a reduction in anticipated revenues 
research and development 
research and development costs increased from million  or of revenues in  to million  or of revenues in the increase was primarily related to a increase in the average number of research and development staff and increased consulting fees to fund ongoing investments in our product development pipeline 
these increases are partially offset by a reduction in incentive compensation costs 
we expect that our research and development costs as a percentage of revenues in fiscal year will be higher than sales and marketing 
sales and marketing costs decreased from million  or of revenues in  to million  or of revenues in the decrease is primarily attributable to cost cutting measures in discretionary spending such as marketing and advertising  recruiting and relocation costs 
the decrease is also attributable to a slight decrease in the average number of sales and marketing staff 
we expect that our sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenues in fiscal year will be relatively consistent with general and administrative 
general and administrative costs decreased from million  or of revenues in  to million  or of revenues in the decrease is primarily attributed to an decrease in the average number of personnel in the areas of human resources  finance and facilities management in compared to the decrease is also attributable to reduced tax consulting costs associated with our international expansion in and  reduced legal costs incurred in connection with the class action lawsuits filed against the company in  cost cutting measures in discretionary spending such as travel  recruiting and relocation costs  and reduced incentive compensation costs 
we expect that our general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues in fiscal year will be relatively consistent with stock compensation and warrant costs 
we recorded million of unearned stock compensation related to employee stock options granted in june and july  which is being amortized over a five year period ending june in and   and  respectively  was amortized related to these grants 
in april  we recorded million of unearned warrant costs related to a warrant granted to visteon 
this value was calculated using the black scholes pricing model at the date of grant and is being amortized over a five year period ending april in each of and  million was amortized related to this warrant  with million reflected as a reduction to our revenues reducing the revenues under the visteon service contract to zero and million as stock compensation and warrant costs 
in   of stock compensation was recorded primarily due to modifications of stock options held by former employees 
investment write down 
in q  we recorded a million loss on our investment in adexa based on our review of its financial results and general market conditions 
in q  we recorded an additional  loss on our investment in adexa based on a valuation determined by financing completed by adexa in july we concluded after each of these reviews that there was an other than temporary decline in the value of our investment in adexa 
as of december   the remaining carrying value of our original million investment in adexa was  restructuring charges and terminated merger related costs 
in  we recorded a million restructuring charge covering the severance and facility closing costs related to our austin office  as well as severance costs associated with other employees who were terminated 
in february  we signed a merger agreement to acquire adexa 
in june  the parties mutually agreed to terminate their proposed merger without payment of any termination fees 
we incurred merger related costs of approximately million related to financial advisor and other professional fees  which were all expensed in in  we re evaluated our office space in one of our foreign offices and reduced our future required payment for employee severance and termination benefit costs 
as a result of these reviews  we reduced the restructuring reserve by  goodwill amortization and impairment 
in connection with our acquisitions of imark and surplus record in march  we recorded goodwill of million  of which million was amortized in in q  we re evaluated our product and technology strategy and determined that we would no longer use the technology platform or the market strategy that we acquired with imark 
as a result of this determination and the closing of our austin facility  we recorded a million impairment charge in q in q  we adopted sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and no longer record goodwill amortization 
interest and other income  net interest and other income  net was million in and million in the increase was primarily attributable to increased average cash and marketable investment balances  partially offset by a reduced weighted average rate of return due to general market conditions 
in  we earned million at a weighted average rate of return of  compared to million at a rate of return of in interest and other income in was partially offset by asset write offs of  provision for income taxes provision for income taxes was  in and  in the decrease is primarily attributable to reduced foreign income taxes in compared to cumulative effect of accounting change for goodwill in q  in connection with the implementation of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we tested goodwill related to surplus record for impairment  and based on estimated future cash flows  recorded an impairment charge of million

years ended december  and revenues revenues increased from million in to million in revenues in and exclude fees of million and million  respectively  from our contract with visteon 
revenues and fees increased from million in to million in the increase in revenues and fees is primarily attributable to the addition of new customers for which we conducted online markets  as well as increased use of our fullsource offering by existing customers 
the number of customers served increased from in to in additionally  our fullsource market volume grew from billion in to billion in to a lesser extent  the increased revenues were also attributable to the introduction of our qs offering

the decrease in cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues from to is primarily the result of increased staff productivity as our personnel became more specialized in various sourcing activities 
also  we have attained operating efficiencies from our investments in information tools to automate portions of our sourcing process  as well as organizing our sourcing staff in such a way to take advantage of our domain expertise in various supply markets 
research and development 
research and development costs increased from million  or of revenues in  to million  or of revenues in the increase in absolute dollars was primarily related to additional development efforts in the first half of this period of time reflected an increase in the number of research and development staff and associated costs for the development of our qs software application  which was released in february  and the continued development of our bidware software and other web based technology  which is designed to further improve staff productivity 
during the second half of  our research and development costs were lower than the corresponding period of due to a decrease in the number of outsourced consulting staff and associated costs as a result of the restructuring in q sales and marketing 
sales and marketing costs increased from million  or of revenues in  to million  or of revenues in the increase in absolute dollars reflects an increase in average sales and marketing staff  slightly offset by a decrease in marketing and trade show costs 
general and administrative 
general and administrative costs decreased from million  or of revenues in  to million  or of revenues in the decrease was primarily related to less personnel in the areas of human resources  finance and facilities management in the second half of  as well as the net effect of reducing the cost of our satellite locations 
during the first half of  our general and administrative costs were higher than the corresponding period of  and related primarily to the expansion of our office infrastructure

in connection with our acquisition of imark in march  we recorded a one time write off of in process research and development of million

net cash from operating activities in  and does not reflect million  million and million  respectively  received under our service contract with visteon 
net cash used in investing activities totaled million in and million in  while net cash provided by investing activities totaled million in during  we spent approximately million to furnish our new facility in pittsburgh  pa and purchase computing and telecommunications equipment to accommodate our increase in personnel 
the increase in capital expenditures in was also attributable to the build out of our international facilities 
we also used million related primarily to our acquisition of surplus record that closed in march in and  we incurred million and million  respectively  of capital expenditures primarily related to our continued expansion of information technology hardware  and to a lesser extent certain office space improvements 
in june  we also invested million in adexa concurrently with the termination of our merger agreement that had been signed in february net cash used in investing activities in is primarily due to the investment of funds in the normal course of our treasury management activities  which includes the movement of funds in and out of cash and cash equivalents and marketable investments to maximize our rate of return 
the net cash outflow from treasury activities in and was million and million  respectively  while our net cash inflow from this activity was million in as a result of the significant investments we have made in our operations  infrastructure and personnel  we expect capital expenditures will be relatively flat in future periods 
net cash provided by financing activities totaled million in  million in and million in the positive financing cash flows in all years primarily reflect the net proceeds from the issuance of stock including issuance of stock under the employee stock purchase plan  the exercise of stock options and an equity investment of million by mitsubishi corporation in 
cash provided by financing activities in  and includes million  million and million  respectively  received under our service contract with visteon 
we have determined  based on a review by the sec in that we are required to classify these receipts as payment for the warrant that we granted to visteon in april prior to november  we had in place a million bank facility  consisting of a million revolving line of credit and two equipment loans originally totaling million 
in november  we entered into a one year revolving credit facility with a maximum principal amount of million 
in october  we amended our bank credit facility to consist of a revolving credit facility with a maximum principal amount of million and a million term loan to be paid in monthly installments  million of which was used to retire borrowings under the old revolving credit facility 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility and the term loan bear interest at the lender s prime rate and prime rate  respectively 
in october and december  we entered into a fourth and fifth amendment  respectively  which extended the expiration date of the revolving credit facility through december and february  respectively 
in february  we entered into the sixth amendment  which reduces the availability under the revolving credit facility from million to million and extends the maturity date through february as of december   million was outstanding under the term loan and the interest rate was 
at december   million was available under the revolving credit facility based on eligible accounts receivable 
our current bank credit facility contains restrictive covenants  including a limitation on incurring additional indebtedness and paying dividends 
our bank credit facility also includes financial covenants as to maximum capital expenditures  minimum tangible net worth  minimum earnings and minimum quick ratio 
we have pledged substantially all of our tangible assets as collateral for the current credit facility 
as of december   we are in compliance with all covenants 
we will continue to invest in the growth of our business 
in q and q  we anticipate negative net cash flows as a result of the timing of our annual incentive based compensation payments and operational losses in the first half of  with positive net cash flows in the second half of we believe that our current resources will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next to months 
we may decide to use cash resources to fund acquisitions of complementary businesses and technologies and  if we do so  we may experience negative cash flows 
our allocation between cash and cash equivalents and marketable investments reflects our anticipated cash flow requirements in the future and current market interest rates 
as of december   our marketable investment allocation represents of total cash and investments  compared to at december  if we are unable to continue to control costs  our resources may be depleted more quickly than we currently anticipate 
in the event that additional financing is required  we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
in january  the board of directors authorized the purchase of up to of our outstanding common stock from time to time on the open market or in one or more negotiated transactions 
as of february   we had purchased  shares at a weighted average stock price of 
our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  are as follows in thousands payment due by period contractual cash obligations total less than year years years after years long term debt  including current portion    operating leases      total contractual cash obligations      total amount of commitment expiration per period amounts other commercial commitments committed less than year years years over years standby letters of credit income taxes the provision for income taxes consisted of foreign taxes of   and  in  and  respectively 
there has been no provision for us federal or state income taxes as we have incurred a net taxable loss in each of these periods 
we recorded foreign income tax provisions relating to taxes withheld from customer payments and remitted to foreign taxing jurisdictions on our behalf  as well as income taxes generated in certain foreign jurisdictions 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately million that will expire beginning in years and  respectively 
in addition  we had federal tax credit carryforwards of approximately million  which expire beginning in utilization of our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations imposed by internal revenue code section and similar state provisions 
such an annual limitation could result in the expiration of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before utilization 
earnings per share under the provisions of sfas no 
 earnings per share  basic earnings per share is computed by dividing the net loss income for the period by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period 
diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing the net loss income for the period by the weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the period 
potentially diluted common shares are comprised of the weighted average outstanding stock options and warrants during each respective period  as determined by the treasury stock method 
in   and  potentially dilutive common shares of million  million and million  respectively  were excluded from earnings per share because of our net loss position 
recently adopted accounting pronouncements we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on january   and no longer record goodwill amortization 
in connection with adopting this standard  we recognized in a transitional impairment loss of million as a cumulative effect of an accounting change 
in march  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
eitf  income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred 
eitf establishes that reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses should be characterized as revenue in the income statement 
we adopted the guidance effective january  prior to  we recorded out of pocket expense reimbursements as a contra to operating expenses  with no effect on net income 
beginning in  we recorded these reimbursements as revenue  and an equivalent amount is included in cost of revenues 
comparative financial statements for prior year information have been reclassified to conform to the new presentation 
in january  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
additionally  sfas no 
amends the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosure about the effects on reported net income of a company s accounting policy decisions with respect to stock based employee compensation 
sfas no 
also amends apb opinion no 
 interim financial reporting to require disclosure about the effects on reported net income in interim financial information 
sfas no 
was effective for fiscal years ending after december  we adopted the disclosure requirements of this standard effective december  recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which addresses accounting for restructuring and similar costs 
sfas no 
supersedes previous accounting guidance  primarily eitf no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
application of sfas no 
is required for restructuring activities initiated after december  sfas no 
requires recognition of the liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity when the liability is incurred 
under issue no 
 a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of a company s commitment to an exit plan 
sfas no 
also establishes that the liability should initially be measured and recorded at fair value 
we expect the adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin clarifies the requirements of fasb statement no 
 accounting for contingencies  relating to a guarantor s accounting for  and disclosure of  the issuance of certain types of guarantees 
fin requires that upon issuance of a guarantee  the guarantor must recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk most of our revenues recognized to date have been denominated in united states dollars and are primarily from customers headquartered in the united states 
we have several locations in europe  asia  australia and south america 
in the future  a larger portion of the revenues we derive from international operations may be denominated in foreign currencies 
we incur costs for our overseas offices in the local currency of those offices for staffing  rent  telecommunications and other services 
as a result  our operating results are subject to fluctuations based upon changes in the exchange rates of those currencies in relation to the united states dollar 
furthermore  to the extent that we engage in international sales denominated in united states dollars  an increase in the value of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our services less competitive in international markets 
we believe that a significant risk related to foreign currency is cash flow risk 
the majority of our foreign currency denominated cash flows relate to funding the operations of our belgian and singapore subsidiaries  and those currencies relative to the united states dollar did not materially fluctuate during however  the euro has strengthened by more than versus the us dollar over the last three months 
if this trend continues  we may experience foreign currency risk that could impact our earnings as our initial plan did not contemplate such continued strength 
we have and will continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations  and when appropriate  we will continue to use financial hedging techniques to minimize the effect of these fluctuations in the future

interest rate risk our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of united states interest rates  particularly because most of our investments are in short term instruments 
at december   our cash and marketable investments were million and our average rate of return was 
a hypothetical change in this average rate would increase or decrease our investment income by approximately  based on the current market environment  we anticipate our rate of return in to approximate to 
borrowings under our existing revolving credit facility and term loan are also interest rate sensitive  because the applicable rate varies with changes in the prime rate of lending 
we had million and million of debt outstanding at december  and  respectively 
average effective interest rates were in and in a hypothetical change of in our effective interest rate from year end levels would increase or decrease interest expense by approximately  we cannot assure you that interest rate fluctuations will not harm our business in the future
