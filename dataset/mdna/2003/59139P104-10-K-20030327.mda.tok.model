item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading global provider of operations support systems oss software solutions that help communications providers manage their networks and services 
our products automate key communications management processes  from network planning and engineering to operations and customer care 
our products enable communications providers to increase revenue and reduce costs through more efficient management of network resources  quick deployment of communication services  and delivery of superior customer service 
we derive substantially all of our revenue from the sale of software licenses  related professional services  and support of our software to communications services providers 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
estimates are used for  but not limited to  the accounting for the allowance for doubtful accounts  contingencies  restructuring costs  realizability of tax assets  and other special charges 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the reported financial results are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements 
our software licensing and professional services agreements with customers typically have terms and conditions that are described in signed orders and a master agreement with each customer 
our sales for a given period typically involve large financial commitments from a relatively small number of customers 
accordingly  delays in the completion of sales during a quarter may negatively impact revenues in that quarter 
consistent with industry practice  we sometimes agree to bill our license fees in more than one installment over extended periods 
when installments extend beyond six months  amounts not due immediately are deferred and recorded as revenue when payments are due  assuming all revenue recognition criteria have been met 
we generally recognize license revenues when our customer has signed a license agreement  we have delivered the software product  product acceptance is not subject to express conditions  the fees are fixed or determinable and we consider collection to be probable 
we allocate the agreed fees for multiple products and services licensed or sold in a single transaction among the products and services using the residual method as required by sop  deferring the fair value of the undelivered elements and recognizing the residual amount of the fees as revenue upon delivery of the software license 
on occasion we may enter into a license agreement with a customer requiring development of additional software functions or services necessary for the software s performance of specified functions 
for those agreements  we recognize revenue for the entire arrangement on a percentage of completion basis as the development services are provided 
we generally recognize service revenues as the services are performed 
we recognize revenues from maintenance agreements ratably over the maintenance period  usually one year 
our software products are priced to meet the needs of our target market segments  which include large facility based incumbent service providers and wireless and ip service providers 
we charge a base price for core products  coupled with additional license fees for add on modules 
in addition  we typically scale our license pricing based on the extent of our customers usage as measured by the number of users of our product  the number of our customers subscribers  or the size of the network our product helps manage 
we sell additional license capacity for our products when our customers usage of our product exceeds earlier license limits 
annual maintenance and support contracts are priced as a percentage of the license fee for the product being maintained 
for a new customer  our initial sale of licenses and associated services  including maintenance and support  generally ranges from several hundred thousand to several million dollars 
service revenues consist principally of software implementations  upgrades and configurations  and customer training  as well as software maintenance agreements that include both customer support and the right 
table of contents to product updates 
we use our own employees and subcontract with system integrator partners to provide consulting services to our customers 
the majority of our services are priced on an hourly basis 
we also offer fixed price consulting packages  primarily for repeatable solutions 
since we implement some of our services on a fixed fee basis  if we incur more costs than we expect in implementations  our profitability will suffer 
our process for tracking progress to completion on such arrangements is through individual detailed project plans and the regular review of labor hours incurred compared to estimated hours to complete the project 
when estimates of costs to complete the project indicate that a loss will be incurred  these losses are recognized immediately 
any estimation process  including that which is used in preparing contract accounting models  involves inherent risk 
to the extent that our estimates of revenues and expenses on these contracts change periodically in the normal course of business  due to the modifications of our contractual arrangements or changes in cost  such changes would be reflected in the results of operations as a change in accounting estimates in the period the revisions are determined 
we normally ship our software and perform services shortly after we receive orders 
as a result  our quarterly financial results are largely dependent on orders received during that period 
we recognize revenue only in cases where we believe collection is probable 
in situations where collection is doubtful or when we have indications that a customer is facing financial difficulty  we recognize revenue as cash payments are received 
in addition  for customers not on the cash basis of accounting  we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon the expected collectibility of accounts receivable 
we regularly review the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts through identification of specific receivables where it is expected that payment will not be received in addition to establishing a general reserve policy that is applied to all amounts that are not specifically identified 
if there is a deterioration of a major customer s credit worthiness or actual defaults are higher than our historical experience  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due us could be adversely affected 
the allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of the ultimate recovery of accounts receivable as of the reporting date 
changes may occur in the future that may cause us to reassess the collectibility of amounts and at which time we may need to reduce or provide additional allowances in excess of that currently provided 
we assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets by projecting whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the foreseeable future 
accordingly  we carry a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  which are related primarily to net deductible temporary difference  tax credit carryforwards and net operating loss carryforwards 
we evaluate a variety of factors in determining the amount of the deferred income tax assets to be recognized pursuant to sfas no  accounting for income taxes  including our earnings history  the number of years our operating loss and tax credits can be carried forward  the existence of taxable temporary differences  near term earnings expectation  and the highly competitive nature of the telecommunications industry and its potential impact on our business 
as a result of these analyses  a million valuation allowance was established during the year ended december  we evaluate our long lived assets  including acquired intangibles  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of any assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of any asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 

table of contents pro forma financial results we report quarterly unaudited financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
we also report pro forma financial information in earnings releases and investor conference calls 
this pro forma financial information excludes certain non cash and special charges  consisting primarily of the amortization and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets  and restructuring costs 
we believe the disclosure of the pro forma financial information helps investors evaluate the results of our ongoing operations 
however  we urge investors to carefully review the generally accepted accounting principles financial information included as part of our quarterly reports on form q and our annual reports on form k 
acquisitions oss software assets from nortel networks 
in february  we acquired certain oss assets from nortel networks 
with this acquisition  we extended our product portfolio by adding a leading carrier class service activation product and several point solutions that allow communications service providers to efficiently manage and deliver differentiated services for internet protocol ip  data  and wireless communications 
as a result of the acquisition  we now offer a more comprehensive suite of oss solutions for wireless  ip  data  and traditional networks and services 
the acquisition also strengthens the worldwide scope of our product sales and services through an established presence in europe 
we acquired these assets for million in cash and the assumption of certain liabilities 
our financial results include revenues and costs of the acquired business effective february lat information systems inc in july  we acquired all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of montreal based lat information systems inc  a developer of geospatial software for planning  design and management of communications networks 
our acquisition of lat information systems inc allowed us to use graphical geospatial geographic technology to expand a service provider s capabilities in network planning and engineering functions and extends the metasolv solution functionality to include support for market demand forecasting  network planning and design  service fulfillment  and executive decision support 
we offered this product under the brand  metasolv network and service planning  both as a separate product and integrated with the metasolv solution 
the aggregate purchase price was approximately million consisting of million in cash and  exchangeable shares of metasolv canada holdings inc  which were exchangeable for our shares on a one to one basis 
in the third quarter of  we decided to cease providing enhancements to the metasolv network and service planning product 
orchestream 
in december  we announced an offer to acquire all of the ordinary shares of london based orchestream holdings plc  a recognized leader in ip service activation software solutions for wire line and mobile carriers 
the orchestream acquisition adds a robust ip service activation product to our portfolio  and strong sales and technology partnerships in europe 
under the terms of the offer  metasolv will pay pounds sterling per share  valuing orchestream at approximately million pounds  or million us dollars based on december exchange rates 
this acquisition became effective in february  and is not included in our operating results for results of operations the year was a difficult time to sell software to the communications industry 
capital spending and the financial condition of many service providers remained depressed  and this is reflected in our financial results 
as it became clear that our revenues would fall short of our expectations  we implemented several initiatives during that we believe position us for long term growth 
these actions included completion of the acquisition of oss software assets from nortel 
this investment extended the breadth of our product offerings into service activation  billings mediation and other oss applications  as well as adding robust and configurable service ordering and provisioning management solutions to our product portfolio 

table of contents provided us with an established international customer base  as well as sales and services operations in europe 
this was key to our achieving of revenue from outside the us in  up from in increased our penetration at large communications service providers  such that we now report approximately of the world s top communications providers as our customers  expanded our sales to the rapidly growing wireless mobility segment  reaching of our total revenue in and improving our long term growth opportunities 
closed facilities in chicago  montreal and belgium  and consolidated facilities in plano and denver 
we also eliminated approximately staff positions during the year 
these actions reduced our ongoing cost structure by approximately million  annually  and more closely matched our current expense levels with existing revenue opportunities 
initiated the acquisition of orchestream  which will further strengthen our business in europe and for ip activation worldwide 
we believe our actions in provide a strong foundation for future revenue growth and a return to profitability 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of total revenues represented by certain line items in our statements of operations 
year ended december  revenues license service total revenues cost of revenues license amortization and impairment of intangible assets service total cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative restructuring costs in process research and development total operating expenses income loss from operations interest and other income  net loss on investments income loss before taxes income tax expense benefit net income loss 
table of contents compared to revenues total revenues decreased to million in the year ended december   from million in the decrease in revenue between these periods resulted from a decline in license sales  partially offset by increase in service revenue 
license fees 
license fee revenues in declined to million  from million in the decline in license revenue resulted primarily from fewer sales to new customers and fewer follow on sales of capacity licenses and add on functionality to existing customers 
additionally  our average contract prices in have declined compared to prior years  due to smaller implementations  and competitive pricing pressures 
we believe the decline in license revenues results from the protracted downturn in the telecommunications industry  and related decreases in capital expenditures by service providers 
we expect these weak market conditions to continue in the near term 
however  we believe our extensive product portfolio positions us well to initiate deployments at new customers and extend deployments at existing customers with new products and product capacity extensions  resulting in future license revenues 
services 
revenues from services increased to million in from million in  primarily due to consulting and maintenance service revenues attributable to our recently acquired products 
consulting and education service revenues increased to million in  from million in the increase in consulting and education revenues resulted from fewer  but larger  services engagements 
the larger project size reflects the scope of engagements primarily at larger customers  while the lower number of overall projects reflects fewer new customer implementations 
we are marketing longer services engagements to key customers to help them use our products most efficiently  and we expect these longer engagements to provide more stability in our consulting revenues 
post contract customer support  or maintenance revenues  increased to million in  from million in the increase in maintenance revenue was primarily due to the inclusion of customer support for our newly acquired products  partially offset by a decline in metasolv solution maintenance revenue compared to the year ago period 
the decline in same product maintenance revenue resulted primarily from financial difficulties at some of our smaller customers 
the newly acquired products represented approximately of our total maintenance revenue in the most recent fiscal year 
in we adopted a fasb staff position regarding the income statement classification of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred 
for comparison purposes  service revenues and costs for and in this report have been restated to include our expenses that are reimbursed by our customers 
our reimbursable expenses during  and increased services revenue and cost of revenue by million  million and million  respectively 
there was no change in reported profits as a result of this change 
concentration of revenues 
as of december   our active customer list includes more than communications service providers worldwide  including approximately of the world s largest providers 
during  our top ten customers represented of our total revenue with one customer accounting for of revenue and no other single customer accounting for more than of our revenue 
in any given year we generally derive a significant portion of our revenue from a small number of relatively large sales 
a loss or significant decrease in the sale of products and services to any customer from whom we received more than of our total revenue during a recent year is likely to have a material adverse affect on our results of operations and financial condition 
additionally  our inability to consummate one or more substantial sales in any future period could seriously harm our operating results for that period 

table of contents international revenues 
during  we recognized million in revenues from sources outside the united states compared to million in  representing and of revenue in each period  respectively 
the growth in international revenues during was due to our increased penetration into european and asian markets  accelerated by our product acquisitions 
cost of revenues license costs 
license costs consist primarily of royalties for third party software that is embedded in our products 
license costs were million in and million in  representing and of license revenue in each period  respectively 
the decrease in license costs in in absolute dollars is primarily due to the elimination of royalty expense for use of third party e commerce software and to lower license revenue in the increase in license costs as a percent of license revenue in resulted from a single sale in the fourth quarter that included software from a third party 
we plan to continue the use of third party software where it provides an advantage for our customers 
while this plan lowers our overall product development cost  it may increase our cost of license revenue  both in absolute terms and as a percentage of revenues 
amortization and impairment of intangible assets 
the value assigned to intangible assets  primarily technology rights  is amortized over the estimated useful life of the assets using the greater of straight line or the ratio that current gross revenues related to those assets bears to the total current and anticipated future gross revenues related to those assets 
the estimated useful life of these assets range from nine months to thirty six months 
in  cost of revenues included million amortization of intangible assets acquired from both nortel networks and lat information systems inc  and a million charge for impairment of our intangible assets 
this compares to a million amortization of intangible assets in the increase in amortization expense in was due to the purchase of developed oss software technology rights and contracts from nortel networks in february of in the third quarter of  we performed an impairment test on our intangible assets and as a result reduced the value of these assets and recorded a non cash charge of million 
the revaluation of intangible assets consisted of a reduction in the value of technology rights acquired in each of the acquisitions 
service costs 
service costs consist of expenses to provide consulting  training and maintenance services 
these costs include compensation and related expenses for employees  and fees for third party consultants who provide services for our customers under subcontractor arrangements 
service costs were million in  up from million in  representing and of service revenues in each period  respectively 
the increase in service costs in the most recent year resulted primarily from additional customer support for our newly acquired products and customers 
the increase in service costs as a percentage of service revenues was primarily due to a higher level of software engineering effort for specific customers 
we record engineering effort that is specific to a customer contract as a cost of revenue  whereas engineering effort towards general product releases is normally recorded as development expense 
we expect this higher level of customer specific engineering to continue in future periods as we work to adapt our software to provide customers with competitive advantages in their unique operating environments 
operating expenses research and development expenses 
research and development expenses consist primarily of costs related to our staff of software developers  contracted development costs and the associated infrastructure costs required to support product development 
during  research and development expenses increased to 
table of contents million from million in  representing and of total revenues in each period  respectively 
the year to year increase in research and development expense was primarily due to increased personnel costs related to the february acquisition of new products  and was partially offset by lower contracted development expenses 
research and development expenses increased as a percentage of revenues between these periods due to the increased personnel costs  coupled with the decline in revenues 
during  our research and development investments were focused on new products and enhancements to address next generation communications networks  including wireless mobility technologies and user group defined product enhancements 
specific enhancements include improved integration between our existing products and with major crm  billing  and service assurance systems  so that communications providers can more quickly realize business efficiencies using metasolv products 
we are also developing products and enhancements to address the needs of our customers  including network inventory and billing reconciliation  and extending functionality for ip and wireless management 
we expect to continue a relatively large future investment in product development as we further enhance our integrated  modular suite of products to address emerging communications technologies 
the modular structure of our products allows communications service providers to implement product functionality in phases  depending on their needs  to realize near term value and to maximize opportunities for longer term benefits from an integrated oss system 
our product development methodology generally establishes technological feasibility near the end of the development process  when we have a working model 
costs incurred after the development of a working model and prior to product release are insignificant 
accordingly  we have not capitalized any software development costs 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions  travel  trade shows and other related expenses required to sell our software 
in  sales and marketing expenses increased to million from million in  representing and of revenue in each period  respectively 
major changes in sales and marketing expenses between these two periods include a reduction in commission expense related to lower revenues  partially offset by a staff increase related to marketing and selling support for our new products and a strengthened sales force in europe and south america 
we expect that our sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase  particularly due to the integration of our sales and marketing teams with those from our recent acquisition  and as we increase our presence in europe and latin america 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist of costs for finance and accounting  legal  human resources  information systems  facilities  bad debt expense  and corporate management not directly allocated to other departments 
general and administrative expenses in decreased to million  compared to million in  representing and of revenues in each period  respectively 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a reduction in bad debt expense 
staffing in general and administrative functions remained relatively unchanged between the periods 
restructuring and other costs 
restructuring and other costs during totaled million  comprised of approximately related to a reduction in force of approximately positions  million for facilities consolidations and lease commitments for space being vacated  and in asset write offs and other restructuring expenses  partially offset by a million nonrecurring adjustment to accrued royalties 
the remaining severance payments of million will be paid out by year end  and the million of lease payments will be paid out through year 
table of contents we expect these restructuring actions to yield approximately million in annual cost savings 
we will continue to align costs with expectations for future revenues and market conditions  and may take future restructuring actions to better position our company for profitable growth 
in  we recorded a pre tax restructuring charge of million that consisted of million for a reduction in force of approximately people  and approximately million for lease commitments for certain field offices being closed and related fixed asset write downs 
the restructuring was in response to lower software license bookings and the expectation of lower revenues in the second half of in process research and development 
in connection with our acquisition of certain oss assets from nortel networks  we recorded a pre tax charge of million for acquired in process research and development ipr d during the first quarter of at the date of the acquisition  the ipr d projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses 
the projects generally included enhancements and upgrades to existing technology  enhanced communication among systems  introduction of new functionality and the development of new technology primarily for integration purposes 
the value of the ipr d was calculated using a discounted cash flow analysis of the anticipated income stream of the related product sales 
the projected net cash flows were computed using discount rates from to for the various ipr d projects 
these projects were essentially completed by year end our financial results in included million of ipr d costs related to our lat acquisition 
goodwill impairment 
we are required to periodically assess the value of goodwill under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
we are one reporting unit  as defined by the standard 
as outlined in the authoritative literature  the assessment of whether goodwill has been impaired is based on the our estimate of the fair value of the reporting unit using a model that considers both a discounted future cash flow analysis and market capitalization data 
during  the market capitalization of our company fell to a level below its book value 
the decline in the market capitalization indicated that a potential impairment in the value of enterprise goodwill existed  therefore  management performed an interim valuation in july this valuation indicated that an impairment of goodwill existed and we recorded a charge of million to eliminate the goodwill 
interest and other income  net in  interest and other income  net  primarily consisting of interest income and interest expense  was million  compared to million in the year ago period 
the decrease in interest and other income was primarily due to the decline in cash and marketable securities balances upon which we receive interest income  and lower interest rates earned on invested balances 
income tax expense benefit we recorded an income tax benefit of million in and income tax expense of million in as a percentage of the loss before taxes  our income tax benefit was in compared to income tax expense of in the difference between our effective income tax benefit and the statutory rate in was due to state and local tax benefits  in process research and development write offs that were not deductible for tax purposes  and the establishment of a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes fas  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
fas provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets if realization 
table of contents of such assets is more likely than not 
the write down of the goodwill and revaluation of intangible assets generated an increase in deferred tax benefits 
based upon the available evidence  which includes our recent operating performance and projections for the future near term performance  we have provided a valuation allowance of approximately million against our net deferred tax assets 
we intend to evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis 
any future changes will be reflected as a component of income tax expense 
the difference between our effective income tax expense and the statutory federal rate in was due principally to in process research and development write offs that were not deductible for tax purposes and state and local income taxes  offset by research and development tax credits 
compared to revenues total revenues in were million  compared to million in  representing a year over year decrease 
the decrease in revenues during was primarily related to fewer sales to new customers and  to a lesser extent  fewer follow on sales to existing customers 
we attributed the lower number of sales to overall lower capital spending in the communications industry 
the sales slowdown adversely affected our license and implementation consulting revenue in  while the impact was partially offset by a increase in maintenance revenues 
license fees 
license fee revenues decreased to million in from million in license revenue in the second half of was below the first half  reflecting fewer sales to new customers  and also lower sales of modules and additional user seats to existing customers  where business contraction and their staff reductions reduced their need for additional near term capacity 
our product pricing remained relatively stable during we contracted with new license customers during  compared to in  not including new customers obtained through acquisition of the lat information systems inc business in july the lower order activity in the latter part of the  as well as the decline in license revenue in  was related to an overall slowdown in communications infrastructure spending by our potential customers 
services 
revenues from services were million in compared to million in  representing a year over year decrease 
the decline in service revenues from to was due to a decline in consulting and education services  partially offset by a increase in maintenance revenue 
consulting and education services revenue was million in and million in the decline in consulting and education services revenue was largely due to fewer new customer implementations related to fewer new license product sales and  to a lesser extent  lower spending by our existing customers on upgrades  product integrations and training of their employees 
our consulting revenue was also adversely affected by the increasing ability of alliance partners to provide consulting services directly to our customers  and license product enhancements and tools that shorten software implementation and upgrade times for our customers 
post contract customer support  or maintenance revenues  increased to million in from million in  representing a year over year increase of 
the increase in maintenance revenue was due to a higher cumulative base of license products that we supported 
the number of customers from whom we recognized maintenance revenue declined between the fourth quarter of and the fourth quarter of  largely due to consolidation among some of our customers and financial failure of others 
the decline in the number of customers was most evident during the first half of  and relatively stable during the second half of the year 
the customer losses tended to be our smaller revenue accounts  while same customer maintenance 
table of contents revenue from our remaining customers in increased over  primarily due to their growth of operations and their follow on purchases of our products 
concentration of revenues 
in  our top ten customers represented of our total revenue  with no one customer accounting for more than of revenue 
international revenues 
we recognized million of revenue during from sources outside the united states  representing of total revenue  up from in cost of revenues license costs 
license costs were million in and million in  representing and of license revenue in each year  respectively 
the increase in license costs  as a percentage of license revenue  was primarily due to royalty expenses for use of third party e commerce software that we embedded in some of our products 
in july we replaced this royalty based agreement with a one time payment for a perpetual license  thus reducing royalty expense as a percentage of license revenue 
amortization and impairment of intangible assets 
for the year ended december   cost of revenues included a million charge for amortization of intangible assets 
this amortization consisted of million of purchased technology rights and million attributable to customer contracts purchased from lat information systems inc the value assigned to intangible assets  primarily technology rights  is amortized over the estimated useful life of the assets using the greater of straight line or the ratio that current gross revenues related to those assets bears to the total current and anticipated future gross revenues related to those assets 
the estimated useful life of these assets ranged from nine months to thirty six months 
service costs 
service costs were million in and million in  representing and of service revenues in each year  respectively 
the decline in service costs was primarily due to lower use of subcontracted consultants related to lower demand for consulting services  partially offset by increased costs for customer support 
the decrease in service cost as a percentage of service revenues was primarily due to the relatively higher proportion of higher margin maintenance revenues  compared to consulting and training revenues 
operating expenses research and development expenses 
product research and development expenses during and were both million  representing and of total revenues in each year  respectively 
while our research and development investment in was equal to our investment in  the investment in reflected an increase in research and development employees and a decline in contracted development spending 
during  our research and development investments were focused on new products and enhancements to address next generation communications networks  new features to address the needs of multinational communications providers and user group defined product enhancements 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses were million in and million in  representing and of revenues in each year  respectively 
sales and marketing expenses increased each year primarily due to the expansion of our sales and marketing staff  increased commission expense  and increased travel costs  coupled with higher expenses related to our expansion into europe and latin america 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues from to was due to the lower revenue in general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million in and million in  representing and of revenues in each year  respectively 
the increase in general and administrative expenses resulted primarily from a higher provision for doubtful accounts which 
table of contents increased to million in from million in  and also due to staff increases in information systems and administrative functions to support the increased scale of our operations 
restructuring and other costs 
in july  we announced a corporate restructuring  and in the third quarter of we recorded a pre tax restructuring charge of million 
this charge consisted of million for a reduction in force of approximately people  and approximately million for lease commitments for certain field offices being closed and related fixed asset write downs 
the restructuring was in response to lower software license bookings and the expectation of lower revenues in the third and fourth quarters of we expected approximately million of annualized savings from this restructuring program 
at december   approximately million was included in accrued liabilities  related primarily to future minimum lease commitments  which expire in in process research and development 
in connection with our acquisition of lat information systems inc  we recorded a pre tax charge of million for acquired in process research and development ipr d in the third quarter of at the date of this acquisition  the ipr d projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses 
the projects generally included enhancements and upgrades to existing technology  enhanced communication among systems  introduction of new functionality and the development of new technology primarily for integration purposes 
the value of the ipr d was calculated using a discounted cash flow analysis of the anticipated income stream of the related product sales 
the projected net cash flows were computed using a discount rate of for the ipr d project 
loss on investments during the third quarter of  we determined that the decline in fair value of two equity investments below their carrying value was other than temporary 
accordingly  we recorded a pre tax charge of million to write down the value of investments  based on an independent appraisal 
interest and other income  net interest and other income net  primarily consisting of interest income and interest expense  was million in and million in the decrease in interest and other income from to was primarily due to lower interest rates earned on invested balances  partially offset by higher cash and marketable security balances during income tax expense income tax expense was million in and million in as a percentage of income before taxes  income tax expense was in and in the increase in the effective tax rate during was due principally to the in process research and development write off that is not deductible for tax purposes 
tax expense as a percentage of pre tax income differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to these nondeductible costs and state taxes  partially offset by estimated tax credits in liquidity and capital resources at december   our primary sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash and marketable securities  totaling million and representing of total assets 
we invested our cash in excess of current operating requirements in short and intermediate term investment grade securities that are available for sale as needed to finance our future growth 
in december we deposited million in escrow for the proposed acquisition of orchestream holdings plc 
this deposit was classified as restricted cash on the balance sheet at december  total cash and marketable securities decreased million during  from a balance of million at the end of this decrease was primarily attributable to the february acquisition million  cash used in operations million  and capital expenditures million 

table of contents cash used in operating activities during was million  compared to million generated from operations during the cash used in is primarily comprised of our million net loss adjusted for the impairment of acquired goodwill and intangible assets of million  and other non cash items  including an increase of million in non cash working capital and a million increase in tax benefits which were partially offset by million in depreciation and amortization expense  and million of purchased in process research and development expense 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  comprised of the net sale of million in marketable securities  partially offset by million in acquisition related cash outflows  million restricted cash related to the february orchestream acquisition  and million in capital expenditures primarily for computing hardware and software and leasehold improvements for our new employees and offices 
we have no unusual capital commitments at december   and our principal commitments consist of obligations under operating leases 
net cash used for investing activities was million in  comprised of million in purchases of marketable securities  million for the lat information systems inc acquisition  and million in capital expenditures for computing hardware and software  furniture  and leasehold improvements 
net cash provided from financing activities during consisted of million in proceeds from our employee stock option programs 
net cash provided from financing activities in was million 
at december   we had outstanding contractual obligations for cumulative lease payments of approximately million through we believe that our cash flows generated by operations  together with current cash and marketable securities balances  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
from time to time  we evaluate potential acquisitions and other strategic relationships with complementary businesses  products and technologies 
should cash balances be insufficient to complete an acquisition or otherwise meet our business objectives  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities 
the decision to sell additional equity or debt securities could be made at any time and could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
new accounting standards in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used and establishes new standards on the recognition of certain identifiable intangible assets separate from goodwill for all business combinations initiated after june  sfas no 
requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized but instead be tested for impairment at least annually 
sfas no 
also requires that intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values 
the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
effective july   and adopted sfas no 
effective january  under sfas no 
 the company is required to perform transitional impairment tests for its goodwill as of the date of adoption 
step one of the transitional goodwill impairment test  which compares the fair values of our reporting units to their respective carrying values  was completed by june   and no impairment was indicated as of january  the company is required to assess the value of goodwill under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
the company is one reporting unit  as defined by the standard 
as outlined in the authoritative literature  the assessment of whether goodwill has been impaired is based on the company s estimate of the fair value of the reporting unit using a model which considers both a discounted future cash flow analysis and market capitalization data
