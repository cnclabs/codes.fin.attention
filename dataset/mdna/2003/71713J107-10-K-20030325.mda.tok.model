part i item business pharmanetics  inc the company or pharmanetics  through its wholly owned subsidiary cardiovascular diagnostics  inc cvdi  develops  manufactures and markets rapid diagnostics to dose  manage and screen patients on drugs affecting coagulation 
the company s products are a proprietary analyzer and dry chemistry tests and controls  known as the thrombolytic assessment system or tas  that provide a physician  at the point of patient care  information that can affect therapy 
pharmanetics is establishing itself in this emerging field of theranostics  defined as rapid near patient testing in which the diagnostic results may influence treatment decisions 
the company s current tests and tests under development are used in the treatment of angina  heart attack  stroke  deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary and arterial emboli 
tas is a stat  or as soon as possible  point of care system capable of monitoring the coagulation formation and lysis dissolution of blood clots 
such monitoring provides information which is critical in administering anticoagulant and thrombolytic clot dissolving drugs  which are used in the treatment of a variety of medical disorders 
hemostatic test results must be provided quickly because a majority of the drugs used to regulate clotting are cleared rapidly from the body  and certain drugs must be closely monitored to maintain drug levels within an effective treatment range 
the company believes that hospital central and stat laboratories  which currently provide the majority of such testing  generally cannot provide timely information to clinicians regarding drugs that affect coagulation and thrombolysis 
delay in providing such information can be a problem because the physician is likely to leave the patient area during this time  which may result in a further delay of diagnosis and treatment 
the company believes that the tas can provide information regarding coagulation and thrombolysis as well as drug monitoring on a timely basis  permitting quicker diagnosis and therapeutic intervention  which will improve therapy and the quality of patient care 
the company believes that this improvement may facilitate quicker transfers out of expensive critical care settings  reduce the overall length of hospital stays  reduce expenditures for laboratory equipment and its associated maintenance  and reduce the unnecessary use of pharmaceuticals 
in addition  point of care testing can reduce hospitals costs by reducing the numerous steps  paperwork and personnel used in collecting  transporting  documenting and processing blood samples 
the company currently sells domestically and internationally its tas analyzer and a menu of tests and controls 
fda approved tests that are currently sold for commercial use are listed and described below under the subheading products 
the company has sold three other tests  the lysis onset time lot  ecarin clotting time ect and a modified ecarin clotting time test for investigational use only which are described below under the subheading tests cards under development 
in addition  the company has obtained a humanitarian device exemption  or hde  for its ect card  which is used in managing patients suffering from heparin induced thrombocytopenia  or hit 
hde approval is an expedited fda authorization process to market devices used in rare disease states where no existing solution is available 
in addition  the company is currently researching and developing other test cards for use on the tas system 
industry overview blood testing within the practice of laboratory medicine has been evolving in response to the introduction of new cardiovascular drugs and the physician s demand for information 
this demand for information is particularly acute in blood testing  where access to timely and accurate results is critical to effective patient care 
initially  hospital blood analysis was performed in multiple small laboratories that typically used time consuming manual techniques 
the advent of automated blood testing allowed for centralization and standardization of laboratory tests 
with improved access to blood analysis  physicians began to use laboratory tests as a primary diagnostic tool and consequently demanded more tests and faster results 
in an effort to meet this demand  some hospitals established decentralized stat laboratories nearer the patient 
these laboratories typically rely on technology designed for efficiency in a high volume centralized department 
the company believes that reliance on this technology makes stat laboratories inadequate and expensive  creating a need for new technology suitable for use at the point of patient care 
as diagnostics move closer to the patient  the centralized lab has had a reduced role in the purchasing decisions for 
table of contents point of care systems 
the physician is more likely to have influence over the use of point of care technology given its ability to be a valuable tool for managing therapy 
access to timely and accurate coagulation test results is important because a majority of the drugs used to regulate clotting are cleared rapidly from the body and these drugs must be closely monitored to maintain drug levels within a safe and effective treatment range 
recent advances in technology allow many blood tests to be performed at the point of patient care  where the physician can most effectively use test results 
while speed is important in point of care testing  accuracy is critical 
because point of care testing is often performed by operators who lack special laboratory skills or training  error proof testing systems are important 
by design  most point of care tests require limited materials and minimum labor 
point of care test systems must also comply with the clinical laboratory improvement act of  or clia  and its regulations 
see government regulation 
technology the tas was designed to perform blood analysis rapidly and accurately at the point of care to provide a solution to these current healthcare demands 
the company s core technology relating to both the tas analyzer and test cards is currently protected by a number of us and corresponding international patents 
the tas card technology combines a mixture of dry reagents and paramagnetic iron oxide particles  or piop  that is contained within the card s reaction chamber 
the test card has the approximate dimensions and half the thickness of a standard credit card 
blood samples are introduced into this reagent particle mixture  dissolving the dry reagent and freeing the magnetic particles to move within the card s chamber 
when the oscillating magnetic field is generated by the tas analyzer  the magnetic particles within the tas card s reaction chamber move in response to the magnetic field 
an optical sensor within the tas analyzer monitors the motion of the magnetic particles without touching the blood sample 
when movement diminishes to a predetermined amplitude  the tas system determines that a clot has been formed 
conversely  the same technology is used to measure the time required for a clot to dissolve 
the company s technology permits the measurement of clot dissolution by introducing a sample of blood to a mixture of magnetic particles and reagents including a clot forming chemical  thereby inducing a clot 
the system then measures the amount of time required for the induced clot to dissolve 
the company believes that tas is the only point of care system capable of monitoring both coagulation and dissolution of clots 
furthermore  an additional benefit to the company is the flexibility of the tas technology  which allows for further expansion of the company s menu of tests  since new tests can be developed by using different reagents in the test cards 
products tas analyzer the tas analyzer weighs approximately four pounds and is about the size of a typical office telephone 
the tas analyzer has a four line lcd display  which is driven by software to prompt the technician to input the user and patient id numbers  sample type  and timing of application of the blood 
the analyzer and test cards are designed to work effectively in a decentralized testing environment where they are used by healthcare personnel who do not need formal central laboratory training 
to operate tas  a test card is passed through the magnetic strip reader of the analyzer  which automatically initiates quality controls and begins to elicit information from the operator through a series of prompts outlining the operating procedure for the specific test to be performed 
the test card is then inserted into the tas analyzer 
a single drop of unprocessed  noncitrated or citrated whole blood or plasma is then placed into the reaction chamber of the test card  which already contains the appropriate mixture of dry reagents and piop for the test being performed 
typically within three minutes  the screen on the tas analyzer displays a numerical test result  which is comparable to the result which would be achieved in a central laboratory using traditional testing procedures 
the portable analyzer has been designed with a memory capability  may be connected to a printer  and with a software upgrade may be connected to the hospital s patient information system 
the internal memory of the tas analyzer allows for the storage of up to  individual test results and has an alphanumeric keypad that allows for the input of up to a character patient identification code 
additionally  the keypad provides for coded entry so only authorized personnel can gain access to the system 
the analyzer can operate either on wall current or on an internal rechargeable battery 
the company s distributor  bayer diagnostics bayer  currently markets this product as the rapidpoint coag analyzer 
accent the accent is a microprocessor based hardware accessory to the tas analyzer 
it connects to the tas analyzer and automatically calculates the information required by physicians to manage the anticoagulation of patients on heparin during 
table of contents cardiopulmonary bypass procedures 
it is used in conjunction with the htt  prt and hmt cards and is marketed by bayer as rapidpoint accent 
the data collected by accent can be transferred to a printer and or hospital information system for storage 
fda cleared test cards the following describes the company s test cards that have been cleared by the fda the enoxaparin test  approved by the fda in august  detects the anticoagulant effect of the low molecular weight heparin lmwh enoxaparin  used for the treatment and prevention of thrombotic diseases 
enoxaparin is the world s top selling lmwh and is marketed by aventis pharmaceuticals under the brand names lovenox and clexane this test was developed in a collaborative development program with aventis 
the test assists physicians in evaluating anticoagulation status rapidly before and during percutaneous coronary intervention pci  and before removing the sheath 
the pt test is a general screening test that is used to assess a patient s baseline hemostatic function or to monitor the use of oral anticoagulants  such as warfarin 
warfarin is widely used in the united states for long term treatment in patients who have previously developed clots  including after heart attacks  to inhibit coagulation to reduce the risk of developing additional clots 
a physician uses the pt test to monitor and maintain drug levels within a safe treatment range  too little warfarin will not prevent a new clot from developing  and too much of the drug may result in a bleeding complication 
pharmanetics manufactures and markets three different types of pt test cards  a general purpose pt test card routinely used in the united states  the pt one  which uses a more sensitive scale of measurement  and the pt nc  which is used with finger stick samples 
the aptt test is a coagulation screening test which may be used in conjunction with the pt to provide a global assessment of a patient s ability to form a clot 
in addition  the aptt test is used to monitor heparin  an injectable anticoagulant 
hospitals routinely use heparin as the initial treatment for patients with a clot  including patients suffering from heart attacks or strokes 
heparin also prevents clots from forming in patients undergoing procedures involving particular risks of clotting  such as angiography  open heart surgery  dialysis and several other surgeries 
heparin must be closely monitored to assure adequate anticoagulation without increasing the risk of developing a bleeding complication 
time is particularly important when monitoring heparin  since the intravenously administered drug affects a patient s coagulation system within minutes 
generally  aptt tests are incapable of monitoring high levels of heparin 
the company developed and markets its hmt for monitoring patients requiring high dose heparin therapy during procedures such as open heart surgery or dialysis 
for example  during the course of an open heart surgery  the patient s blood may be tested as many as four to six times to assure an adequate heparin effect 
the company believes that its hmt is a more effective test than comparable tests because it is easier to use and less prone to operator error 
also  it is not sensitive to changes in blood temperature or dilution  such as typically occur during bypass surgery 
the company believes that hmt more closely correlates with a precise but time consuming laboratory measurement of heparin concentration than comparable tests 
the htt and prt test cards are combined with the hmt to provide a system for total individualized heparin management during cardiac surgery 
heparin management is complicated due to patients widely variable response to this drug as well as its clearance rate from the blood during surgery 
heparin dosing based on weight based protocols is often unreliable  particularly in complicated cases with patients receiving simultaneous therapy 
the company believes the htt prt approach should make it easier and cost effective to incorporate individual heparin management into routine practice 
the lhmt card is used principally in cardiac catheterization and interventional cardiology procedures 
it is designed to monitor the effects of concentrations of unfractionated heparin above the range of aptt but below that of the hmt 
the company markets it ect card under the fda s humanitarian device exemption program 
the ect card is used in managing patients suffering from heparin induced thrombocytopenia 
the fda s approval only allows the use of the test for managing patients who receive refludan while undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass 
test cards under development the company is continuing research and development focused on expanding the current menu of tests for the tas analyzer 
the company is currently researching and or developing the following new tests test description ecarin clotting time ect test to monitor direct thrombin inhibitors for use in patients treated for heart attack or prevention of deep vein thrombosis modified ecarin clotting time tim test to allow the monitoring of oral antithrombin drugs currently in fda phase 
table of contents development for treatment of dvt and atrial fibrillation 
synthetic xa inhibitors test designed to monitor the anticoagulant effect of pentasaccharides lr enox test to detect the anticoagulant effects of enoxaparin sodium in special patient populations receiving enoxparin for treatment of prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis lrf test to monitor the effects of ancrod  a fibrinogen lowering drug for the treatment of stroke sk panel test to assess response to streptokinase lysis onset time lot test to monitor a patient s lytic response to any thrombolytic drug used for the treatmentof heart attack  stroke or other thrombotic diseases quality control products the company also develops single use crush vial controls for each test card 
these controls are produced by the company and a contract manufacturer and allow quality assurance testing at the point of care 
in addition  the company sells an electronic quality control eqc card used to test analyzer function 
sales  marketing and distribution the company s current marketing strategy for its pt  aptt  hmt  prt  htt and lhmt test cards relies on a distribution partner 
in august  the company signed a five year global distribution agreement  subject to minimum annual sales  with chiron diagnostics corp  now a part of bayer  to distribute these test cards 
at that time  the company received an up front investment of million in exchange for  shares of common stock 
additionally  in april  bayer purchased  shares of common stock of the company at per share for million 
this investment increased bayer s ownership percentage in the company from approximately to 
in connection with the investment  the company and bayer entered into an amended distribution agreement to replace the previous distribution agreement 
under the terms of the amended agreement  bayer will purchase  at pre determined prices  the company s routine test cards identified in the agreement 
the company and bayer also expanded their relationship to cover collaborative distribution and supply of certain theranostic tests in the united states 
under the provisions of the agreement related to these speciality tests  bayer is responsible for taking the orders  shipping and collecting receivables for these tests sold by the company s sales team 
in return  bayer will receive a commission 
this arrangment enables the customer to order all of the company s products from a single source 
the initial term of this agreement expires on december   renewable thereafter for successive five year terms 
the company has the right to terminate the bayer agreement if bayer fails to make payments when due to the company  bayer fails to maintain sales to end users or a distributor appointed by bayer sells products which are competitive with the company 
either party may terminate the agreement upon the occurrence of any of the following the insolvency of the other party  material breach of the bayer agreement by the other party which is not cured  or certain types of change in control transactions by the other party 
the company also markets tas products in europe and other foreign countries and bayer is the company s exclusive distributor for all its products in these territories 
in addition  bayer has the contingent right to distribute outside the united states certain other theranostic test cards currently under development 
the company believes that bayer has a strong global presence and that its strategy for expanding rapid diagnostic platforms into critical care settings and its considerable presence in these specialized areas of the hospital will lead to increased placements of tas products 
the company also believes that the tas products are complementary with bayer s leading market position in blood gas analysis 
the company has a collaborative marketing program with aventis relating to the enox test that entails coordinating sales  marketing and educational efforts to promote the use of the test in the united states 
as part of this program  the company intends to hire a contract sales force of up to sales people located around the country  and contract technical service representatives  to work with aventis lovenox sales force  which numbers approximately the program provides for joint calls on qualified hospitals and joint marketing efforts 
the company anticipates that the enox test may facilitate the use of lovenox in some cardiology patients and in certain special populations 
pharmanetics believes the enox test may provide physicians with a tool to more confidently prescribe enoxaparin for all of their patients  because they can assess the anticoagulant state of patients who could be sent to the catheterization laboratory 
as noted above  bayer will market the enox test in other parts of the world and also is responsible for the distribution of these tests 
the commercial success of the company s products will depend upon their acceptance by the medical community as being useful and cost effective 
market acceptance will depend upon several factors  including the establishment of the utility and cost effectiveness of the company s tests and the receipt of regulatory clearances in the united states and elsewhere 
the availability 
table of contents of point of care hemostasis test systems has been limited to date  so by selling point of care hemostasis test products  the company is targeting an essentially new market 
diagnostic tests similar to those developed by the company are generally performed by a central laboratory at a hospital or clinic 
the approval of the purchase of diagnostic equipment by a hospital is generally controlled by its central laboratory 
the company expects central laboratories will resist yielding control of tests they have previously performed 
the company will also have to demonstrate to physicians that its diagnostic products perform as intended  meaning that the level of accuracy and precision attained by the company s products must be comparable to test results achieved by central laboratory systems 
failure of the company s products to achieve market acceptance would have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company is substantially dependent upon bayer as its principal distributor for marketing and distribution of its pt  aptt  hmt  htt  prt and lhmt test cards and the related controls and analyzer 
bayer will also market the enox test in foreign countries and will distribute the enox test worldwide 
there can be no assurance that bayer will be successful in its marketing or selling these products in sufficient volume to produce profitability for the company 
also  there can be no assurance that the company could build a cost effective and adequate sales and marketing staff to replace bayer in selling these routine products 
the loss of the company s distributor or the inability to enter into agreements with new distributors to sell tas products in additional countries could have a material adverse effect on the company 
collaborations the company s strategy is to increasingly focus on becoming a leader in the theranostic testing market  specifically managing new therapeutics which affect coagulation 
many drugs currently under development may require faster  more accurate assessment  given short half lives and narrow therapeutic windows  and thus the company believes physicians will increasingly demand therapeutic drug monitoring 
to further the goal of establishing itself in the emerging field of theranostics  the company has entered into development agreements with major pharmaceutical companies such as the medicines company and knoll ag now a part of abbott laboratories pursuant to which the company is developing test cards for potential use in patient identification and monitoring of therapies affecting coagulation being investigated by these companies 
in relation to the development of the ecarin clotting time cards to monitor direct thrombin inhibitors  the company has a worldwide exclusive sublicense from abbott to use the reagent associated with the test 
during  the company terminated an interim agreement with astrazeneca related to astra s development of an oral thrombin inhibitor and received a payment of million as part of the cessation of this agreement 
the company believes the medical community will embrace the need for a test for managing therapeutic levels in patients receiving oral and injectable direct thrombin inhibitors 
to this end  the company is presently in the process of collecting its own data and conducting clinical trials necessary to submit an fda application for this test 
the test would be used with three fda approved thrombin inhibitors on the market 
the company s intent is to enter into additional collaborations to expand its theranostic test card menu 
within the cardiovascular market  drugs affecting coagulation  such as thrombin inhibitors  platelet inhibitors and low molecular weight heparins  are under development by pharmaceutical companies 
the company s strategy is to increase its number of collaborations  expand current collaborations  increase involvement of leading research centers and physician thought leaders and further the involvement of bayer in working with other pharmaceutical companies to engage in outcome studies related to new theranostic tests 
the company s strategy is focusing its theranostic test development efforts on drugs in phase or phase development 
the company believes this will help reduce development risk as these drugs have a greater chance of approval than those just beginning clinical trials 
additionally  in the past under this collaboration model  the pharmaceutical company with whom the company is collaborating has paid for the clinical trials and provided the company access to the regulatory data associated with the test to be used in submitting a k notification 
this approach has allowed the company to cost effectively develop its tests 
competition the medical diagnostic testing industry is characterized by rapidly evolving technology and intense competition 
the current tas menu competes in the coagulation and hematology testing market with manufacturers that provide testing equipment to central and stat laboratories of hospitals 
these laboratories currently perform a substantial portion of such testing 
the tas menu also competes with other point of care coagulation and hematology test system manufacturers 
laboratories provide some of the same tests performed by tas  however  these laboratory tests generally require the use of skilled technicians and complex  expensive equipment 
the company believes that tas offers several advantages over these laboratory based instruments  including faster results  ease of use  reduced opportunity for error and cost effectiveness 
the company has several competitors  including roche diagnostics  international technidyne corporation itc and medtronic  that manufacture and market point of care coagulation and hematology test systems 
itc  in particular  has a large 
table of contents installed base of systems  which it has been selling for over years 
despite the fact that the company believes that tas competes favorably with these systems  itc s installed base could give it a competitive advantage 
the company believes that potential customers will base their purchasing decisions upon a combination of factors  including accuracy and precision  speed  cost effectiveness  data management  ease of use  compliance with clia guidelines  and availability of a comprehensive test menu 
if the company introduces additional blood tests beyond its initial coagulation and hematology tests  it will compete with other companies that market similar products to hospitals for use in laboratories and at the point of patient care 
other manufacturers and academic institutions may be conducting research and development with respect to blood testing technologies and other companies may in the future engage in research and development activities regarding products that compete with those of the company 
many of the companies in the medical technology industry  including those listed above  have substantially greater capital resources  research and development staffs  sales and manufacturing capabilities and manufacturing facilities than the company 
such entities may be developing or could in the future attempt to develop additional products competitive with tas 
many of these companies also have substantially greater experience than the company in research and development  obtaining regulatory clearances  manufacturing and marketing  and may therefore represent significant competition for the company 
there can be no assurance that the company s competitors will not succeed in developing or marketing technologies and products that will be more effective or less expensive than those being marketed by the company or that would render the company s technology and products obsolete or noncompetitive 
patents and other intellectual property the company pursues patent applications to provide protection from competitors 
a number of us and corresponding international patents have been issued to the company covering various aspects of the tas technology 
these patents expire between and the company has filed  and is pursuing  a number of additional us and international patent applications 
the company s success will depend in part on its ability to enforce its patents  to preserve its trade secrets and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties 
the company s ability to protect its proprietary position is also in part dependent on the issuance of additional patents on current and future applications 
no assurance can be given that any patent applications will be issued  that the scope of any patent protection will exclude competitors or provide competitive advantages to the company  that any of the company s patents will be held valid if subsequently challenged or that others will not claim rights in or ownership to the patents and other proprietary rights held by the company 
furthermore  others might have developed or will develop similar products  duplicate the company s products or design around the company s patents 
if any relevant claims of third party patents are upheld as valid and enforceable  the company could be prevented from practicing the subject matter claimed in such patents or could be required to obtain licenses from the patent owners of each of such patents or to redesign its products or processes to avoid infringement 
such licenses might not be available or  if available  could be on terms unacceptable to the company 
the company also relies upon unpatented trade secrets to protect its proprietary technology 
in particular  the company believes that its custom designed automated test card production line embodies proprietary process technology 
others may independently develop or otherwise acquire equivalent technology or otherwise gain access to the company s proprietary technology and the company might not ultimately be able to protect meaningful rights to such unpatented proprietary technology 
there has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry 
tokuyama soda license the company is a party to a license agreement with tokuyama soda company  ltd 
pursuant to which the company granted tokuyama exclusive rights to manufacture and sell pt and aptt tests and analyzers in myanmar  brunei  hong kong  indonesia  japan  malaysia  china  philippines  taiwan  south korea  singapore and thailand 
the tokuyama license requires that the company negotiate in good faith with tokuyama for days prior to marketing or licensing in these asian nations any new products that the company develops related to the licensed tests or analyzer technology 
until the earlier of october or the expiration of the last japanese patent covering the licensed technology  tokuyama must pay the company royalties based on tokuyama s net sales of licensed products 
the company can terminate the tokuyama license if tokuyama fails to make a required payment or report or makes a false report  or if tokuyama voluntarily ceases the manufacture and sale of licensed products for months  and if  in any such case  tokuyama fails to remedy such default within days after notice thereof from the company 
in december  the company and tokuyama amended the tokuyama license to  among other things  provide the company with the right to market pt and aptt tests and analyzers in an asian country other than japan  taiwan and south korea if tokuyama has not attained annual net sales of  in the country by june  or within months of the time when export to such country becomes authorized 
in the event the company exercises this right  it and tokuyama may both 
table of contents market in the country and must each pay royalties to the other 
to date  the company has not exercised this right 
the amendment also provides that the company owns all rights outside asia to improvements made by tokuyama to the company s technology  and must pay royalties to tokuyama based on the company net sales of products incorporating such improvements 
the company received royalty payments under this agreement of   and  during the years ended december    and  respectively 
manufacturing the company operates its manufacturing facility to assemble tas analyzers 
vendors currently provide all molded parts  mechanical components and printed circuit boards 
the company assembles the components and provides final mechanical  electrical and chemistry testing of each analyzer 
in addition  the company operates proprietary automated test card production equipment 
this automated production equipment was custom designed by the company and built to its specifications 
the company believes that this production machinery embodies proprietary process technology 
the equipment has been designed to allow for increased production as dictated by customer demand 
current annual manufacturing capacity is approximately million cards 
the fdc act requires the company to manufacture its products in registered establishments and in accordance with good manufacturing practice  or gmp  now known as quality system regulations  or qsr 
the company is registered as a medical device manufacturer and is subject to periodic inspections by the fda 
in addition  the company has maintained iso certification since to be successful  the company must manufacture its products in compliance with regulatory requirements  in sufficient quantities and on a timely basis  while maintaining product quality and acceptable manufacturing costs 
most of the raw materials and components used to manufacture the company s tas products are readily available 
however  some of these materials are obtained from a sole supplier or a limited group of suppliers 
piop and some reagents used in the tas test cards are obtained from single sources 
however  the company maintains enough supply to produce test cards for an extended period of time 
the company believes that  in the event of an interruption in the availability of supplies  the company has enough supply at its facility to fulfill its needs until an alternative source can be procured 
the company seeks to maintain long term agreements with its suppliers when possible 
the reliance on sole or limited suppliers and the inability to maintain long term agreements with suppliers involves several risks  including the inability to obtain an adequate supply of required raw materials and components and reduced control over pricing  quality and timely delivery 
any interruption in supply could have a material adverse effect on the company 
government regulation fda the medical devices marketed and manufactured by the company are subject to extensive regulation by the fda 
pursuant to the fdc act  the fda regulates the clinical testing  manufacture  design control  labeling  distribution and promotion of medical devices 
noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in  among other things fines injunction civil penalties recall or seizure of products total or partial suspension of production failure of the government to grant premarket clearance or premarket approval pma for devices withdrawal of marketing approvals or criminal prosecution 
the fda also has the authority to request repair  replacement or refund of the cost of any device manufactured or distributed by the company 
before a new device can be introduced into the market  the manufacturer must generally obtain marketing clearance through either a k notification  the hde process or the more time consuming pma process 
all of the company s currently cleared products have qualified for either the k process or the accelerated hde process 
commercial distribution of a device for which a k is required can begin only after the fda issues an order finding the device to be substantially equivalent to a predicate legally marketed medical device 
the fda has recently been requiring a more rigorous demonstration of substantial equivalence than in the past 
it generally takes from four to twelve months from submission of a k application to obtain a k clearance  but it might take longer 
the fda might determine that a proposed device is not substantially 
table of contents equivalent to a legally marketed device  or that additional information is needed before a substantial equivalence determination can be made 
a request for additional data might require that additional clinical studies of the device s safety and efficacy be performed 
a not substantially equivalent determination or a request for additional information could delay the market introduction of new products that fall into this category and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
for any of the company s products that are cleared through the k process  modifications or enhancements that could significantly affect the safety or efficacy of the device or that constitute a major change to the intended use of the device will require a new k 
if the fda requires the company to submit a new k for any modification to the device  the company might be prohibited from marketing the modified device until the k is cleared by the fda 
pursuant to fda policy  manufacturers of devices labeled for investigational use only must establish a controlled program under which investigational devices are distributed to or utilized only by individuals  laboratories or healthcare facilities that have provided the manufacturer with a written certification of compliance indicating that the device will be used for investigational purposes only  results will not be used for diagnostic purposes without confirmation of the diagnosis under another medically established diagnostic device or procedure  all investigations will be conducted with approval from an institutional review board  or irb  using an irb approved study protocol  and patient informed consent  and the device will be labeled  and labeling will be maintained  in accordance with the applicable labeling regulations failure of the company or recipients of the company s investigational use only products to comply with these requirements could result in enforcement action by the fda that would adversely affect the company s ability to conduct testing necessary to obtain market clearance and  consequently  could have a material adverse effect on the company 
any products manufactured or distributed by the company pursuant to fda clearances or approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the fda  including recordkeeping requirements and reporting of adverse experiences with the use of the device 
device manufacturers are required to register their facilities and list their devices with the fda  and are subject to periodic inspections by the fda and certain state agencies 
the fdc act requires devices to be designed and manufactured in accordance with qsr regulations which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon the company with respect to design  manufacturing and quality assurance activities 
the fda has approved changes to the regulations which will increase and have increased the cost of complying with qsr requirements 
labeling and promotion activities are subject to scrutiny by the fda and in certain instances by the federal trade commission 
the fda actively enforces regulations prohibiting marketing of products for unapproved uses 
regulations on export export of products that have market clearance from the fda in the united states does not require fda authorization 
however  foreign countries often require an fda certificate for products for export  or cpe 
to obtain a cpe  the device manufacturer must certify to the fda that the product has been granted clearance in the united states and that the manufacturing facilities appeared to be in compliance with qsrs at the time of the last fda inspection 
the fda will refuse to issue a cpe if significant outstanding qsr violations exist 
export of products subject to the k requirements  but not yet cleared to market  are permitted without fda authorization provided certain requirements are met 
unapproved products subject to the pma requirements must be approved by the fda for export 
to obtain fda export approvals certain requirements must be met and information must be provided to the fda  including documentation demonstrating that the product is approved for import into the country to which it is to be exported and  in some instances  safety data from animal or human studies 
there can be no assurance that the fda will grant export approval when such approval is necessary  or that the countries to which the devices are to be exported will approve the devices for import 
products which the company exports that do not have premarket clearance in the united states include the lot test  the ect test and the modified ect test 
the company has obtained cpes for these tests 
failure of the company to obtain a cpe for the export of its products in the future could have a material adverse effect on the company the company believes that these products are subject to the k requirements and  consequently  has not requested fda approval for export 
however  there can be no assurance that the fda would agree with the company that a k is needed rather than a pma 
if the fda disagreed  it could significantly delay and impair the company s ability to continue exporting these tests and could have a material adverse effect on the company 

table of contents foreign regulations sales of the company s test products outside the united states are also subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country 
these laws and regulations range from simple product registration requirements in some countries to complex clearance and production controls in others 
as a result  the processes and time periods required to obtain foreign marketing approval may be longer or shorter than those necessary to obtain fda approval 
these differences may affect the efficiency and timeliness of international market introduction of the company s products  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain regulatory approvals or clearances for its products in foreign countries 
delays in receipt of  or a failure to receive  such approvals or clearances  or the loss of any previously received approvals or clearances  could have a material adverse effect on the company 
in order to market the company s products in the member countries of the european union  the company is required to comply with the european invitro diagnostics directive and to obtain ce mark certification for the tas analyzer 
the ce mark denotes conformity with european standards for safety and allows certified devices to be placed on the market in all eu countries 
medical devices may not be sold in eu countries unless they display the ce mark 
all of the applicable company products marketed in europe have obtained ce mark certification 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in maintaining ce mark certification of its products 
the tas analyzer also must and does meet the requirements of the electromagnetic capability directive 
in japan  the company relies upon its collaborative partner  tokuyama  to comply with applicable regulations regarding the product listing  manufacture and sale of products in that country 
the company believes that the company s products are in compliance with applicable regulations in japan 
failure to maintain ce mark certification in europe or to obtain or maintain other foreign regulatory approvals could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
clia the company s products are also subject to the requirements of the clinical laboratory improvement act of  or clia 
the clia requires all laboratories  including those performing blood chemistry tests  to meet specified standards in the areas of personnel qualification  administration  participation in proficiency testing  patient test management  quality control  quality assurance and inspections 
the regulations have established three levels of regulatory control based on test complexity waived  moderate complexity and high complexity 
the pt  aptt  hmt  htt  prt  lhmt and enox tests performed by tas have been categorized by the fda and the centers for disease control and prevention as moderate complexity tests 
there can be no assurance that these tests will not be recategorized  or that other tests performed by the tas will not be categorized as high complexity tests or that such a categorization will not have a material adverse effect on the company 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that regulations under and future administrative interpretations of clia will not have an adverse impact on the potential market for the company s products 
laboratories that perform either moderate or high complexity tests must meet certain standards  with the major difference in requirements being quality control and personnel standards 
quality control standards for moderate complexity tests not modified by laboratories are being implemented by the fda in stages  while laboratories performing high complexity and modified moderate complexity tests currently must meet all of the quality control requirements 
personnel standards for high complexity tests require that personnel have more education and experience than personnel conducting moderate complexity tests 
all laboratories performing moderately complex or highly complex tests are required to obtain either a registration certificate or certification of accreditation from the health care financing administration 
with certain specified exceptions  each site for laboratory testing must file a separate application and separately meet all clia requirements 
multiple laboratory sites within a hospital located at contiguous buildings on the same campus and under common direction may file a single application 
as a result of the clia requirements  hospitals may be discouraged from expanding point of care testing 
because clia certification must be obtained by laboratories  the company does not possess sufficient data to make a determination as to the cost of certification to a laboratory or the potential inhibiting effect of clia certification on the purchase of the company s products by laboratories 
other regulations the company and its products are also subject to a variety of state and local laws and regulations in those states or localities where its products are or will be marketed 
any applicable state or local laws or regulations might hinder the company s ability to market its products in those states or localities 
use of the company s products will also be subject to inspection  quality control  quality assurance  proficiency testing  documentation and safety reporting standards pursuant to the joint commission on accreditation of healthcare organizations 
various states and municipalities might also have similar regulations 
manufacturers are also subject to numerous federal  state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working 
table of contents conditions  manufacturing practices  environmental protection  fire hazard control and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances 
there can be no assurance that the company will not be required to incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future or that such laws or regulations will not have a material adverse effect upon the company 
changes in existing requirements or adoption of new requirements or policies could adversely affect the ability of the company to comply with regulatory requirements 
reimbursement the company s ability to commercialize its products successfully may depend in part on the extent to which reimbursement for the cost of such products and related treatment will be available from government health administration authorities such as the health care financing administration  or hcfa  which determines medicare reimbursement levels  private health insurers and other organizations payors 
payors are increasingly challenging the prices of medical products and services 
payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that a prescribed device has not received appropriate fda or other governmental regulatory clearances  is not used in accordance with cost effective treatment methods  or is experimental  unnecessary or inappropriate 
in addition  under current hcfa regulations  equipment costs generally are not reimbursed separately  but rather are included in a single  fixed rate  per patient reimbursement 
also  the trend towards managed healthcare in the united states and the concurrent growth of organizations such as hmos  which could control or significantly influence the purchase of healthcare services and products  as well as legislative proposals to reform healthcare or reduce government insurance programs  might result in customers demanding lower prices for the company s tas products 
the cost containment measures that healthcare providers are instituting and the impact of any healthcare reform could have an adverse effect on the company s ability to sell its products and may have a material adverse effect on the company 
there can be no assurance that reimbursement in the united states or foreign countries will be available for any of the company s products  or that if available it will not be decreased in the future  or that any reduction in reimbursement amounts will not reduce the demand for or the price of the company s products 
the unavailability of third party reimbursement or the inadequacy of the reimbursement for medical procedures using the company s tests would have a material adverse effect on the company 
moreover  the company is unable to forecast what additional legislation or regulations  if any  relating to the healthcare industry or third party coverage and reimbursement may be enacted in the future or what effect such legislation or regulations would have on the company 
product liability and insurance the company faces an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of its products is alleged to have resulted in adverse effects 
the company maintains product liability insurance with coverage of up to million per claim  with an annual aggregate policy limit of million 
there can be no assurance that liability claims will not exceed the coverage limits of such policies or that such insurance will continue to be available on commercially acceptable terms  or at all 
consequently  product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
employees the company had employees as of december  fourteen employees were engaged in research and development of which have ph d s  in manufacturing and quality control  in software  engineering and facilities  in sales marketing and in finance administration 
many of the company s executive and technical personnel have had experience with biomedical diagnostics companies 
none of the company s employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement and the company believes that employee relations are good 
the company s success depends to a significant extent upon management and technical personnel  none of whom have employment agreements with the company 
although the company maintains a  key man life insurance policy on its chief executive officer  the loss of the service of this officer could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company also believes that its future success will depend in large part upon its ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical  management and sales and marketing personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  and there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 
the company s failure to attract  hire and retain these personnel would have a material adverse effect on the company

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview pharmanetics  inc  through its wholly owned subsidiary cardiovascular diagnostics  inc cvdi  develops  manufactures and markets rapid turnaround diagnostics to assess blood clot formation and dissolution 
the company s products are a proprietary analyzer and dry chemistry tests  known as the thrombolytic assessment system or tas that provide  at the point of patient care  rapid and accurate evaluation of hemostasis 
pharmanetics is also establishing itself in the emerging field of theranostics  or rapid near patient testing  in which the diagnostic results may influence treatment decisions 
current tests and tests under development are used in the treatment of angina  heart attack  stroke  deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary and arterial emboli 
the tas technology is used at the point of patient care which provides many potential benefits  including faster results for better treatment of patients  reduced usage of blood products for bleeding complications  quicker patient transfers from costly critical care settings and reduced hospital costs due to less paperwork and personnel time in processing blood samples 
the company currently derives income from the following sources tas product sales  interest income  and development income recognized in connection with collaboration agreements 
currently  product sales mainly consist of the company s routine test cards  the pt  aptt  hmt  htt  prt and lhmt tests along with the related controls and analyzers 
these products are distributed under a global distribution agreement with bayer diagnostics 
bayer s strength is in critical care areas of the hospital which the company believes should facilitate the placement of the tas technology 
the company s revenue from bayer totaled approximately of all revenue during in addition  the company s business strategy has evolved towards becoming more focused on theranostics  the development of specialty tests for drugs  some with narrow ranges between over and under dosage 
rapid diagnostic capabilities might improve patient care and turnover  and there is a market trend to obtain diagnostic information faster in order to effect therapy sooner 
the company believes that physicians are beginning to see the need for drug management tools and  consequently  the company is seeking greater involvement of physician thought leaders during development of new test cards 
the company also believes that these trends should allow the company to obtain higher pricing of these specialty tests 
in furtherance of that objective  the company commercially launched its first theranostic test  the enox test  in january to detect the anticoagulant effects of enoxaparin sodium  a leading low molecular weight heparin marketed by aventis 
the company s test is being sold through a coordinated advertising  marketing and educational program with aventis 
the company has hired contract sales and technical service personnel to work with aventis sales force in promoting the test 
the company also has exhibited the flexibility of the tas platform and the potential to expand its menu of specialty tests by signing development agreements with major pharmaceutical companies to monitor the effects of certain new drugs that are in clinical trials or currently being marketed 
increased placement of specialty tests might also further demand for analyzers and routine anticoagulant tests 
the company believes it is well positioned in its development efforts to expand its menu of tests to monitor developmental drugs where rapid therapeutic intervention is needed 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates  judgments and the policies underlying these estimates on a periodic basis as the situation changes  and regularly discuss financial events  policies  and issues with our independent accountants and members of our audit committee 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of our accounting policies that affect our financial condition and results of operations

the use of cash was principally due to funding the net operating loss of the company and increased inventories to support expected product sale increases 
the operating uses of cash were partially offset by funding provided through the collaboration with aventis that was recorded as deferred revenue 
net cash used in investing activities was million in net cash provided by investing activities was  in the net cash used mainly resulted from expenditures for new machinery and management information systems equipment 
the company expects capital expenditures in to be lower than in and to range from  to  cash provided by financing activities was million in as compared to million in in  the company obtained a year million equipment loan from ge capital 
as of december   the outstanding balance under the ge capital loan was approximately the full million

in addition to the capital expenditures noted above  the company expects to incur additional operating losses during  including additional sales and marketing expenses to support the new contract salesforce 
the company s working capital requirements will depend on many factors  primarily the volume of subsequent orders of tas products from distributors  primarily bayer  and from sales of specialty test cards such as the enoxaparin test 
in addition  the company expects to incur costs associated with research and development of new test cards 
the company might acquire other products  technologies or businesses that complement the company s existing and planned products  although the company currently has no understanding  commitment or agreement with respect to any such acquisitions 
in addition  the company might consider a joint venture or the sale of manufacturing rights to complete the commercialization of its routine anticoagulant monitoring tests 
management believes that its existing capital resources and cash flows from operations  including that from its distribution agreement with bayer  will be adequate to satisfy its planned liquidity and cash requirements through if additional liquidity becomes necessary in the future  the company will consider external sources of financing as needed 
these financings may take the form of equity financings such as a private placement of common or preferred stock  a follow on public offering of common stock or additional equity infusions from collaborative partners 
the common stock purchase agreement with bayer contains a provision that  upon the occurrence of a change in control  as defined in the agreement  the company would be required to compensate bayer  in cash or shares of common stock  for any difference between per share prices originally paid by bayer and the amount received by the company s shareholders in the change of control transaction 
in accordance with applicable accounting guidelines  the company previously transferred to temporary equity an amount equal to the change in control payment called for by the purchase agreement 
because this change of control provision expired on december   the company has transferred that amount from temporary equity back to permanent equity 
contractual obligations the company has contractual obligations under notes payable  capital and operating lease agreements for years subsequent to future payments as of december  are as follows year ending december  notes payable capital leases operating leases total thereafter total payments recent accounting pronouncements in  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
this statement requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after june  the company does not presently have any asset retirement obligations  and thus this statement is not expected to materially impact the results of operations  financial condition  or cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued statement no 
fas  accounting for exit or disposal activities 
fas addresses significant issues regarding the recognition  measurement  and reporting of costs that are associated with exit and disposal activities  including restructuring activities that are currently accounted for pursuant to the guidance set forth in emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the scope of fas includes costs related to terminating a contract that is not a capital lease termination benefits received by employees who are involuntarily terminated under the terms of a one time benefit arrangement that is not an ongoing benefit arrangement or an individual deferred 
table of contents compensation contract and costs to consolidate facilities or relocate employees 
fas will be effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  the company does not expect this pronouncement to have a material impact on its financial statements 
in december the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas no 
amends the disclosure requirements of sfas to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
these provisions of sfas no 
are effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after december  the company has not and does not anticipate implementing the voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation 
the company has implemented the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
beginning with the december  consolidated financial statements 
on november   the emerging issues task force concluded on eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables which is proposed to be effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after december  eitf requires an analysis of whether a delivered item has stand alone value to the customer  there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items  and the delivery of the undelivered item is probable and substantially within the control of the vendor if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item 
as a consequence  the application of eitf may result in the acceleration of revenues for some arrangements and the deferral of revenue for others  even though eitf does not address the timing or pattern of revenue recognition for a unit of accounting 
the staff also noted that although the sab guidance that relates to multiple element arrangements will be superseded by eitf  the revenue recognition guidance in sab will still apply to units of accounting that other authoritative literature does not specifically address with respect to revenue recognition 
this statement did not have a material effect on the results of operations  financial condition  or cash flows 
on november   the financial standards board issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others an interpretation of fasb statements no 
 and and rescission of fasb interpretation no 

fin clarifies the requirements of fasb statement no 
 accounting for contingencies  relating to a guarantor s accounting for  and disclosure of  the issuance of certain types of guarantees 
the company does not anticipate this statement to materially impact the results of operations  financial condition  or cash flows 
factors that might affect future results a number of uncertainties exist that might affect the company s future operating results and stock price 
there can be no assurance that new tests  particularly specialty tests  can be developed  receive regulatory approval  and be commercialized and accepted in the market 
other risks include market acceptance of tas  the company s continuing losses and the resulting potential need for additional capital in the future  managed care and continuing market consolidation  which may result in price pressure  particularly on routine tests  competition within the diagnostic testing industry and fda regulations and other regulatory guidelines affecting the company and or its collaborators 
the market price of the common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to variations in the company s quarterly operating results as well as other factors which may be unrelated to the company s performance 
the stock market in recent years has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of and announcements concerning public companies 
such broad fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
securities of issuers having relatively limited capitalization are particularly susceptible to volatility based on short term trading strategies of certain investors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk in the normal course of business  the company is exposed to variety of risks including market risk associated with interest rate movements 
the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to any investments the company may hold at various times and also related to its long term debt 
when investing  the company s purchases consist of highly liquid investments with maturities at the date of purchase between three and twelve months  thus  due to the short term nature of such investments and the company s usual intention to hold these investments until maturity  the impact of interest rate changes would not have a material impact on the company s results of operations 
in addition  all of the company s long term debt obligations are at fixed interest rates 
given the fixed rate nature of the debt  the impact of interest rate changes also would not have a material impact on the company s results of operations
