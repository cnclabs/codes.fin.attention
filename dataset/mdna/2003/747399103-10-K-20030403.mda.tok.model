critical accounting estimates the following is a brief discussion of the more significant accounting estimates used by the company 
general the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
the most significant estimates and assumptions relate to accounts receivable reserves  inventory valuation and inventory reserves  and self insurance reserves 
actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns and allowances the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and adjusts credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current creditworthiness  as determined by management s review of their current credit information 
the company continuously monitors collections and payments from its customers and maintains a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within expectations and the provisions established  the company cannot guarantee that credit loss rates in the future will be consistent with those experienced in the past 
the company s accounts receivable are spread among more than  customers and no single customer represents more than of the accounts receivable balance at january management analyzes historical sales and quality returns  current economic trends  and the company s quality performance when evaluating the adequacy of the reserve for sales returns and allowances 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the reserve for sales returns and allowances in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of the company s net sales for any period if management makes different judgments or uses different estimates 
inventories inventory is valued using the last in  first out lifo method 
approximately of finished goods are produced upon receipt of a firm order 
management  in partnership with key customers  is utilizing forecasting techniques to significantly reduce delivery lead times 
management regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on historical information and estimated forecasts of product demand and raw material requirements for the next twelve months 
a significant increase in demand for the company s products could result in a short term increase in manufacturing costs  including but not limited to overtime and other costs related to capacity constraints in certain areas of the company 
a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
additionally  assumptions used in determining management s estimates of future product demand may prove to be incorrect  in which case the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory would have to be adjusted in the future 
if inventory is determined to be overvalued  the company would be required to recognize such costs as cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
therefore  although every effort is made to ensure the accuracy of management s forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the value of the company s inventory and the company s reported operating results 
self insurance reserves the company is self insured for workers compensation and medical insurance 
quaker has also purchased stop loss coverage for both types of risks in order to minimize the effect of a catastrophic level of claims 
at the end of each accounting period  the reserves for incurred but not reported claims must be evaluated 
management evaluates claims experience on a regular basis in consultation with the company s insurance advisors and makes adjustments to these reserves 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with evaluating the adequacy of self insurance reserves 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of these costs for any period if management makes different judgments or uses different estimates 
property  plant and equipment property  plant and equipment is depreciated over the estimated useful lives 
useful lives are based on management s estimates of the period that the assets will generate revenue 
these assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
reductions in the useful lives of the company s fixed assets would have an adverse impact on the company s financial results 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this statement requires that the company recognize a current tax liability or asset for current taxes payable or refundable and a deferred tax liability or asset for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences and carryforwards to the extent they are realizable 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the company s deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while management has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event management were to determine that the company would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should management determine that the company would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
the company does not provide for united states income taxes on earnings of subsidiaries outside of the united states 
the company s intention is to reinvest these earnings permanently or to repatriate the earnings only when tax effective to do so 
management believes that united states foreign tax credits would largely eliminate any united states taxes or offset any foreign withholding taxes

cautionary statement regarding forward looking information statements contained in this report  as well as oral statements made by the company that are prefaced with the words may  will  expect  anticipate  continue  estimate  project  intend  designed and similar expressions  are intended to identify forward looking statements regarding events  conditions and financial trends that may affect the company s future plans of operations  business strategy  results of operations and financial position 
these statements are based on the company s current expectations and estimates as to prospective events and circumstances about which the company can give no firm assurance 
further  any forward looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made  and the company undertakes no obligation to update any forward looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made 
as it is not possible to predict every new factor that may emerge  forward looking statements should not be relied upon as a prediction of the company s actual future financial condition or results 
these forward looking statements like any forward looking statements  involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or unanticipated 
such risks and uncertainties include product demand and market acceptance of the company s products  regulatory uncertainties  the effect of economic conditions  the impact of competitive products and pricing  foreign currency exchange rates  changes in customers ordering patterns  and the effect of uncertainties in markets outside the us including mexico and south america in which the company operates 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments  and derivative commodity instruments quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposures relative to market risk are due to foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk 
foreign currency risk approximately of the company s revenues are generated outside the us from sales which are not denominated in us dollars 
foreign currency risk arises because the company engages in business in mexico and brazil in local currency 
accordingly  in the absence of hedging activities whenever the us dollar strengthens relative to the other major currencies  there is an adverse affect on the company s results of operations  and alternatively  whenever the us dollar weakens relative to the other major currencies  there is a positive affect on the company s results of operations 
it is the company s policy to minimize  for a period of time  the unforeseen impact on its results of operations of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates by using derivative financial instruments to hedge the fair value of foreign currency denominated intercompany payables 
the company s primary foreign currency exposures in relation to the us dollar are the mexican peso and brazilian real 
at january   the company had the following significant derivative financial instruments to hedge the anticipated cash flows from the repayment of foreign currency denominated intercompany payables outstanding notional weighted amount in average notional local contract amount in fair type of instrument currency currency rate us dollars value maturity forward contract mexican peso million million  march forward contract brazilian real million million  february currency swap mexican peso million million  march the company estimated the change in the fair value of all derivative financial instruments assuming both a strengthening and weakening of the us dollar relative to all other major currencies 
in the event of a strengthening of the us dollar  the change in fair value of all derivative financial instruments would result in approximately a million unrealized gain  whereas a weakening of the us dollar would result in approximately a million unrealized loss 
interest rate risk approximately of the company s long term debt is at fixed rates 
accordingly  a change in interest rates has an insignificant effect on the company s interest expense 
the fair value of the company s long term debt  however  would change in response to interest rate movements due to its fixed rate nature 
using a scenario analysis  the company has evaluated the impact on all long term maturities of changing the interest rate from the rate levels that existed at january  and has determined that such a rate change would not have a material impact on the company
