item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation introduction telular corporation the company designs  develops  manufactures and markets products based on its proprietary interface technologies 
these products provide the capability to connect standard telecommunications equipment  including standard telephones  fax machines  data modems and alarm panels with wireless communication networks in the cellular and pcs frequency bands collectively cellular 
bridging the gap between wireline customer premises equipment and cellular networks  these technologies provide the company s products with the look and feel of the wireline network  providing critical communications and security needs in a variety of environments 
the company s business segments are divided between its two principal product lines phonecell r  a line of cellular fixed wireless terminals and cellular fixed wireless desktop phones collectively fixed wireless terminals or fwts  and telguard r  a line of wireless security products 
fundamental to the company s continued success is a strategy encompassing strong investment in technology  product design  and applications development 
as a company  we are committed to delivering solutions for today s networks  while investing in technology advancements for the constantly evolving wireless arena 
the company s operating expense levels are based in large part on expectations of future revenues 
if anticipated sales in any fiscal quarter do not occur as expected  expenditure and inventory levels could be disproportionately high  and the company s operating results for that fiscal quarter  and potentially for future fiscal quarters  could be adversely affected 
certain factors that could significantly impact expected results are described in cautionary statements pursuant to the securities litigation reform act that is set forth in exhibit to this document 
overview wireless local loop wll is the foundation business for the company 
it is this technique that defines our core value proposition 
in developing countries where wireline service is deficient or non existent  our products provide basic telephone service over existing cellular networks as well as new networks being constructed to expand telephone service in those countries 
the developed world  including the us and western europe  has the luxury of choice when it comes to telecommunications services 
digitization  capacity improvements  high speed data  and boundary less roaming have contributed to the success that wireless operators have enjoyed through the late s 
pervasive network coverage and lower airtime rates are driving consumers to increased wireless usage in all parts of their lives  both professional and personal 
as a result  some consumers are beginning to abandon their wired phone service altogether in favor of wireless service 
after years of steady growth  wireless carriers are experiencing a slow down in mobile subscriber growth and revenue growth 
as a result of this trend many wireless carriers are considering campaigns to displace wired phone service in order to expand their revenue base 
a market of replacing wired phone service with wireless phone service is evolving in europe in the business sector  and is beginning to emerge in the residential sector in the us 
for our business  success in these developed markets is a long sought after goal 
to date  the majority of our revenues has come from the international theater 
however  the larger and more significant opportunities for revenue are in western europe and north america 
we believe the trends are in our favor 
in particular  in the us the recent regulatory requirement for wireline to wireless local number portability has removed a significant obstacle to the adoption of fixed wireless service by consumers 
wireline to wireless local number portability may prove to be an industry changing catalyst to bring fixed wireless to prominence in the developed world 
allowing a customer to retain his or her telephone number when changing from a wireline to a wireless system makes such a switch significantly more customer friendly and this may encourage carriers to expand their marketing and development efforts in this direction 
the company s products are well suited to support fixed wireless applications 
although most programs are in their early stages  the company is actively involved in consulting  providing product samples  and driving the direction of cellular fixed wireless adoption in the usa and europe 
the company s strategy is to continue to pursue each of the markets and regions we serve throughout the world 
our years in this industry have shown us that our products can serve needs common to all markets as well as individual needs required by each region 
we design our internationally accepted products to help operators meet their business and revenue goals 
the company believes that its future success depends on its ability to continue to meet customers needs through product innovation  rapid time to market with new products  and superior in market customer support 
current product lines deploy the major worldwide cellular air interface standards gsm  cdma  tdma and amps 
now with products based on next generation technologies  gprs and cdma r x solutions also firmly in place  we expect to build on our robust product portfolio in fiscal year with new applications for our gsm product line  new sx based cdma models  and gsm and cdma based digital security solutions 
fabrication of the company s products is accomplished through a combination of in house assembly and contract manufacturing 
contract manufacturers make and test all printed circuit boards for the company 
the final assembly of phonecell r and telguard r products is performed at our facility in vernon hills  illinois  and by contract manufacturers in mexico and china 
the cellular fixed wireless industry consists of large domestic and international telecommunications equipment companies  many of which have substantially greater resources than those of the telular  and includes companies such as nokia  ericsson and lg electronics 
many smaller companies and startups present competition to telular in markets where enforcement of our patent protection is not available or practicable 
competing with these companies in price sensitive environments is challenging  but telular does so on the basis of our higher product quality and reliability  state of the art technology and enhanced features  rapid product innovation and customer support 
although the company s contribution to the wireless security products industry has been focused on the north american market  the new gsm telguard r tg product may open up the wireless security products market for the company on a global basis 
the competitive environment in the wireless security products industry is dominated by a few major equipment suppliers  who have leveraged proprietary systems to maintain their market share 
products in this market have historically been based on analog technology 
because demand for analog service in the us is predicted to decline over time  the company is developing products based on digital technology 
the company has adopted an innovator role  and has competed successfully by introducing innovative new wireless technology into the marketplace 
with respect to its interface technology  the company currently has issued patents and pending patent applications in the united states  as well as foreign patents and pending foreign patent applications 
the company has successfully defended its patents in court
