item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the gymboree corporation was founded in as a provider of interactive parent child play programs and began to franchise this business in in  we opened our first retail store featuring children s apparel and accessories 
through the end of  we had grown to stores  including stores in states and the district of columbia including janie and jack stores  stores in canada and stores in europe 
gymboree s net sales for increased to million from million in and million in our net income totaled million in compared to million in  and a net loss of million in comparable store net sales  based on a week period  increased during versus  during versus  and decreased in versus we expect that future increases in net sales and net income will be dependent on the ability to generate increased sales within existing stores  the opening of new store locations  and generating profitability in international stores 
gymboree s year end is on the saturday closest to january fiscal year  which included weeks  ended on february  fiscal and  which included and weeks  ended on february  and february   respectively 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we identified our most critical accounting policies and estimates to be those related to inventory valuation  asset impairment  workers compensation  sales return reserve and income taxes 
inventory valuation 
inventory is valued using the retail method of accounting and is stated at the lower of cost or market 
we review our inventory levels in order to identify slow moving merchandise and broken assortments items no longer in stock in a sufficient range of sizes and use markdowns to clear merchandise 
we estimate shortage for the period between the last physical count and the balance sheet date 
our shortage estimate can be affected by changes in merchandise mix and changes in actual shortage trends 
asset impairment 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
if the undiscounted future cash flows from the long lived assets are less than the carrying value  we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the assets 
decisions to close a store or facility can also result in accelerated depreciation over the revised useful life 
for locations to be closed which are under long term leases  we record a charge for lease buyout expense or the difference between our rent and the rate at which we expect to be able to sublease the properties and related cost  as appropriate 
most closures occur upon the lease expiration 
our estimate of future cash flows is based on our experience  knowledge and typically third party advice or market data 
however  these estimates can be affected by factors such as future store profitability  real estate demand and economic conditions that can be difficult to predict 
workers compensation 
gymboree is primarily self insured for workers compensation insurance 
the company records its self insurance liability based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported 
should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated or costs of the claims increase beyond what was anticipated  reserves recorded may not be sufficient and additional accruals may be required in future periods 
sales return reserve 
the company records a reserve for estimated product returns based on historical return trends 
if actual returns are greater than those projected by management  additional sales returns may be recorded in the future 
income taxes 
we record reserves for estimates of probable settlements of domestic and foreign tax audits 
at any one time  many tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions 
the results of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may affect the ultimate settlement of these issues 
our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings

seasonality and quarterly fluctuations gymboree has historically experienced  and expects to continue to experience  seasonal fluctuations in our retail sales and net income 
historically  a disproportionate amount of our retail sales and a significant portion of our net income have been realized during the months of november and december 
in anticipation of increased sales activity during these months  gymboree hires a significant number of temporary employees to bolster the store staff 
in addition  we have experienced periods of increased sales activity in early spring and early fall 
if  for any reason  our sales were below seasonal norms during november and december  or during the early spring or early fall  our annual operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
historically  retail sales and net income have been weakest during the second fiscal quarter  and we expect this trend to continue 
gymboree s quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors  including the timing of new store openings  the costs and increased overhead associated with the opening and future operation of new stores 
in addition  the sales contributed by new stores  advertising and marketing expenditures  merchandise mix and timing  and level of markdowns may contribute to fluctuations in operating performance
