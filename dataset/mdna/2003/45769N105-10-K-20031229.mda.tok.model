overview innovative solutions and support was founded in we design  develop  manufacture and market flight information computers  large flat panel displays and advanced monitoring systems that measure and display 
table of contents critical flight information  including data relative to aircraft separation rvsm  airspeed and altitude as well as engine and fuel data measurements 
our sales are derived from the sale of our products to the retrofit market and  to a lesser extent  original equipment manufacturers oems 
our customers include government and military entities and their commercial contractors  aircraft operators  aircraft modification centers and various oems 
although we occasionally sell our products directly to government entities  we primarily have sold our products to commercial customers for end use in government and military programs 
these sales to commercial contractors are on commercial terms  although some of the termination and other provisions of government contracts are applicable to these contracts 
we record net sales when our products are shipped 
since fiscal year  the majority of our sales have come from the sale of rvsm compliant air data systems 
this included a significant amount of sales to commercial contractors in connection with the us air force kc retrofit program 
we were the sole supplier of these systems and components under subcontracts with various commercial contractors for the retrofit program  which covered approximately kc aircraft 
we completed deliveries on this retrofit program during net sales under the kc retrofit program represented  and of our net sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
our cost of sales are comprised of material components purchased through our supplier base and direct in house assembly labor and overhead costs 
many of the components we use in assembling our products are standard  although certain parts are manufactured to meet our specifications 
the overhead portion of cost of sales is primarily comprised of salaries and benefits  building occupancy  supplies  and outside service costs related to our production  purchasing  material control and quality departments as well as warranty costs 
we intend to continue investing in the development of new products that complement our current product offerings and will expense associated research and development costs as they are incurred 
our selling  general and administrative expenses consist of sales  marketing  business development  professional services and salaries and benefits for executive and administrative personnel as well as facility costs  recruiting  legal  accounting and other general corporate expenses 
results of operations fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september net sales 
net sales in fiscal were million 
this amount was essentially unchanged from the million recorded in fiscal the sales mix  however  reflected some significant changes as evidenced in a drop off from the completed kc business from million in fiscal to only million in fiscal this million reduction was offset with replacement rvsm business from several customers  including garrett  northwest airlines and bombardier and cip revenues from the lcac and boeing programs 
cost of sales 
cost of sales remained flat at million or  of net sales  for fiscal from million  or of net sales  for fiscal research and development 
research and development expenses decreased million  or  to million  or of net sales  for fiscal from million  or of net sales  for fiscal the decline in both dollar amount and percent of sales was the result of the following in fiscal the company expensed million of certification cost that was incurred in prior periods and carried as an intangible asset supporting flat panel certification on the pilatus airplane 
the decision to change our initial launch aircraft from a pilatus pc to a boeing necessitated recognizing the change at that time 
as a result  fiscal s research and development spending was lower by million  the amount of the prior year s write down 
the balance of the million decrease was principally due to research and development expenses related to the non recurring engineering contracts that provided revenue 
as a result  these costs were recognized in cost of sales 

table of contents selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million or to million  or of net sales  for fiscal from million  or of net sales  for fiscal the increase was principally driven by salary and relocation expenses for new hires including our new president 
interest income expense  net 
net interest income decreased million to million in fiscal as compared to net interest income of million in fiscal net interest income for fiscal was lower because of lower interest rates in the year 
income tax 
income tax expense was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the million income tax increase was the result of a higher profit before tax and a smaller research and development tax credit in fiscal as compared to fiscal net income 
as a result of the factors described above  net income increased million or to million  or of net sales in fiscal from million  or of net sales in fiscal on a fully diluted basis  earnings per share eps increased or to during fiscal from in fiscal fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september net sales 
net sales decreased million or to million for the fiscal year ended september  from million for the fiscal year ended september  the decrease was primarily attributable to reduced shipments on the kc program as a result of completing all required deliveries in the first half of fiscal sales on this program totaled million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year this represented a decline in year over year sales of million 
approximately one half of this decline was offset with new customer sales 
cost of sales 
cost of sales decreased million or to million  or of net sales  for fiscal from million  or of net sales  for fiscal the decline in the dollar amount was essentially due to lower sales and the decline as a percent of net sales was primarily related to cost containment efforts 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased million  or  to million  or of net sales  for fiscal from million  or of net sales  for fiscal the increase in both dollar amount and percent of sales was due to expensing million of certification cost in fiscal year that was incurred in prior periods and carried as an intangible asset supporting flat panel certification on the pilatus airplane 
the decision to change our initial launch aircraft from a pilatus pc to a boeing necessitated recognizing this change at this time 
research and development spending in fiscal year  excluding the million  declined by million or and amounted to million or of net sales 
the decrease in dollars was due to lower contract labor cost on selected development programs 
the increase as a percent of sales was due to lower sales on a year over year basis 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million  less than  to million  or of net sales  for fiscal from million  or of net sales  for fiscal this spending level reflects our effort to control costs 
the increase as a percent of sales was due to a sales decline in fiscal interest income expense  net 
net interest income decreased million to million in fiscal as compared to net interest income of million in fiscal net interest income for fiscal was lower because of lower interest rates in the year 
income tax 
income tax expense was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the million decrease in income tax was the result of three factors reduced profit before tax yielded a million income tax reduction  recording a million research and development tax credit reduced taxes by a like amount and reducing the state effective tax rate from to contributed million of the reduction

the fees paid were comparable with the fees paid prior to the law firm s investment in the company 
the company derived net sales of  and  for the years ended september   and  respectively from an entity which is a shareholder  and purchased  and  of component parts used in the manufacturing process from this related party during such years 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity have been cash flows from operations  proceeds from our initial public offering ipo  and borrowings 
we require cash principally to finance inventory  payroll and accounts receivable 
our cash flow provided from operating activities was million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the decrease in year over year cash flow was primarily the result of prior year reductions in inventory and accounts receivable that were not repeated in fiscal cash flow provided by operating activities was million in fiscal as compared to million in cash provided in fiscal the increase in year over year cash flow was mainly due to improvements in inventory  accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued expenses  partially offset with lower net income 
our cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal as compared to million used in fiscal the year over year decrease in investing activities primarily relates to our new building being completed in fiscal consequently  spending stopped in that year 
our cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal as compared to million used in fiscal the increase in investing activities was principally related to changes in restricted cash associated with the industrial development bond that financed  in part  our new building 
actual purchases of property  plant and equipment declined on a year over year basis 
our cash used by financing activities in fiscal was million as opposed to cash used in fiscal of million 
the use of cash in both periods principally relates to the open market re purchase of our stock 
the stock re purchase is being treated as treasury stock and the amount purchased in fiscal was  shares at an aggregate price of million 
in fiscal the company purchased  shares at an aggregate price of million 
we allowed our credit facility to lapse in august as a result of the strong cash balance we have from the net proceeds of our ipo 
we are in discussions with a number of financial institutions regarding the establishment of a new credit facility 
to accommodate our future growth  we purchased and acres of land in the eagleview corporate park  exton  pennsylvania 
there we constructed a  square foot facility that is expandable to  square feet which was completed in october both the land and building cost approximate million 
of this amount  million was funded through an industrial development bond idb and the remainder from cash from operations 

table of contents our future capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including market acceptance of our products  the timing and rate of expansion of our business  acquisitions  joint ventures and other factors 
we have experienced increases in our expenditures since our inception consistent with growth in our operations  personnel  and product line and we anticipate that our expenditures will continue to increase in the foreseeable future 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents  together with net proceeds from any new credit facility we may enter into  will provide sufficient capital to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months 
however  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private financing or other arrangements in order to support more rapid expansion of our business than we currently anticipate 
further  we may develop and introduce new or enhanced products  respond to competitive pressures  invest in or acquire businesses or technologies or respond to unanticipated requirements or developments

however  we cannot predict the future effects of inflation 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the company s most critical accounting policies are revenue recognition  income taxes  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation and warranty reserves 
the company recognizes sales for products when the following revenue recognition criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  product delivery and acceptance has occurred  pricing is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
the company recognizes sales upon shipment of products to customers 
sales related to certain long term contracts requiring development and delivery of products over several years are accounted for under the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts and the amounts are not significant for fiscal the company offers its customers extended warranties for additional fees 
these warranty sales are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as sales on a straight line basis over the warranty period 

table of contents the company enters into certain sales arrangements that include multiple deliverables as defined in emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
effective july   the company identifies all goods and or services that are to be delivered separately under a sales arrangement and allocates revenue to each deliverable based on fair value that is established with the customer during contract negotiations 
in general  revenues are separated between product sales and non recurring engineering services 
the allocated revenue for each deliverable is then recognized using appropriate revenue recognition methods 
income taxes are recorded in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
provisions for federal and state income taxes are calculated on reported financial statement pre tax income based on current tax law 
the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the company s assets and liabilities and expected benefits of utilizing net operating loss carry forwards 
the impact on deferred taxes of changes in tax rates and laws  if any  applied to the years during which temporary differences are expected to be settled  are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period of enactment 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
these allowances are determined by analyzing historical data and trends 
if actual losses are greater than estimated amounts or if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  future results from operations could be adversely affected 
inventories are written down for estimated obsolescence equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
we offer warranties on some products of various lengths 
at the time of shipment  we establish a reserve for the estimated cost of warranties based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims using historical data on products sold as of the balance sheet date 
the length of the warranty period  the product s failure rates and the customer s usage affects warranty cost 
if the actual cost of warranties differs from our estimated amounts  future results of operations could be adversely affected

business segments the company operates in one principal business segment which designs  manufactures and sells flight information computers  large flat panel displays and advanced monitoring systems to the department of defense  government agencies  commercial air transport carriers and corporate general aviation markets 
the company currently derives virtually all of its revenues from the sale of this equipment 
almost all of the company s sales  operating results and identifiable assets are in the united states 
risk factors risks related to our business most of our sales are of air data systems products  and we cannot be certain that the market will continue to accept these or our other products 

table of contents during fiscal and  we derived and  respectively  of our revenues from the sale of air data systems and related products 
we expect that revenues from our air data products will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues in the future 
accordingly  our revenues will decrease if such products do not continue to receive market acceptance or if our existing customers do not continue to incorporate our products in their retrofitting or manufacturing of aircraft 
in seeking new customers  it may be difficult for our products to displace competing air data products 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that potential customers will accept our products or that existing customers will not abandon them 
a substantial portion of our sales has been  and we expect will continue to be  to prime contractors or government agencies in connection with government aircraft retrofit or original manufacturing contracts 
sales to government contractors and government agencies accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our revenues during fiscal  and accordingly  our revenues could decline as a result of commercial  general aviation or dod spending cuts and general budgetary constraints 
in addition  our revenues are concentrated with a limited number of customers 
we derived of our revenues during fiscal year from five customers  bombardier  dhl  garrett  northwest airlines  and the dod and of our revenues during fiscal year from five customers  dme inc  first air  raytheon  rockwell collins and dod 
we expect a relatively small number of customers to account for a majority of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
as a result of our concentrated customer base  a loss of one or more of these customers could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
during fiscal and  and of our revenues resulted from sales in connection with the united states air force kc retrofit program in which we are a supplier of certain avionics products 
this program was completed in fiscal and  with the exception of spare parts  repairs and upgrades  no additional sales are expected in future periods 
the growth of our customer base could be limited by delays or difficulties in completing the development and introduction of our planned products or product enhancements 
if we fail to enhance existing products or to develop and achieve market acceptance for flat panel displays and other new products that meet customer requirements  our business may not grow 
although a substantial majority of our revenues has come from sales of air data systems and related products  we expect to spend a large portion of our research and development efforts in developing and marketing our large flat panel display systems cip and complementary products 
our ability to grow and diversify our operations through the introduction and sale of new products  such as large flat panel displays  is dependent upon our success in continuing product development and engineering activities as well as our sales and marketing efforts and our ability to obtain requisite approvals to sell such products 
our sales growth will also depend in part on the market acceptance of and demand for our cip and future products 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to develop  introduce or market our cip or other new products or product enhancements in a timely or cost effective manner or that any new products will receive market acceptance or necessary regulatory approval 
we rely on third party suppliers for the components of our air data systems products  and any interruption in the supply of these components could hinder our ability to deliver our products 
our manufacturing process consists primarily of assembling components purchased from our supply chain 
these suppliers may not continue to be available to us 
if we are unable to maintain relationships with key third party suppliers  the development and distribution of our products could be delayed until equivalent components can be obtained and integrated into our products 
in addition  substitution of certain components from other manufacturers may require faa or other approval  which could delay our ability to ship products 
as a result of these uncertainties  we invested in surface mount technology in fiscal that will lessen our dependence on outside suppliers for these critical components 
our government retrofit projects are generally pursuant to either a direct contract with a government agency or a subcontract with the general contractor to a government agency 
each contract includes various federal 
table of contents regulations that impose certain requirements on us  including the ability of the government agency or general contractor to alter the price  quantity or delivery schedule of our products 
in addition  the government agency or general contractor retains the right to terminate the contract at any time at its convenience 
upon alteration or termination of these contracts  we would normally be entitled to an equitable adjustment to the contract price so that we may receive the purchase price for items we have delivered and reimbursement for allowable costs we have incurred 
most of our backlog is from government related contracts 
accordingly  because these contracts can be terminated  we cannot assure you that our backlog will result in sales 
we depend on our key personnel to manage our business effectively  and if we are unable to retain our key employees  our ability to compete could be harmed 
our success depends on the efforts  abilities and expertise of our senior management and other key personnel  including in particular our chairman and chief executive officer  geoffrey s 
m 
hedrick 
we generally do not have employment agreements with our employees 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain such employees  the loss of some of whom could hurt our ability to execute our business strategy 
we intend to continue hiring key management and sales and marketing personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  and we may not be able to attract or retain additional qualified personnel 
we do not maintain key man life insurance for mr 
hedrick or other executive officers 
our future success will depend in part on our ability to implement and improve our operational  administrative and financial systems and controls and to manage  train and expand our employee base 
we cannot assure you that our current and planned personnel levels  systems  procedures and controls will be adequate to support our future operations 
if inadequate  we may not be able to exploit existing and potential market opportunities 
any delays or difficulties we encounter could impair our ability to attract new customers or enhance our relationships with existing customers 
our revenue and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter  which may cause our stock price to decline 
our revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  including demand for our products  timing of the introduction of rvsm requirements on various flight routes  capital expenditure budgets of aircraft owners and operators and the appropriation cycles of the us government  changes in the use of our products  including non rvsm air data systems  rvsm systems and flat panel displays  delays in introducing or obtaining government approval for new products  new product introductions by competitors  changes in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors  and costs related to possible acquisitions of technologies or businesses 
we plan to increase our operating expenses to expand our sales and marketing operations and fund greater levels of product development 
as a result  a delay in generating revenues could cause significant variations in our operating results from quarter to quarter 
our competition includes other manufacturers of air data systems and flight information displays against whom we may not be able to compete successfully 

table of contents the markets for our products are intensely competitive and subject to rapid technological change 
our competitors include kollsman  inc  honeywell international inc  rockwell collins inc  smiths industries plc and meggitt avionics inc substantially all of our competitors have significantly greater financial  technical and human resources than we do 
in addition  our competitors have much greater experience in and resources for marketing their products 
as a result  our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and customer preferences or devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than we can 
our competitors may also have greater name recognition and more extensive customer bases that they can use to their benefit 
this competition could result in price reductions  fewer customer orders  reduced gross margins and loss of market share 
we may not be able to identify or complete acquisitions or we may consummate an acquisition that adversely affects our operating results 
one of our strategies is to acquire businesses or technologies that will complement our existing operations 
we have limited experience in acquiring businesses or technologies 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to acquire or profitably manage acquisitions or successfully integrate them into our operations 
furthermore  certain risks are inherent in our acquisition strategy  such as the diversion of management s time and attention and combining disparate company cultures and facilities 
acquisitions may have an adverse effect on our operating results  particularly in quarters immediately following the consummation of such transactions  as we integrate the operations of the acquired businesses into our operations 
once integrated  acquisitions may not achieve levels of net sales or profitability comparable to those achieved by our existing operations or otherwise perform as expected 
our success depends on our ability to protect our proprietary rights  and there is a risk of infringement 
if we are unable to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights  we may be unable to compete effectively 
our success and ability to compete will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent or other protection for our technology and products  both in the united states and abroad 
in addition  we must operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others 
we currently hold nine us patents and have eight us patent applications pending 
in addition  we have three international patents and twenty two international patent applications pending 
we cannot be certain that patents will be issued on any of our present or future applications 
in addition  our existing patents or any future patents may not adequately protect our technology if they are not broad enough  are successfully challenged or other entities are able to develop competing methods without violating our patents 
if we are not successful in protecting our intellectual property  competitors could begin to offer products that incorporate our technology 
patent protection involves complex legal and factual questions and  therefore  is highly uncertain  and litigation relating to intellectual property is often very time consuming and expensive 
if a successful claim of patent infringement were made against us or we are unable to develop non infringing technology or license the infringed or similar technology on a timely and cost effective basis  we might not be able to make some of our products 
risks related to our industry if we are unable to respond to rapid technological change  our products could become obsolete and our reputation could suffer 
future generations of air data systems  engine and fuel displays and flat panel displays embodying new technologies or new industry standards could render our products obsolete 
the market for aviation products is subject to rapid technological change  new product introductions  changes in customer preferences and evolving industry standards 
our future success will depend on our ability to adapt to rapidly changing technologies  adapt our products to evolving industry standards  and 
table of contents develop and introduce a variety of new products and product enhancements to address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers 
our future success will also depend on our developing high quality  cost effective products and enhancements to our products that satisfy the needs of our customers and on our introducing these new technologies to the marketplace in a timely manner 
if we fail to modify or improve our products in response to evolving industry standards  our products could rapidly become obsolete 
our products are currently subject to direct regulation by the us federal aviation administration faa  its european counterpart  the joint aviation authorities jaa  and other comparable organizations 
our products  as they relate to aircraft applications  must be approved by the faa  jaa or other comparable organizations before they can be used in an aircraft 
to be certified  we must demonstrate that our products are accurate and able to maintain certain levels of repeatability over time 
although the certification requirements of the faa and the jaa are substantially similar  there is no formal reciprocity between the two systems 
accordingly  even though some of our products are faa approved  we may need to obtain approval from the jaa or other appropriate organizations to have them certified for installation outside the united states 
significant delay in receiving certification for newly developed products or enhancements to our products or losing certification for our existing products could result in lost sales or delays in sales 
furthermore  the adoption of additional regulations or product standards  as well as changes to the existing product standards  could require us to change our products and underlying technology 
some products from which we expect to generate significant future revenues  including our cip  have not received regulatory approval 
we cannot assure you that we will receive regulatory approval on a timely basis or at all 
for a more detailed description  see business government regulation 
because our products utilize sophisticated technology and are deployed in complex aircraft cockpit environments  problems with these products may arise that could seriously harm our reputation for quality assurance and our business 
our products use complex system designs and components that may contain errors  omissions or defects  particularly when we incorporate new technologies into our products or we release new versions or enhancements of our products 
despite our quality assurance process  errors  omissions or defects could occur in our current products  in new products or in new versions or enhancements of existing products after commercial shipment has begun 
we may be required to redesign or recall those products or pay damages 
such an event could result in the following the delay or loss of revenues  the cancellation of customer contracts  the diversion of development resources  damage to our reputation  increased service and warranty costs  or litigation costs 
although we currently carry product liability insurance  this insurance may not be adequate to cover our losses in the event of a product liability claim 
moreover  we may not be able to maintain such insurance in the future 
we face risks associated with the continuing depressed commercial aviation market for products 
we face risks associated with international operations that could cause our financial results to suffer or make it difficult to market our products outside of the united states 

table of contents we expect to derive an increasing amount of our revenues from sales outside the united states  particularly in europe 
we have limited experience in marketing and distributing our products internationally 
in addition  there are certain risks inherent in doing business on an international basis  such as differing regulatory requirements for products being installed in aircraft  legal uncertainty regarding liability  tariffs  trade barriers and other regulatory barriers  political and economic instability  changes in diplomatic and trade relationships  potentially adverse tax consequences  the impact of recessions in economies outside the united states  and variance and unexpected changes in local laws and regulations 
currently  all of our international sales are denominated in us dollars 
an increase in the value of the dollar compared to other currencies could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
in the future  we may conduct sales in local currencies  exposing us to changes in exchange rates that could adversely affect our operating results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s operations are exposed to market risks primarily as a result of changes in interest rates 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to its cash equivalents and an industrial revenue bond 
the company s cash equivalents consist of funds invested in money market accounts  which bear interest at a variable rate  while the industrial revenue bond carries an interest rate that is consistent with day tax exempt commercial paper 
as the interest rates are variable  a change in interest rates earned on the cash equivalents or paid on the industrial revenue bond  would impact interest income and expense along with cash flows  but would not impact the fair market value of the related underlying instruments
