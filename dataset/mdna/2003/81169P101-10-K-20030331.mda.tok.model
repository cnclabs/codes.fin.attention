item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and historical results of operations should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
in august  the company restated its consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december  the restatement was made in order to accrue an additional million operating expense in the fourth quarter of related to supplemental marine insurance calls 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to bad debts  useful lives of vessels and equipment  deferred tax assets  and certain accrued liabilities 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
revenue is generally recorded when services are rendered  the company has a signed charter agreement or other evidence of an arrangement  pricing is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
for the majority of the offshore energy and towing segments  revenues are recorded on a daily basis as services are rendered 
for the marine transportation segment  revenues are earned under time charters or affreightment voyage contracts 
revenue from time charters is earned and recognized on a daily basis 
certain time charters contain performance provisions  which provide for decreased fees based upon actual performance against established targets such as speed and fuel consumption 
revenue for affreightment voyage contracts is recognized based upon the percentage of voyage completion 
the percentage of voyage completion is based on the number of voyage days worked at the balance sheet date divided by the total number of days expected on the voyage 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the estimate of uncollectible amounts is based on the results of ongoing credit evaluations and the company s historical experience 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
asset impairment 
the company records impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when indications of impairment are present and the estimated undiscounted cash flows to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amounts 
if the carrying value is not recoverable  the carrying value of the assets is reduced to estimated fair value 
undiscounted cash flows are estimated using expected average long term day rates and utilization based largely on historical industry and company experiences 
if future market conditions do not meet expectations  the company may be required to record impairment charges which could be material 
useful life determination 
management determines the useful lives of the vessels and equipment based upon regulatory requirements such as opa  market conditions and operational considerations 
the company continues to evaluate the reasonableness of the useful lives of the vessels and equipment 
drydocking costs 
substantially all of the company s vessels must be periodically drydocked and pass certain inspections to maintain their operating classification  as mandated by certain maritime regulations 
costs incurred to drydock the vessels are deferred and amortized on a straight line basis over the period to the next drydocking  generally to months 
the alternative accounting policy for drydocking costs is to expense the expenditures as incurred 
the financial accounting standards board and the american institute of certified public accountants have proposed that the deferral method of accounting for planned major maintenance activities such as drydocking expenditures should be eliminated 
under the proposal  the company would expense drydocking expenditures as incurred 
the unamortized drydocking costs were approximately million at december  valuation of deferred tax assets 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
after application of the valuation allowance  the company s net deferred tax assets and liabilities are zero at december  and stock based compensation as permitted by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  the company accounts for employee stock based compensation in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
apb 
under apb  compensation expense is calculated at the time of option grant based upon the difference between the exercise prices of the option and the fair market value of the company s common stock at the date of grant recognized over the vesting period 
the company had no stock based compensation during  and revenue overview the company derives its revenue from three main lines of business seabulk offshore  seabulk tankers  and seabulk towing 
seabulk offshore  the company s domestic and international offshore energy support business  accounted for approximately and of company revenue in and  respectively 
marine transportation under the new name  seabulk tankers  consists of the company s jones act tanker business  in which it operates ten petroleum product and chemical carriers in the us coastwise trade  and its inland tug and barge operation and shipyard  sun state marine services 
sun state s tug and barge assets were sold in march  and the shipyard assets were sold in july together  they accounted for approximately and of company revenue in and  respectively 
seabulk towing  the company s domestic harbor and offshore towing business  accounted for approximately and of the company s and revenue  respectively 
seabulk offshore revenue from the company s offshore energy support operations is primarily a function of the size of the company s fleet  vessel day rates or charter rates  and fleet utilization 
rates and utilization are primarily a function of offshore exploration  development  and production activities  which are in turn heavily dependent upon the price of crude oil and natural gas 
further  in certain areas where the company conducts offshore energy support operations particularly the us gulf of mexico  contracts for the utilization of offshore energy support vessels commonly include termination provisions with three to five day notice requirements and no termination penalty 
as a result  companies engaged in offshore energy support operations including the company are particularly sensitive to changes in market demand 
as the company s offshore energy support fleet gets older  the company s strategy is to look for opportunities to upgrade its offshore fleet to higher value  newer vessels and to reduce the number of older and smaller crewboats in its fleet 
the company sold offshore energy support vessels during for an aggregate total of million and a gain of approximately  periods for collection of receivables in certain foreign areas of operation in the offshore business tend to be longer than is usual for the united states 
the company regularly monitors all such receivables accounts and believes that it has accrued adequate reserves where necessary 
the following table represents revenue for seabulk offshore by major operating area as of december in thousands year ended december  domestic    west africa    middle east    southeast asia    total    domestic consists of vessels operating in the united states  the gulf of mexico  mexico  the caribbean  and south america 
the following tables set forth  by primary area of operation  average day rates achieved by the offshore energy fleet owned or operated by the company and average utilization for the periods indicated 
average day rates are calculated by dividing total revenue by the number of days worked 
utilization percentages are based upon the number of working days over a day year and the number of vessels in the fleet on the last day of the quarter

domestic revenue for was adversely affected by the slowdown in natural gas drilling activity in the us gulf of mexico as a result of somewhat lower natural gas prices and high inventories 
the lower level of natural gas prices resulted from above average inventory buildups and reduced demand due to one of the mildest winters on record in and a general slowdown in economic activity 
exploration and production companies in the us gulf of mexico responded by cutting back their level of spending as evidenced by the significant drop in offshore rig fleet utilization rates during the last half of calendar year and in although there is still uncertainty in the market  the rise in both crude oil and natural gas prices that began in the fourth quarter of  driven by concern over a potential middle east conflict  the temporary shutoff of iraqi and venezuelan imports  dwindling inventories of both crude oil and natural gas as the winter of turned out to be much colder than expected  and other factors  should eventually aid a recovery in the gulf of mexico offshore vessel market 
as the demand for vessels in the domestic market is primarily driven by natural gas exploration and production  it is difficult to predict what effect the current high level of natural gas prices and the uncertainty in the economic environment will have on demand for the company s vessels in the domestic market 
in the meantime  the company is exploring charter opportunities in mexico which remains a healthy market 
as noted earlier  however  we anticipate an eventual upturn in offshore drilling activity and hence in the demand for our vessels 
the outbreak of war in iraq in march is a further complicating factor  although it is not expected to have a material impact on the company s operations 
depending on the length of the conflict  the cessation of hostilities is expected to produce a measure of moderation and stability in commodity prices and may eventually lead to the opening of the iraqi market to us companies 
international offshore revenues for benefited from increases in vessel count and utilization 
in west africa  the demand for vessels  and hence utilization  remained strong as this is an oil driven market with longer time horizons and increasing exploration and production budgets primarily from oil company majors 
the company redeployed five vessels to its west african operations during international vessel demand is primarily driven by crude oil production 
during the fourth quarter crude oil prices and demand remained firm 
the company expects international exploration and production spending to continue to increase in west africa  which should strengthen vessel demand in that area 
revenue and utilization were also up for the company s middle east operations 
in southeast asia  revenue remained substantially the same as the year earlier period 
average day rates and utilization for the company s anchor handling tug supply vessels and supply boats at march  for domestic  west africa  the middle east and southeast asia were approximately    and  respectively 
the company had five offshore vessels in held for sale status as of december  the majority of these vessels were previously laid up 
subsequent to december   the company sold three crewboats in the held for sale category 
seabulk tankers revenue from the company s marine transportation services is derived principally from the operations of tankers carrying crude oil  petroleum products and chemical products in the jones act trade and  to a lesser extent  from the sun state towboat and fuel barge operations in green cove springs  florida  which were sold in march the company s tanker fleet operates on either long term time charters  bareboat charters  or pursuant to contracts of affreightment 
the company currently has six tankers operating under long term charters  three on contracts of affreightment and one under a bareboat charter 
the following table sets forth the number of vessels and revenue for the company s petroleum and chemical product carriers year ended december  number of vessels owned at end of period 
revenue in thousands    during  the company scrapped one tanker that was at the end of its opa mandated useful life and terminated a charter in contract for another tanker 
tanker revenue increased by in as a result of improved rates for the company s three chemical carriers operating under contracts of affreightment  as well as higher rates on the long term time charters 
petroleum tankers 
demand for crude oil and petroleum product transportation services is dependent both on production and refining levels as well as on consumer and commercial consumption of petroleum products and chemicals 
the company owned eight petroleum product tankers at december  five of these are double hull  state of the art vessels  of which two have chemical carrying capability 
at the end of december  voyage charters for three vessels expired and were replaced by two multi year time charters at time charter equivalent rates above the returns achieved for these vessels in for the third vessel  the company entered into a ten year bareboat charter agreement with a major oil company 
beginning in january  the oil company charterer has exclusive possession and control of the vessel and is responsible for all operating and drydocking expenses of the vessel 
the company also entered into a time charter securing a fourth vessel  in the fourth quarter of at a increase over the expiring rate 
in the third quarter of  a vessel previously trading under a voyage charter entered into a three year time charter with a major oil company  and two of our existing time charters were extended through july  under a time charter  fuel and port charges are borne by the charterer customer and are therefore not reflected in the charter rates 
consequently  both the revenue and cost side of time charter vessels are reduced by the amount of the fuel and port charges 
our jones act fleet is benefiting from a tightening domestic tanker market  which should see a further strengthening as opa forces out older  single hull vessels 
none of our single hull vessels is scheduled for retirement under opa before chemical tankers 
demand for industrial chemical transportation services generally coincides with overall economic activity 
the company operated two chemical tankers and one of the five double hull vessels in the chemical trade as of december  the chemical tankers are double bottom ships 
the higher day rate environment for petroleum tankers is carrying over into the chemical tanker market as charterers look for quality tonnage to replace older single hull vessels 
inland tugs and barges 
revenue from the company s sun state marine services subsidiary was derived primarily from contracts of affreightment with colonial oil industries formerly known as steuart petroleum co 
and florida power light fpl and from ship maintenance  repair  drydocking and construction activities 
revenue from all of sun state s operations totaled and million  respectively  for the year ended december  and the decrease in sun state revenue is due to the sale of its marine transportation tug and barge assets in march in july  the company also closed on the sale of drydock and related shipyard equipment of sun state for  resulting in a gain of approximately  seabulk towing revenue derived from the company s tug operations is primarily a function of the number of tugs available to provide services  the rates charged for their services  the volume of vessel traffic requiring docking and other ship assist services and competition 
vessel traffic  in turn  is largely a function of the general trade activity in the region served by the port 
the following table summarizes certain operating information for the company s tugs 
year ended december  number of tugs at end of period towing revenue in thousands    towing revenue decreased to million in from million in primarily due to reduced vessel traffic in certain of the company s ports reflecting the slowdown in international trade  increased competition  and reduced demand for towing services in the offshore market 
the company has been the sole provider of docking services in port canaveral  the smallest of its harbor towing markets 
as a result of the recent proceeding before the federal maritime commission  the company may soon have a competitor in port canaveral 
overview of operating expenses and capital expenditures the company s operating expenses are primarily a function of fleet size and utilization 
the most significant expense categories are crew payroll and benefits  depreciation and amortization  fuel  maintenance and repairs  and insurance 
during periods of decreased demand for vessels  the company temporarily ceases using certain vessels  ie  lays up vessels  to reduce expenses for marine operating supplies  crew payroll and maintenance 
at december   seven of the company s offshore energy support vessels were laid up or held for sale 
the crews of company manned chemical and product tankers are paid on a time for time basis under which they receive paid leave in proportion to time served aboard a vessel 
the crews of offshore energy support vessels and certain tugs and towboats are paid only for days worked 
the company provides for depreciation on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets 
opa mandates the useful life of the company s product and chemical carriers  except for the five double hull carriers 
the company overhauls main engines and key auxiliary equipment in accordance with a continuous planned maintenance program 
under applicable regulations  the company s chemical and product carriers and offshore service vessels and its four largest tugs are required to be drydocked twice in each five year period for inspection and routine maintenance and repairs 
these vessels are also required to undergo special surveys every five years involving comprehensive inspection and corrective measures to insure their structural integrity and the proper functioning of their cargo and ballast tanks and piping systems  critical machinery and equipment  and coatings 
the company s harbor tugs generally are not required to be drydocked on a specific schedule 
during the years ended december   and  the company drydocked  and vessels  respectively  at an aggregate cost exclusive of lost revenue of million  million and million  respectively 
the company accounts for its drydocking costs under the deferral method  under which capitalized drydocking costs are expensed over the period preceding the next scheduled drydocking 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company had capital expenditures  including drydocking costs  in the years ended december   and of million  million and million  respectively 
the cost of fuel is an item which has significant impact on the company s operating results 
its cost was relatively stable in  but has risen considerably during the first quarter of during fuel and consumables costs represented approximately of operating costs 
insurance costs consist primarily of premiums paid for i protection and indemnity insurance for the company s marine liability risks  which are insured by a mutual insurance association of which the company is a member and through the commercial insurance markets  ii hull and machinery insurance and other maritime related insurance  which are provided through the commercial marine insurance markets  and iii general liability and other traditional insurance  which is provided through the commercial insurance markets 
insurance costs  particularly costs of marine insurance  are directly related to overall insurance market conditions and industry and individual loss records  which vary from year to year 
the increase in p i costs due to higher deductibles and higher self insured retention levels will likely cause an increase in p i insurance expense in of between million and million 
premiums by both marine and non marine insurers have been adversely impacted by the erosion of claims reserves including our underwriters  claims underwriting losses and increased reinsurance costs  as well as our own loss experience 
no assurance can be given that affordable and viable direct and reinsurance markets will be available to us in the future 
we maintain high levels of self insurance for p i and hull and machinery risks through the use of substantial deductibles and self insured retentions which may increase in the future 
we carry coverage related to loss of earnings on revenues subject to fourteen day deductibles  for our tanker operations  but not for our offshore and tug operations 
insurance costs represented approximately of operating costs in results of operations the following table sets forth certain selected financial data and percentages of net revenue for the periods indicated year ended december  dollars in millions revenue operating expenses overhead expenses depreciation  amortization  drydocking and other income from operations interest expense  net other income expense  net net loss before income taxes and extraordinary item net loss compared with revenue 
revenue decreased to million for from million for due to decreased revenue from the company s offshore energy support segment 
offshore energy support revenue decreased to million for from million for the same period in  primarily due to reduced revenue from the us gulf of mexico 
this was offset in part by higher revenue from the west africa operating region 
revenue from the us gulf of mexico decreased during compared to the same period in primarily due to reduced exploration and production activity in response to average natural gas prices  high inventories and reduced demand for energy 
the increase in west africa revenue was driven by higher day rates and an expanded vessel count as offshore exploration and production activity remained strong 
the company took advantage of the expanding west africa market by mobilizing three of its gulf of mexico supply boats and one southeast asia utility boat for redeployment to west africa and reactivating one anchor handling tug from held for sale status to active status in west africa during the first half of marine transportation revenue remained substantially the same at million for as compared to million for tanker revenue increased by as a result of improved rates for the company s three chemical carriers operating under contracts of affreightments  as well as better rates on long term time charters 
this was offset by a decrease in revenue for sun state as a result of discontinuing operations in march towing revenue decreased by to million for from million for the decrease in revenue was due to reduced vessel traffic in certain of the company s ports  reflecting the slowdown in international trade  as well as reduced demand for towing services in the offshore market 
operating expenses 
operating expenses decreased to million from million for primarily due to the change from voyage charters to time charters for two tankers  the bareboat charter of a third tanker  and the sale of sun state s marine transportation assets in the first quarter 
since two tankers were changed from voyage charters to time charters in  fuel and port charges significantly decreased as these expenses are the responsibility of the charterer under time charters 
under a bareboat contract  the charterer is responsible for crewing and operating the vessel 
operating expenses for were also adversely affected by a million charge reflecting current and anticipated investment losses sustained by the company s protection and indemnity marine insurance club 
overhead expenses 
overhead expenses increased to million in as compared to million for the same period in the increase was primarily due to an increase in insurance expenses as a result of purchasing a million d o policy for the departing board members due to the recapitalization in september other overhead also increased due to higher bad debt reserve in our west african operations 
as a percentage of revenue  overhead expenses increased to for compared to for the same period in depreciation  amortization  drydocking and other expenses 
depreciation  amortization  drydocking and other expenses increased to million for from million for  primarily due to higher planned drydocking expenditures for offshore energy support vessels and tankers during the second half of and in as a result  drydock amortization expense is also higher as drydock costs are amortized on a straight line basis over the period to the next drydocking generally months 
net interest expense 
net interest expense decreased to million for from million for the same period in the decrease was primarily due to the combination of lower interest rates on variable rate debt and lower outstanding debt balances under our term loans and revolving credit facility 
interest expense also decreased as a result of the recapitalization in september see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the interest rate on the new credit facility is substantially less than the rate on the company s senior notes  which were redeemed on october  in november  the interest rate under the new credit facility was increased by basis points in accordance with the terms of the commitment letter with the lending banks to syndicate the new credit facility by november  other income  net 
other income  net increased to million in compared to other expense of million in this increase in other income is primarily due to a gain on asset sales in of million 
compared with revenue 
revenue increased to million for from million for primarily due to increased revenue from the company s offshore energy support segment offset in part by decreased revenue from the company s marine transportation segment 
offshore energy support revenue increased to million for from million for primarily due to the significant increases in day rates for both supply and crew boats in the gulf of mexico and west africa operating regions offset in part by decreased revenue from the middle east region 
additionally  the company purchased two crewboats in december and may and placed those vessels into service in the gulf of mexico 
during the first eight months of  day rates and utilization for all vessels working in the gulf of mexico rose due to increased exploration and production activities 
during the last four months of  day rates and utilization for the company s gulf of mexico based vessels decreased as drilling activity fell sharply on the heels of lower natural gas prices and reduced energy demand 
nevertheless  the strong first half of fiscal resulted in a significant increase in full year revenue for the gulf of mexico operating region 
in the west africa operating region  average day rates rose across all vessel classes and utilization remained strong throughout as the market continued to expand in what is primarily an oil driven  deepwater business 
the company mobilized two of its gulf of mexico based supply boats for redeployment to west africa during the first quarter of the decline in middle east revenue in is attributable to fewer vessels average of vessels in compared to vessels in as the company sold a significant number of underperforming vessels that were working in the middle east region in and the reduction in the number of vessels working in the middle east is a direct result of the lack of profitability stemming from production cutbacks by the organization of petroleum exporting countries 
during  a total of offshore energy support vessels were sold  most of which were based in the middle east 
marine transportation services revenue decreased million  or  to million for from million for this decrease was primarily due to the mandated retirement of one of the company s jones act tankers in the third quarter of and the termination of the company s chartering in of one tanker in the first quarter of through october total revenue relating to the two additional tankers amounted to million 
the decrease from the two tankers was offset in part by increased transportation activity with tankers working under various voyage contracts 
towing revenue increased to million in from in primarily due to increased port activity during the fourth quarter of operating expenses 
operating expenses decreased to million from million for primarily due to the lease termination and retirement of two tankers and the change of three tankers from spot trading to time charters in the company s marine transportation services operations 
this decrease was offset in part by higher crew salaries and benefits and consumables and supplies expenses in offshore energy support operations 
total operating expenses primarily charter hire  fuel and port charges relating to the two tankers noted above amounted to million 
since three tankers were changed from spot trading to time charters in  fuel and port charges significantly decreased as these expenses are the responsibility of the charterer under time charters 
operating expenses for were also adversely affected by a million charge reflecting current and anticipated investment losses sustained by the company s protection and indemnity marine insurance club 
the increase in offshore crew salaries and benefits was primarily due to additional maritime staff resulting from purchase of two crewboats in december and may  termination of a bareboat out contract for two crewboats and increased utilization of vessels in the gulf of mexico and west africa 
under a bareboat contract  the charterer is responsible for crewing and operating the vessel 
additionally  expenses for consumables and supplies increased in the west africa operating region due to increased operating activity 
in november  the company entered into a three year e procurement contract with an outside vendor 
the contract consolidated the purchasing activity of the company s three segments into one common platform and standard 
additionally  the contract included spare parts and consumable data base rationalization to reduce on board and warehouse inventory and procurement costs  automated tendering to increase competitive quoting  sourcing enhancements to increase the number of qualified suppliers quoting  automated contract management to increase utilization of pre negotiated contracts  and automated supplier connectivity via the internet to reduce transaction cost and time 
management expects that the contract will be a significant step toward our ongoing efforts to further reduce various operating costs such as supplies and consumables  and maintenance and repair 
however  management cannot estimate the amount of the savings at this time 
overhead expenses 
overhead expenses decreased to million in from million for primarily due to a decrease in professional fees and other overhead expenses offset in part by increases in salaries and benefits 
higher headcount and related salary expense for corporate activity resulted in savings on third party consulting fees and services 
the decrease in other overhead expenses is primarily due to lower charges for rent and other miscellaneous items as a result of the elimination of non essential services and consolidation of administrative functions 
depreciation  amortization  drydocking and other expenses 
depreciation  amortization  drydocking and other expenses increased to million in from million in primarily due to higher planned drydocking expenditures for offshore energy support vessels and tankers and the write down of the book value of vessels and equipment and deferred drydocking costs of sun state marine services  inc drydocking amortization expense increased to million in from million in in response to increased activity in the offshore energy support segment in  the company increased the level of drydocking expenditures 
additionally  the company had to drydock five tankers in tanker drydocking expenditures are generally higher than expenditures for offshore vessels and tugs 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  management decided to sell the fixed assets mostly tug barges of sun state marine services  inc the sale of the tug and barge assets was consummated in march the shipyard assets were sold in july upon reclassifying sun state s assets to assets held for sale  management considered recent appraisals  offers and bids and its estimate of future cash flows related to the fixed assets 
as a result  the company recorded a write down of million 
income from operations 
income from operations increased to million in compared to million in as a result of higher day rates in the company s offshore energy support business and lower operating and overhead expenses 
net interest expense 
net interest expense decreased to million in from million in primarily due to lower interest rates on variable rate debt and lower outstanding balances under our term loans and revolving credit facility 
the eurodollar rate for the term loans and revolving line of credit decreased from at december  to at december  the decline in the eurodollar rate resulted from the series of interest rate cuts by the federal reserve and the general slowdown of the global economy during this decrease was offset in part by interest expense on additional borrowings in for the remaining interest in the five double hull tankers and the purchase of two crewboats financed through borrowings under the company s revolving line of credit 
other income expense 
other expense totaled million in compared to other income of million in the decrease in other income was primarily due to a net loss of million on vessel sales in compared to a net gain of million on vessel sales and a million favorable settlement of a disputed liability in net loss 
the company s net loss decreased to million in from million for as a result of higher revenue and lower operating and interest expenses 
the provision for income taxes increased from million in to million in primarily due to higher foreign revenue 
as of december  and  management believes that it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would not be realized 
therefore  a full valuation allowance is recorded reducing the net deferred tax assets to zero 
liquidity and capital resources at december   the company had working capital of approximately million 
day rates and utilization for offshore vessels working in the gulf of mexico continued to be weak  a trend that began in september the slowdown in the domestic offshore market was offset in part by continued strength in the company s international offshore operations  where day rates remained strong during the year and contributed to increased revenue in west africa and the middle east  and in part by the improved performance of the marine transportation segment 
the increased revenue in the offshore business in west africa and the middle east was driven by exploration and production spending as major oil companies continued to proceed with oil exploration and development programs outside the us since the september  attacks  the subsequent war on terrorism and then commencement of the war in iraq  the us economy continues to be subject to pressure 
as we enter  the timing of a recovery in the domestic offshore segment is still not certain 
however  the increases in oil and natural gas prices during the fourth quarter of and the early part of reinforce the potential for an upturn in domestic exploration and development activity in the latter half of we do expect earnings in from the offshore segment to improve compared to the company also expects to benefit in from higher earnings in its marine transportation business as a result of a full year of higher time charter rates for certain tankers 
the company s capital requirements arise primarily from its need to service debt  fund working capital and maintain and improve its vessels 
the company anticipates capital requirements for debt service  vessel maintenance and fleet improvements in to total approximately million and expects that cash flow from operations will continue to be a significant source of funds for its working capital and capital requirements 
the company s credit agreement contains certain restrictive financial covenants that among other things requires minimum levels of ebitda and tangible net worth 
the company is in compliance with such covenants at december  and expects to be in compliance through the balance of based on current financial projections 
however  the company s financial projections contain assumptions with respect to economic recovery beginning in the second quarter of in the underperforming us gulf offshore market 
if the economic recovery does not occur or occurs later or to a lesser extent than the current forecast  the company will need to reduce operating expenses to maintain compliance 
management continues implementation of certain initiatives in an effort to improve profitability and liquidity 
these initiatives include selective acquisitions and charters of additional vessels  repositioning certain vessels to take advantage of higher day rates  selling unprofitable vessels  and eliminating non essential operating and overhead expenses 
management believes that its expense reduction initiatives will be sufficient to meet its financial covenants if the forecasted us gulf is other than expected 
management recognizes that unforeseen events or business conditions  including unexpected deterioration in its markets  could prevent the company from having sufficient liquidity to fund its operation or meeting targeted financial covenants 
if unforeseen events or business conditions prevent the company from having sufficient liquidity to fund its operations  the company has alternative sources including additional asset sales  and deferral of capital expenditures  which should enable it to satisfy essential capital requirements 
if the company does not meet its financial covenants  the company would be required to seek an amendment or waiver to avoid default 
while the company believes it could successfully implement alternative plans  if necessary  there can be no assurance that such alternatives would be available or that the company would be successful in their implementation
