critical accounting policies the company s accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item as disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events 
these estimates and assumptions affect amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the disclosure of gain and loss contingencies at the date of the consolidated financial statements 
the amounts currently estimated by the company are subject to change if different assumptions as to the outcome of future events were made 
the company evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and predicates those estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
management makes adjustments to its assumptions and judgments when facts and circumstances dictate 
since future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty  actual results may differ from the estimates used by the company in preparing the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
management of the company believes the following critical accounting policies encompass the more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenues 
revenues include sales of merchandise and services  net commissions earned from leased departments in the company s retail stores and shipping and handling revenues related to merchandise sold 
revenues from the company s retail operations are recognized at the later of the point of sale or the delivery of goods to the customer 
revenues from the company s direct marketing operation are recognized when the merchandise is delivered to the customer 
the company maintains reserves for anticipated sales returns primarily based on the company s historical trends related to returns by its retail and direct marketing customers 
merchandise inventories and cost of goods sold 
the company utilizes the retail method of accounting for substantially all of its merchandise inventories 
merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
the retail inventory method is widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality 
under the retail inventory method  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are determined by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio  for various groupings of similar items  to the retail value of inventories 
the cost of the inventory reflected on the consolidated balance sheet is decreased by charges to cost of sales at the time the retail value of the inventory is lowered through the use of markdowns 
hence  earnings are negatively impacted when merchandise is marked down 
the areas requiring significant management judgment related to the valuation of the company s inventories include setting the original retail value for the merchandise held for sale  recognizing merchandise for which the customer s perception of value has declined and appropriately marking the retail value of the merchandise down to the perceived value and estimating the shrinkage that has occurred between physical inventory counts 
these judgments and estimates  coupled with the averaging processes within the retail method can  under certain circumstances  produce varying financial results 
factors that can lead to different financial results include setting original retail values for merchandise held for sale incorrectly  failure to identify a decline in perceived value of inventories and process the appropriate retail value markdowns and overly optimistic or conservative shrinkage estimates 
the company believes it has the appropriate merchandise valuation and pricing controls in place to minimize the risk that its inventory values would be materially misstated 
consistent with industry business practice  the company receives allowances from certain of its vendors in support of the merchandise purchased by the company for resale 
certain allowances are received to reimburse the company for markdowns taken and or to support the gross margins earned by the company in connection with the sales of the vendor s merchandise 
these allowances are recognized as an increase to gross margin when the allowances are earned by the company and approved by the vendor 
other allowances received by the company represent reductions to the amounts paid by the company to acquire the merchandise 
these allowances reduce the cost of the acquired merchandise and are recognized as an increase to gross margin at the time the goods are sold 
income and expenses related to securitization 
pursuant to applicable accounting principles  the company s current credit card securitization program qualifies for sale treatment related to those receivables transferred to third party investors sold interests 
as a result  the company recognizes a gain or loss equal to the difference between the consideration received for the sold interests and the allocated cost basis of the receivables sold 
the portion of the credit card receivables that continue to be held by the company retained interests are shown as undivided interests in nmg credit card master trust on the company s consolidated balance sheets 
all income  net of related expenses  pertaining to both the sold interests and the retained interests are reflected as a reduction of selling  general and administrative expenses in the company s consolidated statements of earnings 
assumptions related to the future performance of the company s credit card portfolio have a significant impact on the calculation of the gain or loss on the sale of the sold interests  the carrying values of retained interests and the recognition of income on the retained interests 
determining the fair value of the sold and retained interests requires estimates related to the gross future finance charge collections to be generated by the total credit card portfolio  future finance charge collections allocable to the sold interests  future credit losses and discount rates 
items that were considered in making judgments and preparing estimates and factors that might lead to future variations in consolidated financial results in the event of differences between actual and estimated results are as follows finance charge income is billed at a contractual rate monthly and warrants little judgment or estimation 
the expected credit card customer payment rate is based on historical payment rates adjusted for recent payment rate trends 
to the extent credit card customers pay off their balances sooner than estimated  the income earned by the company may decrease 
conversely  should the credit card customers pay off balances over a longer period of time  the income earned by the company may increase 
the finance charge collections are estimated using the current portfolio yield experience and estimated short term interest rates over the estimated life of the receivables 
to the extent current portfolio yield experience decreases and short term interest rates increase beyond the estimates  the finance charge collections may be reduced 
credit losses expected from the portfolio are based on historical write off rates  adjusted for recent write off trends and management s outlook of future trends 
to the extent there are positive or negative factors affecting the credit card customers ability or intent to pay off the outstanding balance eg  level of discretionary income  level of consumer debt  bankruptcy legislation  the actual bad debts to be realized could exceed or be less than the amounts estimated 
credit losses in excess of those estimated reduce the income earned by the company 
conversely  credit losses less than those estimated increase the income earned by the company 
the assumed cash flow discount rates are based on prevailing market interest rates and management s estimate of an appropriate risk premium for each respective retained interest 
the actual discount rates used are subject to interest rate fluctuations 
the most sensitive assumptions in calculating the fair values are the credit card customers payment rate  the estimate for credit losses  relative interest spreads and the assumed cash flow discount rates 
assumptions related to the future performance of the company s credit card portfolio have a significant impact on the calculation of the gain or loss on the sale of the sold interests  the carrying values of the retained interests and the recognition of income on the retained interests 
long lived assets 
to the extent the company remodels or otherwise replaces or disposes of property and equipment prior to the end of their assigned depreciable lives  the company could realize a loss or gain on the disposition 
to the extent assets continue to be used beyond their assigned depreciable lives  no depreciation expense is incurred 
the company reassesses the depreciable lives in an effort to reduce the risk of significant losses or gains at disposition and utilization of assets with no depreciation charges 
the reassessment of depreciable lives involves utilizing historical remodel and disposition activity and forward looking capital expenditure plans 
recoverability of the carrying value of store assets is assessed annually and upon the occurrence of certain events eg  opening a new store near an existing store or announcing plans for a store closing 
the recoverability assessment requires judgment and estimates for future store generated cash flows 
the underlying estimates for cash flows include estimates for future sales  gross margin rates and store expenses and are based upon the stores past and expected future performance 
new stores may require two to five years to develop a customer base necessary to generate the cash flows of the company s more mature stores 
to the extent management s estimates for sales growth and gross margin improvement are not realized  future annual assessments could result in impairment charges 
recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets is assessed annually and upon the occurrence of certain events 
the recoverability assessment requires management to make judgments and estimates regarding the fair values 
the fair values are determined using estimated future cash flows  including growth assumptions for future sales  gross margin rates and other estimates 
to the extent that management s estimates are not realized  future assessments could result in impairment charges 
advertising and catalogue costs 
the company s direct response advertising relates primarily to the production  printing and distribution of catalogues 
these costs are amortized during the periods the expected revenues from such catalogues are expected to be generated  generally three to six months 
all other advertising costs  including costs incurred by the company s online operations related to website design and advertising  are expensed in the period incurred 
loyalty programs 
the company maintains customer loyalty programs in which customers receive points annually for qualifying purchases 
upon reaching certain levels  customers may redeem their points for gifts 
generally  points earned in a given year must be redeemed no later than ninety days subsequent to the end of the annual program period 
the company accrues the estimated costs of the anticipated redemptions of the points earned by its customers at the time of the initial customer purchase and charges such costs to selling  general and administrative expense 
the estimates of the costs associated with the loyalty programs require the company to make assumptions related to customer purchasing levels  redemption rates and costs of awards to be chosen by its customers 
pension plan 
the company sponsors a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan pension plan covering substantially all full time employees 
in calculating its pension obligations and related pension expense  the company makes various assumptions and estimates  after consulting with outside actuaries and advisors 
the annual determination of pension expense involves calculating the estimated total benefit ultimately payable to pension plan participants and allocates this cost to the periods in which services are expected to be rendered 
the company uses the projected unit credit method in recognizing pension liabilities 
the pension plan is valued annually as of the beginning of each fiscal year 
significant assumptions related to the calculation of the company s pension obligations include the discount rate used to calculate the actuarial present value of benefit obligations to be paid in the future  the expected long term rate of return on assets held by the pension plan and the average rate of compensation increase by pension plan participants 
these actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually based upon currently available information 
the assumed discount rate utilized is based  in part  upon the moody s aa corporate bond yield as of the measurement date 
the discount rate is utilized principally in calculating the actuarial present value of the company s pension obligation and net pension expense 
at august   the discount rate was percent 
to the extent the discount rate increases or decreases  the company s pension obligation is decreased or increased  accordingly 
the estimated effect of a percent decrease in the discount rate would increase the pension obligation by million and increase annual pension expense by million 
the assumed expected long term rate of return on assets is the weighted average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the pension obligation 
it is the company s current policy to invest the pension plan assets in equity securities approximately percent and in fixed income securities approximately percent 
the company periodically evaluates the allocation between investment categories of the assets held by the pension plan 
the expected average long term rate of return on assets is based principally on the counsel of the company s outside actuaries and advisors 
this rate is utilized primarily in calculating the expected return on plan assets component of the annual pension expense 
to the extent the actual rate of return on assets realized over the course of a year is greater than the assumed rate  that year s annual pension expense is not affected 
rather  this gain reduces future pension expense over a period of approximately to years 
to the extent the actual rate of return on assets is less than the assumed rate  that year s annual pension expense is likewise not affected 
rather  this loss increases pension expense over approximately to years 
during  the company utilized percent as the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
the assumed average rate of compensation increase is the average annual compensation increase expected over the remaining employment periods for the participating employees 
the company utilized a rate of percent for the periods beginning august  this rate is utilized principally in calculating the pension obligation and annual pension expense 
the estimated effect of a percent increase in the assumed rate of compensation increase would increase the pension obligation by million and increase annual pension expense by million 
the company had cumulative unrecognized expense for the pension plan of million at august  primarily related to the delayed recognition of differences between the company s actuarial assumptions and actual results  which has contributed to the million underfunded status of the pension plan at august  self insurance and other employee benefit reserves 
management uses estimates in the determination of the required accruals for general liability  workers compensation and health insurance as well as short term disability  supplemental executive retirement benefits and postretirement health care benefits 
these estimates are based upon an examination of historical trends  industry claims experience and  in certain cases  calculations performed by third party experts 
projected claims information may change in the future and may require management to revise these accruals 
income taxes 
the company is routinely under audit by federal  state or local authorities in the areas of income taxes 
these audits include questioning the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
in evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions  the company accrues charges for probable exposures 
based on its annual evaluations of tax positions  the company believes it has appropriately accrued for probable exposures 
to the extent the company were to prevail in matters for which accruals have been established or be required to pay amounts in excess of recorded reserves  the company s effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially impacted 
litigation 
the company is periodically involved in various legal actions arising in the normal course of business 
management is required to assess the probability of any adverse judgments as well as the potential range of any losses 
management determines the required accruals after a careful review of the facts of each significant legal action 
the company s accruals may change in the future due to new developments in these matters

gross margin 
gross margin was percent of revenues in compared to percent in the prior year period

markdowns decreased as a percentage of revenues by percent in compared to the prior year period 
the company incurred a lower level of markdowns in the first and second quarters of compared to the prior year periods as higher markdowns were required in the first and second quarters of in connection with additional and more aggressive promotional events necessary to clear inventories in response to declines in retail sales in however  markdowns increased as a percentage of revenues for the third quarter and fourth quarters of compared to the prior year period 
higher markdowns were necessary in both the third and fourth quarters of to reduce a build up of inventories in certain merchandise categories that occurred in the third quarter as a result of lower than anticipated sales
