gross profit contribution by the defense segment was  or 
the reduction of gross profit percentage was primarily due to the reduced prices demanded by housewares small appliance retailers and the inability to pass on the company s increased manufacturing costs for these goods 
it is not anticipated that product pricing will increase  and further decreases are possible 
the decision to outsource housewares small appliances see note n is expected to ultimately decrease manufacturing costs 
however  those decreases are not expected to be realized until at least  given the need to continue domestic production at reduced rates and hence reduced burden absorption during while the new sources tool  manufacture  and ship product

liquidity and capital resources cash provided by operating activities was  during compared to cash used of  in the comparable period in the prior year 
the principle factors behind the increased cash provided are the changes in the components of working capital listed in the statement of cash flows under the line  cash flows from operating activities 
it is expected that the remaining portions of raw material  work in process  and finished goods inventory  which were part of the manufactured lifo reserve  will be largely liquidated during as a result  most of the remaining  of lifo reserve associated with the manufactured lifo reserve will flow through earnings as a reduction in cost of sales in as these inventories are sold 
cash flows from investing activities were  principally flowing from the sale or maturity of marketable securities 
the company invested in new tooling for the housewares small appliance division and expanded facilities for the defense products division which accounted for the majority of the  expended for additions to property  plant  and equipment 
financing activity cash flows consisted of a dividend payment of  and the purchase of treasury stock of  as a result of the foregoing factors  cash and cash equivalents rose by  to  working capital increased by  to  at december  the company s current ratio was to at december   compared to to at the end of fiscal the increase in working capital is primarily due to the liquidation of a portion of the company s lifo inventory reserve 
the current year earnings more than offset the dividend paid  and the increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities were partially offset by reduced accounts receivable 
the company expects to continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities that align with its business segments and will make further acquisitions or capital investments in these segments if the appropriate return on investment is projected 
page of the company has substantial liquidity in the form of cash and marketable securities to meet all of its anticipated capital requirements  to make dividend payments  and to fund growth through acquisitions and other means 
the slow and steady declines in interest rate yield for tax exempt and other debt securities over the past several years has resulted in reduced levels of interest income for the company 
there can be no assurance when  or if  interest rate yields will return to more historically normal levels 
the company intends to continue its investment strategy of safety and relative near term liquidity throughout its investment holdings 
as a result of this strategy  interest rate yields are not expected to improve  and could continue to decline  during interest rate yields are a function of national and international monetary policies and the growth of us and world economies and are not controllable by the company 
as of december   there were no material capital commitments outstanding 
no major capital expansion projects are currently planned for in connection with the company s plant closing activity during  the company could incur additional losses upon the disposition of property  plant  and equipment associated with the operations being closed 
in addition  the company may have underestimated its plant closing costs that could result in additional expenses during the company is not aware of any such costs  however  plant closing activities of this nature are unique and infrequent for the company  therefore  these activities possess inherent risk that errors in the estimation process could occur 
subject to the foregoing estimation risk  no major plant closing related expenses are expected in new accounting pronouncements please refer to note a for information related to the future effect of adopting new accounting pronouncements on the company s consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s interest income on cash equivalents and marketable securities is affected by changes in interest rates in the united states 
cash equivalents include money market funds and day variable rate demand notes which are highly liquid instruments with interest rates set every days that can be tendered to the remarketer upon days notice for payment of principal and accrued interest amounts 
the day tender feature of these variable rate demand notes are further supported by an irrevocable letter of credit from highly rated us banks 
to the extent a bond is not remarketed at par plus accrued interest  the difference is drawn from the bank s letter of credit 
the company s investments are held primarily in fixed and variable rate municipal bonds with an average life of less than one year 
accordingly  changes in interest rates have not had a material affect on the company  and the company does not anticipate that future exposure to interest rate market risk will be material 
the company uses sensitivity analysis to determine its exposure to changes in interest rates 
the company has no history of  and does not anticipate in the future  investing in derivative financial instruments 
most transactions with international customers are entered into in us dollars  precluding the need for foreign currency cash flow hedges 
any transactions that are currently entered into for settlement in foreign currency are not deemed material to the financial statements
