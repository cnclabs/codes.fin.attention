item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition introduction this section includes historical information  certain forward looking information and the information provided below under the heading certain risks and uncertainties about certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our future operating results to differ materially from the results indicated by any forward looking statements made by us or others 
it is important that the business discussion in item of this report and the historical discussion below be read together with the discussion of risks and uncertainties  and that these discussions be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an on going basis  we make and evaluate estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  capitalized software development costs  in process research and development of acquired businesses  acquired technology  goodwill and intangible assets  deferred tax assets and marketable securities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about amounts and timing of revenues and expenses  the carrying values of assets and the recorded amounts of liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates and such estimates may change if the underlying conditions or assumptions change 
the critical accounting policies related to the estimates and judgments listed above are discussed further throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
historical information historical performance should not be viewed as indicative of future performance  as there can be no assurance that operating income loss or net earnings loss as a percentage of revenues will be sustained at these levels 
for a discussion of factors affecting operating margins  see the discussions below under the heading certain risks and uncertainties 
acquisitions in april  we acquired evity for million shares of common stock and cash of million 
stock options to purchase million common shares were issued to replace outstanding evity stock options 
in august  we acquired optisystems for cash of million 
in november  we acquired the assets of remedy from peregrine systems  inc peregrine for cash of million plus the assumption of certain liabilities of remedy 
in accordance with the purchase agreement  the cash purchase price was adjusted to million subsequent to march  in march  we acquired it masters for cash of million 
these transactions  along with various other immaterial technology acquisitions  were accounted for using the purchase accounting method and accordingly  the financial results for these entities have been included in our consolidated financial results since the applicable acquisition dates 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the fiscal years indicated  the percentages that selected items in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss bear to total revenues

we generally utilize written contracts as the means to establish the terms and conditions by which our products  support and services are sold to our customers 
we recognize revenue in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition and sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
these statements provide guidance on applying generally accepted accounting principles in recognizing revenue on software transactions 
in applying these statements  we recognize software license fees upon meeting the following four criteria execution of the signed contract  delivery of the underlying products to the customer and the acceptance of such products by the customer  determination that the software license fees are fixed or determinable  and determination that collection of the software license fees is probable 
in instances when any one of the four criteria is not met  we will either defer recognition of the software license revenue until the criteria are met or will recognize the software license revenue on a ratable basis  as required by sops and maintenance  enhancement and support revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement on a straight line basis 
revenues from license and maintenance transactions that are financed are generally recognized in the same manner as those requiring current payment 
we have an established business practice of offering installment contracts to customers and have a history of successfully enforcing original payment terms without making concessions 
further  the payment obligations are unrelated to product implementation or any other post transaction activity 
revenues from sales through agents  distributors and resellers are recorded either at the gross amount charged the customer or net of commissions payable  based on the economic risks and ongoing product support responsibilities we assume 
on occasion  we have purchased goods or services for our operations from customers at or about the same time that we licensed our software to these customers 
license revenues from such transactions represent less than one percent of our total license revenues in any period 
revenues from professional services are typically recognized as the services are performed for time and materials contracts  or on a percentage of completion basis 
our professional services revenues also include sales of third party software products which typically support our product lines 
these revenues are recorded net of amounts payable to the third party software vendors 
when several elements  including software licenses  maintenance  enhancement and support and professional services  are sold to a customer through a single contract  the revenues from such multiple element arrangements are allocated to each element based upon the residual method  whereby the fair value of the undelivered elements of the contract is deferred 
we have established vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for maintenance  enhancement and support and professional services 
accordingly  software license fees are recognized under the residual method for arrangements in which the software is licensed with maintenance  enhancement and support and or professional services  and where the maintenance  enhancement and support and or professional services are not essential to the functionality of the delivered software 
in those instances where professional services are essential to the functionality of the software  contract accounting is applied to both the software license and services elements of the arrangement 
in the event a contract contains terms which are inconsistent with our vendor specific objective evidence  all revenues from the contract are deferred until such evidence is established or are recognized on a ratable basis 
based on our interpretation of sop and sop  we believe that our current sales contract terms and business arrangements have been properly reported 
future interpretations of existing accounting standards or changes in our business practices could result in future changes in our revenue accounting policies that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
percentage change years ended march  compared to compared to in millions license north america international total license revenues maintenance north america international total maintenance revenues professional services north america international total professional services revenues total revenues    total revenues declined in fiscal continued absorption of prepaid capacity and difficult economic conditions in domestic and international markets throughout fiscal resulted in reduced information technology spending by many of our customers 
though the number of license transactions declined only during fiscal as compared to fiscal  tighter budgets and higher required approval levels caused many customers to enter into smaller transactions in terms of dollar value 
difficult economic conditions have persisted and information technology spending remains depressed 
we have experienced a decline in the size of transactions with our largest customers  which historically have accounted for a significant portion of our revenues 
as discussed in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  we acquired remedy in november excluding the impact of remedy revenues subsequent to the acquisition date  total revenues declined in fiscal primarily as a result of the economic conditions described above and reduced revenues for our patrol solutions during the first half of fiscal  as discussed below under product line revenues 
license revenue deferrals for fiscal were consistent with fiscal and therefore did not have an impact on the revenue change from year to year 
including remedy revenues subsequent to the acquisition date  total revenues increased 
product revenue growth was not materially impacted by inflation in fiscal and product license revenues our product license revenues primarily consist of fees related to products licensed to customers on a perpetual basis 
product license fees can be associated with a customer s licensing of a given software product for the first time or with a customer s purchase of the right to run a previously licensed product on additional computing capacity or by additional users 
in addition to perpetual based product license fees  our product license revenues also include  to a lesser extent  term license fees which are generated when customers are granted license rights to a given software product for a defined period of time 
for the year ended march   gross additions to deferred license revenue were million 
based on licensing trends and increased customer requests for contractual terms that result in deferral of revenue  we expect that our base of deferred license revenue will continue to grow in the near future 
the contract terms and conditions that result in deferral of revenue recognition for a given transaction result from arm s length negotiations between us and our customers 
during these negotiations  the contract terms and conditions that result in deferral may be requested by a customer  while in some cases we may suggest inclusion of these terms and conditions where it makes business sense to do so 
in either case  the resulting contract must be acceptable to both parties 
once it is determined that license revenue for a particular contract must be deferred  based on the contractual terms and application of revenue recognition policies to those terms  the company recognizes such license revenue either ratably over the term of the contract or when the revenue recognition criteria are met 
because of this  we generally know the timing of the subsequent recognition of license revenue at the time of deferral 
therefore  the amount of license revenue to be recognized out of the deferred revenue balance in each future quarter is predictable  and our total license revenues to be recognized each quarter become more predictable as a larger percentage of those revenues come from the deferred balance 
as of march  and  our total deferred license revenue balance was million and million  respectively 
our north american operations generated  and of total license revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
north american license revenues decreased from fiscal to fiscal and from fiscal to fiscal excluding the impact of remedy revenues subsequent to the acquisition date  north american license revenues declined in fiscal while license revenues were down across most product groups in fiscal and fiscal  the largest contributor to the revenue declines in both years was decreased license revenues for our mainframe data management products 
in fiscal  decreased patrol license revenues also had a significant impact 
international license revenues represented  and of total license revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
international license revenues decreased from fiscal to fiscal and increased from fiscal to fiscal while license revenues were down across most product groups from fiscal to fiscal  decreased license revenues for our mainframe data management products were the largest contributor to the revenue decline for the year 
excluding the impact of remedy revenues subsequent to the acquisition date  international license revenues declined in fiscal increases in license revenue for our mainframe data management and mainview products were more than offset by declines for our patrol  distributed systems data management and scheduling and output management products 
the international license revenue decline for fiscal included a decrease of and the decline in fiscal was net of an increase of due to foreign currency exchange rate changes during the periods  after giving effect to our foreign currency hedging program 
maintenance  enhancement and support revenues maintenance  enhancement and support revenues represent the ratable recognition of fees to enroll licensed products in our software maintenance  enhancement and support program 
maintenance  enhancement and support enrollment generally entitles customers to product enhancements  technical support services and ongoing compatibility with third party operating systems  database management systems  networks  storage systems and applications 
excluding remedy  these fees are generally charged annually and such fees have equaled to of the discounted price of the product prior to the program change in the fourth quarter of fiscal discussed below  and have equaled subsequent to the program change 
in addition  customers may be entitled to reduced maintenance percentages for entering into long term maintenance contracts that include prepayment of the maintenance fees or that are supported by a formal financing arrangement 
maintenance revenues also include the ratable recognition of the bundled fees for any initial maintenance services covered by the related perpetual license agreement 
remedy s maintenance fees are generally charged annually and equal to of the list price of the product 
in addition  customers may be entitled to reduced maintenance percentages on remedy products for entering into long term maintenance contracts that include prepayment of the maintenance fees 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we revised our maintenance program to a single maintenance offering of x support at a standard rate of of the discounted price of the associated product 
in connection with this revision  we have extended our standard warranty and initial support period to one year for all our products  whereas prior to this revision such periods were days for distributed systems products and one year for mainframe products 
because our maintenance revenues include the ratable recognition of the bundled fees for any initial maintenance services covered by the related perpetual license agreement  in certain new license transactions the extension of the initial support period for distributed systems products will cause us to recognize more maintenance revenues over time and less license revenues when the transactions occur 
while this change in our maintenance program will not have a material effect on our total revenues over time  there has been a negative short term revenue impact 
as discussed above  this maintenance program does not apply to remedy products 
maintenance revenues increased in both fiscal and primarily as a result of the continuing growth in the base of installed products and the processing capacity on which they run and the additional maintenance revenue associated with remedy 
excluding the impact of remedy revenues subsequent to the acquisition date  maintenance revenues increased in fiscal maintenance fees increase in proportion to the aggregate processing capacity on which the products are installed  consequently  we receive higher absolute maintenance fees as customers install our products on additional processing capacity 
due to the increased discounting for higher levels of additional processing capacity  the maintenance fees on a per unit of capacity basis are typically reduced in enterprise license agreements 
these discounts  combined with the reduced maintenance percentages for long term contracts discussed above and the recent decline in our license revenues  have led to lower growth rates for our maintenance revenue excluding remedy 
further declines in our license revenue and or increased discounting could lead to declines in our maintenance revenues excluding remedy 
historically  our maintenance renewal rates have been high  but economic pressures could cause customers to reduce their licensed capacity and therefore the capacity upon which our maintenance  enhancement and support fees are charged 
we expect remedy maintenance revenues to increase over the next fiscal year 
as required by purchase accounting for the acquisition  the remedy deferred maintenance revenue at the acquisition date was written down to fair value  as defined by us generally accepted accounting principles 
as such  the amounts recognized as maintenance revenue out of that acquisition date deferred revenue balance will reflect this write down 
the vast majority of the acquisition date deferred revenue will be recognized during the months following the acquisition 
all maintenance fees generated subsequent to the acquisition date will be deferred and recognized over the maintenance period at full contractual amounts 
product line revenues percentage change years ended march  compared to compared to in millions enterprise data management mainframe data management distributed systems data management enterprise systems management patrol mainview scheduling output management other software high potential product lines other software remedy nm nm total license maintenance revenues    we market software solutions designed to improve the availability  performance and recoverability of enterprise applications  databases and other it systems components operating in mainframe  distributed computing and internet environments 
our recent acquisition of remedy extends our solutions to include products that automate service related business processes through a complete suite of service management applications 
in fiscal  our solutions were broadly divided into three core business units and a fourth business unit geared towards solution areas in markets that appear to offer high growth opportunities 
the enterprise data management group includes products designed for managing database management systems on mainframe and distributed computing platforms 
the enterprise systems management group includes our systems management and monitoring  scheduling and output management solutions 
the remedy group includes our service management solutions 
the high potential product lines encompass storage management  security management  enterprise applications management  subscription services and linux management 
we evaluate our investments in these product lines on an ongoing basis and increase or decrease such investments as necessary  based on our expectations of the products future growth 
our enterprise data management solutions combined represented  and of total software revenues for fiscal  and  respectively 
total software revenues for this group declined from fiscal to fiscal and from fiscal to fiscal because this product group includes a high proportion of mainframe solutions  the continued absorption of prepaid capacity and the external market factors discussed above were the primary cause of the decline in license revenues in fiscal  more than offsetting an increase in maintenance revenue for that year 
in fiscal  the economic conditions discussed above caused both license and maintenance revenues for our mainframe data management products to decline  more than offsetting an increase in maintenance revenue for our distributed systems data management products 
the maintenance revenue decline was primarily a result of lower discounted prices and slowing capacity growth  which was not sufficient to offset these reduced prices 
our enterprise systems management solutions combined contributed  and of total software revenues for fiscal  and  respectively 
total software revenues for this group declined from fiscal to fiscal and from fiscal to fiscal in fiscal  license revenue decreases for this product group  due to the economic factors discussed above  more than offset maintenance revenue increases 
license revenues decreased in fiscal primarily due to the continued weakness in it spending and a reduction in unix shipments from hardware manufacturers 
these external factors  coupled with delays in customer purchase decisions resulting from delays in our release of significant enhancements to components of the patrol product line during the first half of the year  had a direct negative impact on patrol license revenues  more than offsetting license revenue increases for the mainview and scheduling output management product lines and maintenance revenue increases for the patrol and scheduling output management solutions 
the remaining key patrol enhancements were delivered at the end of the third quarter of fiscal though patrol license revenues were down for the second half of the year compared to the same period in fiscal  such revenues for the third and fourth quarters increased sequentially over the immediately preceding quarters 
these increases were due  in part  to sales from the newly introduced agentless monitoring product  patrol express r 
our high potential product lines contributed  and of total software revenues for fiscal  and  respectively 
total software revenues for this group increased from fiscal to fiscal and from fiscal to fiscal fiscal growth includes revenue increases across all product lines 
however  license revenue for our high potential products declined in fiscal we evaluate our investments in these product lines on an ongoing basis and will increase or decrease such investments as necessary  based on our expectations of the products future growth 
as of april   we have decided from an organizational perspective to eliminate the high potential product lines as standalone units and to combine the storage management  enterprise application management  subscription services and linux management product lines into the core enterprise systems management business unit 
the security product group will continue to operate as an independent business unit and currently has a dedicated sales force in north america 
we have also made changes related to the storage management product line  from a go to market perspective 
our mainframe storage management and storage device knowledge modules remain key components of our systems management solutions  however  we have decided to limit our future research and development investment in one product  patrol storage manager  to supporting the existing version of this product 
this decision is based on our focus on improving profit margins and allocating resources to more attractive opportunities 
revenues from our remedy products for the period from the acquisition date of november  through march   contributed of total software revenues for fiscal  including of total software revenues in our fourth fiscal quarter  its first full quarter of results after the acquisition  including the impact of the write down of the acquisition date deferred maintenance revenue discussed above 
professional services revenues professional services revenues  representing fees from implementation  integration and education services performed during the periods and sales of third party software products  represented  and of total revenues  respectively  for fiscal  and professional services revenues declined from fiscal to fiscal and from fiscal to fiscal excluding the impact of remedy revenues subsequent to the acquisition date  professional services revenues declined 
the declines in both years are the result of our decreased license revenues  as this results in less demand for our implementation and integration services 
our professional services headcount has decreased due to the lower license revenue levels 
expenses beginning in fiscal  we increased our focus on expense control to better align our cost structure with the realities of a more difficult revenue environment 
this initiative included headcount reductions across all divisions and geographies  office consolidations  elimination of certain product lines and reductions in discretionary spending on items such as travel  consulting fees and equipment 
we were able to reduce these costs significantly while maintaining our industry leading product quality  customer support and sales relationships 
this initiative has continued throughout fiscal and will continue into the future  as necessary

selling and marketing expenses decreased from fiscal to fiscal and from fiscal to fiscal excluding the impact of remedy expenses subsequent to the acquisition date  selling and marketing expenses declined 
personnel costs were the largest contributor to the expense declines in fiscal and as a result of headcount reductions during those years 
consulting fees and travel costs also declined in fiscal and advertising  marketing and travel costs decreased in fiscal research  development and support research  development and support expenses mainly comprise personnel costs related to software developers and development support personnel  including software programmers  testing and quality assurance personnel and writers of technical documentation such as product manuals and installation guides 
these expenses also include costs associated with the maintenance  enhancement and support of our products  computer hardware software costs and telecommunications expenses necessary to maintain our data processing center  royalties and the effect of software development cost capitalization and amortization 
research  development and support costs were reduced in all three fiscal years by amounts capitalized in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
we capitalize our software development costs when the projects under development reach technological feasibility as defined by sfas no 
 and amortize these costs over the products estimated economic lives  which historically have been five years 
as discussed below  we revised the estimated economic lives for certain of our software products as of january   such that the capitalized costs for the majority of our products will be amortized over an estimated life of three years 
total capitalized software development costs  net of amortization  at march   were million 
under sfas no 
 we evaluate our capitalized software costs at each balance sheet date to determine if the unamortized balance related to any given product exceeds the estimated net realizable value of that product 
any such excess is written off through accelerated amortization in the quarter it is identified 
determining net realizable value as defined by sfas no 
requires that we make estimates and use judgment in quantifying the appropriate amount to write off  if any 
actual amounts realized from the software products could differ from our estimates 
also  any future changes to our product portfolio could result in significant research  development and support expenses related to software asset write offs 
the following table summarizes the amounts capitalized and amortized during fiscal  and amortization for these periods includes amounts accelerated for certain software products that were not expected to generate sufficient future revenues to realize the carrying value of the assets 
years ended march  in millions software development and purchased software costs capitalized total amortization net increase decrease in research  development and support expenses accelerated amortization included in total amortization above as a result of the changes in market conditions and research and development headcount reductions during fiscal and fiscal  we focused more on our core and high potential growth businesses 
as part of this effort  we reviewed our product portfolio during fiscal and fiscal and discontinued certain products 
to the extent that there were any capitalized software development costs remaining on the balance sheet related to these products  we accelerated the amortization to write these balances off 
this was the primary reason for the increase in accelerated amortization in fiscal and as compared to fiscal the continued need to accelerate amortization to maintain our capitalized software costs at net realizable value  the results of the valuation performed for the remedy acquisition that indicated a three year life was appropriate for that acquired technology and changes in the average life cycles for certain of our software products caused us to evaluate the estimated economic lives for our internally developed software products 
as a result of this evaluation  we revised the estimated economic lives of certain products as of january   such that most products will be amortized over an estimated life of three years 
these changes in estimated economic lives resulted in an additional million of amortization expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and reduced basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended march  by per share 
research  development and support expenses increased from fiscal to fiscal primarily due to the net effect of software cost capitalization and amortization  including the accelerated amortization discussed above  and a million write off of prepaid royalties and other assets related to technology we no longer plan to utilize 
these additional expenses more than offset reduced headcount costs  travel costs and consulting fees during the period 
research  development and support expenses increased from fiscal to fiscal excluding the impact of remedy expenses subsequent to the acquisition date  research  development and support expenses decreased primarily as a result of reductions in personnel  professional fees and royalty costs which more than offset the net effect of software cost capitalization and amortization detailed above 
during fiscal  we also wrote off software assets totaling million associated with certain business information integration products that were discontinued during the year as a result of the dissolution of that business unit as part of our restructuring plan 
this charge is included in restructuring costs in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income loss for fiscal and is discussed further below under the heading restructuring costs 
cost of professional services cost of professional services consists primarily of personnel costs associated with implementation  integration and education services that we perform for our customers  and the related infrastructure to support this business 
cost of professional services decreased from fiscal to fiscal and from fiscal to fiscal excluding the impact of remedy expenses subsequent to the acquisition date  cost of professional services declined 
the declines in both years resulted primarily from headcount reductions during these periods as a result of the declines in professional services revenues 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses are comprised primarily of compensation and personnel costs within executive management  finance and accounting  facilities management and human resources 
other costs included in general and administrative expenses are fees paid for legal and accounting services  consulting projects  insurance  costs of managing our foreign currency exposure and bad debt expense 
the decline in general and administrative expenses in fiscal was primarily related to decreased personnel costs  travel costs and bad debt expense 
general and administrative expenses declined from fiscal to fiscal excluding the impact of remedy expenses subsequent to the acquisition date  general and administrative expenses decreased primarily as a result of reduced bad debt expense  legal fees and shipping costs  which more than offset increases in personnel  insurance and travel costs 
acquired research and development in executing our product strategies  we employ both internal research and development and the acquisition of emerging technologies and established software companies 
we believe that time to market is critical to our success in the rapidly evolving distributed systems software market  where we must compete with a variety of software vendors  and where our products must integrate with the predominant database management systems  operating systems  network protocols and applications within the enterprise computing environment 
accordingly  we must continuously evaluate whether it is more efficient and effective to develop a given solution internally or acquire a technology that must be completed and then integrated into our existing product architecture 
the acquired technology companies are often small software companies with minimal to no revenues  quality and documentation standards and name recognition in the marketplace 
this strategy involves a high degree of risk and is costly in that a premium is typically paid for software code that is incomplete and only partially contributes to our overall development plans 
the following table presents information concerning the purchase price allocations for the acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method for fiscal  and acquired acquired goodwill total technology ipr d and other price in millions fiscal evity optisystems various immaterial acquisitions fiscal various immaterial acquisitions fiscal remedy it masters on april   we acquired all of the outstanding shares of evity in a transaction accounted for as a purchase 
the aggregate purchase price totaled million  including cash consideration of million  million shares of common stock  million common stock options and transaction costs  and was allocated as follows million to acquired technology  million to goodwill and other intangibles and million of the purchase price to purchased in process research and development ipr d 
net tangible assets acquired were insignificant 
the amount allocated to purchased ipr d represents the estimated fair value  based on risk adjusted cash flows  related to evity s research and development projects not yet completed 
at the date of acquisition  the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility  and the research and development in progress had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  these costs were expensed as of the acquisition date  during the quarter ended june  at the acquisition date  evity was conducting design  development  engineering and testing activities associated with the completion of siteangel  an enhanced version of evity s siteangel website performance monitoring product  as well as new technologies in the areas of load testing and network infrastructure 
the projects under development at the valuation date represented next generation technologies that were expected to address emerging market demands for the web performance market 
at the acquisition date  the technologies under development were approximately complete based on engineering man month data and technological progress 
evity had incurred nearly million on the in process projects and expected to spend approximately million to complete all phases of the research and development 
anticipated completion dates ranged from to months  at which times we expected to begin benefiting from the developed technologies 
we completed siteangel during fiscal and project costs were materially consistent with management s estimates at the acquisition date 
also during fiscal  the remaining projects in process at the acquisition date were suspended indefinitely 
on august   we acquired all of the outstanding shares of optisystems in a transaction accounted for as a purchase 
the aggregate purchase price totaled million in cash  including transaction costs  and was allocated as follows million to acquired technology  million to goodwill and other intangibles  million to equipment  receivables and other non software assets  net of liabilities assumed  and million of the purchase price to purchased in process research and development 
the amount allocated to purchased ipr d represents the estimated fair value  based on risk adjusted cash flows  related to optisystems incomplete research and development projects 
at the date of acquisition  the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility  and the research and development in progress had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  these costs were expensed as of the acquisition date  during the quarter ended september  at the acquisition date  optisystems was conducting design  development  engineering and testing activities associated with the completion of several components of its energizer r for r product 
the projects under development at the valuation date represented next generation technologies that were expected to address emerging market demands for the enterprise application performance market 
at the acquisition date  the technologies under development were approximately complete based on engineering man month data and technological progress 
optisystems had incurred approximately million on the in process projects  and expected to spend approximately million to complete all phases of the research and development 
anticipated completion dates ranged from to months  at which times we expected to begin benefiting from the developed technologies 
the projects have been completed and project costs were materially consistent with management s estimates at the acquisition date 
we completed other immaterial acquisitions during fiscal and which were accounted for under the purchase method as indicated in the table above 
on november   we acquired the assets of remedy from peregrine for million in cash plus the assumption of certain liabilities of remedy 
in accordance with the purchase agreement  the cash purchase price was adjusted to million subsequent to march  the aggregate purchase price was million  including the adjusted cash consideration and direct costs of the transaction 
the allocation of the purchase price to specific assets and liabilities was based  in part  upon outside appraisals of the fair value of certain assets of remedy 
the following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition 
november  in millions current assets property and equipment and other long term assets intangible assets goodwill total assets acquired current liabilities net assets acquired of the million of acquired intangible assets  we allocated million of the purchase price to in process research and development projects 
the amount allocated represents the estimated fair value  based on risk adjusted cash flows and historical costs expended  related to remedy s incomplete research and development projects 
at the date of acquisition  the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility  and the research and development in progress had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  these costs were expensed as of the acquisition date  during the quarter ended december  at the acquisition date  remedy was conducting design  development  engineering and testing activities associated with the completion of next generation core and application technologies that are expected to address emerging market demands in the service management market 
at the acquisition date  the technologies under development were approximately complete based on engineering man month data and technological progress 
remedy had incurred nearly million on the in process projects  and expected to spend approximately million to complete all phases of the research and development 
anticipated completion dates ranged from to months  at which times we expect to begin benefiting from the developed technologies 
on march   we acquired all of the outstanding shares of it masters in a transaction accounted for as a purchase 
the aggregate purchase price totaled million in cash  including transaction costs  and was allocated as follows million to acquired technology  million to goodwill and other intangibles  and million to liabilities assumed  net of tangible assets acquired 
at the acquisition date  there were no projects that had progressed to a degree that would enable the fair value of the in process research and development to be estimated with reasonable reliability and therefore no value was allocated to ipr d 
in making the purchase price allocations to ipr d  we considered present value calculations of income  analyses of project accomplishments and remaining outstanding items  assessments of overall contributions  as well as project risks 
the values assigned to purchased in process technology were determined by estimating the costs to develop the acquired technology into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from the projects  and discounting the net cash flows to their present value 
the revenue projections used to value the in process research and development were based on estimates of relevant market sizes and growth factors  expected trends in technology  and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by us and our competitors 
the resulting net cash flows from such projects are based on our estimates of cost of sales  operating expenses and income taxes from such projects 
in the present value calculations  aggregate revenues for the evity  optisystems and remedy developed  in process and future products were estimated to grow at compounded annual growth rates of approximately  and  respectively  for the five years following acquisition  assuming the successful completion and market acceptance of the major current and future research and development programs 
the estimated revenues for the in process projects were expected to peak within three years of acquisition and then decline sharply as other new products and technologies are expected to enter the market 
the rates utilized to discount the net cash flows to their present value were based on cost of capital calculations and venture capital rates of return 
due to the nature of the forecasts and risks associated with the projected growth and profitability of the developmental projects  discount rates of to were used to value the acquired ipr d for the various acquisitions during fiscal  and specifically  discount rates of  and to were used to value the acquired ipr d for evity  optisystems and remedy  respectively 
these discount rates were commensurate with the respective stage of development and the uncertainties in the economic estimates described above 
the assumptions used in valuing ipr d were based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur 
accordingly  actual results may differ from the projected results used to determine fair value 
the ipr d charge for fiscal also includes the write off of assets totaling million related to a technology agreement with envive corporation that was terminated during the first quarter of fiscal amortization and impairment of acquired technology  goodwill and intangibles under the purchase accounting method for certain of our acquisitions  portions of the purchase prices were allocated to goodwill  software and other intangible assets 
prior to april   we were amortizing all of these intangibles over three to five year periods  which reflected the estimated useful lives of the respective assets 
as of april   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
in accordance with this statement  goodwill and those intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized  but rather are tested for impairment annually and when events or circumstances indicate that their fair value has been reduced below carrying value 
acquired technology continues to be amortized under sfas no 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of our reported net earnings loss and earnings loss per share to those amounts that would have resulted had there been no amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for all periods presented 
we assigned our goodwill to the applicable reporting units and tested it for impairment upon adoption of sfas no 
as of april   and as of january  for the required annual testing 
the fair value of each of our reporting units with goodwill assigned exceeded the respective carrying value of the reporting unit s allocated net assets  including goodwill  and therefore no goodwill was considered impaired as of either date 
during fiscal  we performed an assessment of the carrying values of our acquired technology  goodwill and intangibles recorded in connection with various acquisitions 
the assessment was performed because sustained negative economic conditions impacted our operations and expected future revenues 
economic indicators at that time suggested that such conditions could continue for the foreseeable future 
as a result  we recorded impairment charges of million related to acquired technology to reflect these assets at their then current estimated net realizable values and million related to goodwill to reflect these assets at their then current estimated fair values 
these charges are reflected together with amortization expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss for fiscal  as amortization and impairment of acquired technology  goodwill and intangibles 
we evaluated our acquired technology under the provisions of sfas no 
 our other intangibles under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and of long lived assets to be disposed of  and our enterprise level goodwill under the provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 intangible assets 
the impairment charges for acquired technology reflect the amounts by which the carrying values exceeded the estimated net realizable values of the products 
the net realizable values for acquired technology were estimated as the future gross revenues from the products reduced by the estimated future costs of completing and disposing of the products  including the costs of performing maintenance and customer support required to satisfy our responsibilities set forth at the time of sale 
the impairment charges for goodwill reflect the amounts by which the carrying values exceeded the estimated fair values of these assets 
fair value was determined by discounting estimated future net cash flows related to these assets 
no impairment was identified for our other intangible assets 
impairment charges by asset category were as follows total acquired impairment technology goodwill charge in millions acquisition new dimension evity optisystems perform sa sa total we review the realizability of acquired technology  goodwill and intangibles on an ongoing basis  and when there is an indication of impairment  we perform the procedures under the applicable accounting pronouncements to quantify any impairment that exists 
determining the amount of impairment of these assets  if any  requires that we estimate future cash flows and make judgments regarding discount rates and other variables that impact the net realizable value or fair value of those assets  as applicable 
actual future cash flows and other assumed variables could differ from our estimates 
future impairment charges could be material 
restructuring costs during fiscal  we implemented a restructuring plan to better align our cost structure with existing market conditions 
this plan included the involuntary termination of  employees during the year 
these actions were across all divisions and geographies and the affected employees received cash severance packages 
during fiscal  we also discontinued certain business information integration products as a result of the dissolution of that business unit  and announced the closure of certain locations throughout the world 
a charge of million was recorded during fiscal for employee severance  the write off of software assets related to discontinued products  net of proceeds from the sale of a portion of the related technology  and office closures 
during fiscal  we sold our enterprise data propagation edp technology for a minority equity investment in the purchaser and future cash payments to be made based on the purchaser s quarterly sales to our former edp customers over the following four years 
as these products were part of the discontinued business information integration products  the proceeds will be recorded as a reduction of restructuring costs  as a recovery of the amount previously written off for these products 
for fiscal  proceeds of million were recorded  reflecting the estimated fair value of the equity investment received 
as the future cash payments  if any  cannot be estimated  they will be recorded in the periods received as a reduction of restructuring costs up to the amount previously written off 
any receipts in excess of the related asset write off will be reflected as other income 
as of march   million of severance and facilities costs related to actions completed under the restructuring plan remained accrued for payment in future periods  as follows balance at paid out or balance at march  charged to charged against march  expense related assets in millions severance and related expenses write off of software assets  net of proceeds received facilities costs total accrual the million credit to restructuring costs recorded during fiscal is primarily related to the net effect of adjustments to facilities and severance accruals initially recorded during fiscal as of march   substantially all disbursements related to the fiscal restructuring plan have been paid 
merger related costs and compensation charges during fiscal  and  we recorded merger related compensation charges of million  million and million  respectively 
these compensation charges are primarily related to the vesting of common stock issued as part of the evity acquisition to certain evity employee shareholders who we employed after the acquisition 
vesting was complete during the first quarter of fiscal also during fiscal and  million and million  respectively  of previously accrued merger costs related to the boole merger were reversed  as certain lease and severance obligations were satisfied at amounts below the amounts originally estimated 
these reversals are reflected as a reduction of merger related costs and compensation charges in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss for fiscal and other income  net other income  net consists primarily of interest earned on cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and finance receivables  gains and losses on marketable securities and other investments and interest expense on short term borrowings 
other income  net decreased from fiscal to fiscal and decreased from fiscal to fiscal other income for fiscal includes a million one time gain related to the sale of a financial instrument and a one time million gain related to a real estate transaction 
in fiscal  the decrease in other income  net primarily relates to the one time gains in the prior year discussed above  a million loss on a marketable security and million of impairment charges related to other equity investments 
these decreases were partially offset by lower interest expense as a result of our payment of all short term borrowings in the first quarter of fiscal in fiscal  the decrease in other income  net primarily relates to increased write downs of marketable securities as a result of fair value declines determined to be other than temporary totaling million 
fiscal other income  net also included million of impairment charges related to other equity investments 
income taxes we recorded income tax expense of million in fiscal  an income tax benefit of million in fiscal  and income tax expense of million in fiscal our effective tax rates were   and for fiscal  and  respectively 
the reduced effective tax rate in fiscal is a result of the impact of non deductible amortization expense in a year with a net pre tax loss 
for an analysis of the differences between the statutory and effective income tax rates  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
as previously disclosed in our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended december   we received a revenue agent s report rar from the internal revenue service irs for the tax years ended march  and the rar is not a statutory notice of deficiency  and we are protesting the findings in the rar 
the rar proposes tax increases resulting from adjustments to the transfer pricing arrangement we have with one of our foreign subsidiaries 
the irs claims in the rar that our us operations have not been adequately compensated by the foreign subsidiary for the right to distribute our technology in a specific territory 
the case has been transferred to the irs appeals division  and we are working with the irs appeals division to resolve the issues 
we believe that we have meritorious defenses to the proposed adjustments  and that adequate provisions for income taxes have been made  and therefore we believe that the ultimate resolution of the issues will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
recording income tax benefits results in the recognition of tax assets representing current tax refunds receivable from net operating loss carrybacks and or the future benefit of utilizing net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards to reduce future tax obligations 
we evaluate the deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards at each balance sheet date to determine their realizability  considering currently enacted tax laws 
if we determine that the assets are not fully realizable  a valuation allowance will be recorded to reduce the asset balances to their realizable values through a charge to income tax expense 
determining whether we will be able to utilize the net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards requires that we estimate future taxable income and make judgments regarding the timing of future tax obligations 
actual taxable income could differ from our estimates 
as of march   we believe it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize the tax asset related to net operating loss carryforwards and therefore no valuation allowance is recorded related to this asset 
if we conclude that this tax asset requires a valuation allowance in the future  the effect on income tax expense could be material 
as of march   we believe that it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset related to tax credit carryforwards will not be realized and therefore we have recorded a valuation allowance for this amount 
if we conclude that this tax asset requires an additional valuation allowance in the future  the effect on income tax expense could be material

this statement provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and requires prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
we have elected not to adopt the recognition and measurement provisions of sfas no 
and continue to account for our stock based employee compensation plans under accounting principles board apb opinion no

 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
fin 
fin requires the consolidation of entities in which an enterprise absorbs a majority of the entity s expected losses  receives a majority of the entity s expected residual returns  or both  as a result of ownership  contractual or other interests in the entity 
currently  entities are generally consolidated by an enterprise when it has a controlling financial interest through ownership of a majority voting interest in the entity 
we are in the process of evaluating the implications of fin to all variable interest entities with which we have involvement  but have determined that we will not be required to consolidate the conduit entities discussed under the heading liquidity and capital resources under fin because the arrangements do not result in us having variable interests in the conduit entities 
the consolidation requirements of fin apply to variable interest entities created after january  the consolidation requirements apply to older entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  we believe that adoption of fin will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations

acquired research and development amortization and impairment of acquired technology  goodwill and intangibles restructuring costs merger related costs and compensation charges operating income loss net earnings loss basic eps diluted eps shares used in computing basic eps 
shares used in computing diluted eps liquidity and capital resources at march   our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities were  million  a decrease of million from the march  balance 
as discussed in more detail below  this decline is primarily due to cash funding for the remedy and it masters acquisitions and treasury stock purchases which more than offset positive operating cash flow 
approximately two thirds of the  million of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities at march  is held in international locations and was largely generated from our international operations 
our international operations have generated million of earnings for which us income taxes have not been recorded 
these earnings would be subject to us income tax if repatriated to the united states 
the potential deferred tax liability for these earnings is approximately million  however  we have not provided a deferred tax liability on any portion of the million as we plan to utilize our cash in international locations for foreign investment purposes 
during fiscal  we utilized cash held in international locations to fund a portion of the remedy purchase price  based upon the valuation of the foreign assets of remedy acquired  and the it masters purchase price 
our working capital as of march   was million  reflecting a decrease from the march  balance of million due primarily to cash funding for the remedy and it masters acquisitions and treasury stock purchases which more than offset positive operating cash flow 
a significant dollar portion of our marketable securities is invested in securities with maturities beyond one year  and while typically yielding greater returns  investing in such securities reduces reported working capital 
our marketable securities are primarily investment grade and highly liquid 
because of current economic trends  we have begun investing in securities with shorter original maturities 
on december   we reclassified our held to maturity portfolio to the available for sale portfolio 
the amortized cost recorded on the balance sheet for the transferred securities was million at the date of reclassification 
when the securities were transferred to the available for sale portfolio  a net unrealized gain of million was recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
the transfer of securities from the held to maturity portfolio was made to increase our flexibility to react to the unprecedented volatility in the debt securities markets that developed over the quarters preceding the date of transfer 
stockholders equity as of march   was billion 
as discussed above  all of our marketable securities are classified as available for sale under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
changes in the fair values of these securities are reflected as unrealized gains and losses in stockholders equity and as a component of comprehensive income loss 
gains and losses on these securities are reflected in earnings either when realized through our sale of the securities or when a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary 
determining whether a value decline is other than temporary requires that we make judgments about expected future events 
actual future fair values could differ from our expectations 
we continue to finance our operations primarily through funds generated from operations 
for the year ended march   net cash provided by operating activities was million 
our primary source of cash is the sale of our software licenses  software maintenance and professional services 
we provide financing on a portion of these sales transactions to customers that meet our specified standards of creditworthiness 
our practice of providing financing at reasonable interest rates enhances our competitive position 
we participate in established programs with third party financial institutions to securitize or sell a significant portion of our finance receivables  enabling us to collect cash sooner and remove credit risk 
we utilize a consolidated financial subsidiary and various wholly owned  fully consolidated special purpose entities in these transfers 
we securitize finance receivables from customers with investment grade credit ratings through two special purpose entities sponsored by third party financial institutions 
the entities sponsored by third party financial institutions are multi seller conduits with access to commercial paper markets the conduit entities that purchase interests in similar receivables from numerous other companies unrelated to us 
in a securitization transaction  we sell a pool of finance receivables to a wholly owned special purpose entity 
this special purpose entity then sells a senior interest in the receivables at a discount to a conduit entity in exchange for cash 
though wholly owned and consolidated by us  the special purpose entity s assets are legally isolated from the company s general creditors and the conduit entity s investors have no recourse to our other assets for the failure of our customers to pay when due 
we have no ownership in either of the conduit entities and have no voting influence over the conduit entities operating and financial decisions 
as a result  we do not consolidate the conduit entities 
when we sell receivables in securitizations  we retain a beneficial interest in the securitized receivables  which is subordinate to the interests of the investors in the conduit entities 
the retained subordinate interests are measured and recorded at fair value based on the present value of future expected cash flows estimated using our best estimates of the key assumptions  including expected credit losses and discount rates commensurate with the risks involved 
we periodically review the key assumptions and estimates used in determining the fair value of the retained subordinate interests 
the value of our retained subordinate interests is subject to credit and interest rate risks on the transferred financial assets 
at march  and  the fair value of our retained subordinate interests was million and million  respectively  and is included in long term finance receivables in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
our maximum exposure to loss at march   as a result of our involvement with the conduit entities is limited to the carrying value of the retained subordinate interest 
other finance receivables are sold to third party financial institutions on a non recourse basis 
we record such transfers of beneficial interests in finance receivables to third party financial institutions as sales of such finance receivables when we have surrendered control of such receivables  including determining that such assets have been isolated beyond our reach and the reach of our creditors 
we have not guaranteed the transferred receivables and have no obligation upon default 
during the years ended march   and  we transferred million  million and million  respectively  of such receivables through these programs 
the high credit quality of our finance receivables and the existence of these third party facilities extend our ability to offer financing to qualifying customers on an ongoing basis without a negative cash flow impact 
recent shifts in various market factors have made the transfer of certain of our finance receivables more difficult and or less cost effective  including changes in the overall capacity of the market for such receivables  in customers credit quality  in the credit risk that third party financial institutions are willing to accept and in the documentation requirements of the third party financial institutions 
these factors may impact our ability to transfer finance receivables in the future 
beginning in the quarter ended december   the change in long term finance receivables has been reported as a component of cash flows from operating activities  whereas this was previously reported as a component of cash flows from investing activities 
all periods presented have been reclassified for consistency 
the change in long term finance receivables decreased net cash provided by operating activities by million in fiscal  and increased net cash provided by operating activities by million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended march  was million  primarily related to the remedy and it masters acquisitions  as discussed in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  partially offset by proceeds from maturities of marketable securities during the period 
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended march  was million  which primarily related to purchases of our common stock 
on april   our board of directors authorized the purchase of up to million in common stock  and on july   they authorized the purchase of an additional million 
during the year ended march   we purchased million shares for million 
from the inception of the repurchase plan through march   we have purchased million shares for million 
we plan to continue to buy our common stock and intend to purchase between million and million of common stock during fiscal  subject to market conditions and other possible uses of our cash 
we have no short term or long term debt outstanding 
our obligations for future minimum lease payments under non cancelable operating leases are million in fiscal  million in fiscal  million in fiscal  million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal and beyond 
we believe that our existing cash balances and funds generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future 
certain risks and uncertainties we operate in a dynamic and rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties 
the following section describes some  but not all  of these risks and uncertainties that we believe may adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we may experience a shortfall in revenue in any given quarter or may announce lower forecasted revenue or earnings  which could cause our stock price to decline 
our revenue is difficult to forecast and is likely to fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to many factors outside of our control 
in addition  a significant amount of our license transactions are completed during the final weeks and days of the quarter  and therefore we generally do not know whether revenues  earnings  cash flows and or changes to the deferred license revenue balances will have met expectations until the first few days of the following quarter 
any significant revenue shortfall or lowered forecasts could cause our stock price to decline substantially 
factors that could affect our financial results include  but are not limited to o the possibility that our customers may defer or limit purchases as a result of reduced information technology budgets  reduced data processing capacity demand or the current weak and uncertain economic and industry conditions  o the possibility that our customers may elect not to license our products for additional processing capacity until their actual processing capacity or expected future processing capacity exceeds the capacity they have already licensed from us  o the possibility that our customers may defer purchases of our products in anticipation of new products or product updates from us or our competitors  o the unpredictability of the timing and magnitude of our sales through direct sales channels  value added resellers and distributors  which tend to occur late in each quarter  o an unexpected increase in license transactions that require revenues to be deferred or recognized ratably over time rather than upfront  o the timing of new product introductions by us and the market acceptance of new products  which may be delayed as a result of weak and uncertain economic and industry conditions  o changes in our pricing and distribution terms or those of our competitors  and o the possibility that our business will be adversely affected as a result of the threat of significant external events that increase global economic uncertainty 
investors should not rely on the results of prior periods as an indication of our future performance 
our operating expense levels are based  in significant part  on our expectations of future revenue 
if we have a shortfall in revenue in any given quarter  we will not be able to reduce our operating expenses proportionally in response 
therefore  any significant shortfall in revenue will likely have an immediate adverse effect on our operating results for that quarter 
decreasing demand for enterprise license transactions could adversely affect revenues 
fees from enterprise license transactions have historically been a fundamental component of our revenues 
these revenues depend on our customers planning to grow their computer processing capacity and continuing to perceive an increasing need to use our existing software products on substantially greater processing capacity in future periods 
prior to  we licensed many of our larger customers to operate our mainframe products on significant levels of processing capacity in excess of their then current mainframe processing capacity 
during the past several years  we also entered into many enterprise license agreements with our larger customers to operate our distributed systems products on significant levels of processing capacity in excess of their then current distributed processing capacity 
in a weak economy  these customers may elect not to license our products for additional processing capacity until their actual processing capacity or expected future processing capacity exceeds the capacity they have already licensed from us 
if economic conditions weaken further  demand for data processing capacity could decline 
in addition  the uncertain economic environment has reduced customers expectations of future capacity growth  thus lessening demand for licensing excess processing capacity in anticipation of future growth 
in the past  customers tended to renew their enterprise license agreements prior to their expiration 
recent experience indicates that some customers renew early while other customers continue to operate under their existing capacity 
sustained sluggishness in it and capital spending can result in customers engaging in contract renewal discussions later than we anticipate 
these factors make it difficult to anticipate the size and timing of renewals of enterprise licenses 
if our customers who have entered into multi year capacity based licenses for excess processing capacity do not increase their processing capacity beyond the levels previously licensed from us or license additional processing capacity in anticipation of future growth  then our license revenues may not grow and our earnings could be adversely affected 
we may have difficulty achieving our cash flow from operations goal 
our quarterly cash flow is and has been volatile 
if our cash generated from operations proved in some future period to be materially less than the market expects  the market price of our common stock could decline 
factors that could adversely affect our cash flow from operations in the future include reduced net earnings  increased time required for the collection of accounts receivable  an increase in uncollectible accounts receivable  a significant shift from multi year committed contracts to short term contracts  a reduced ability to transfer finance receivables to third parties  reduced renewal rates for maintenance  and a reduced yield from marketable securities and cash and cash equivalents balances 
maintenance revenue could decline 
maintenance revenues have increased in each of the last three fiscal years as a result of the continuing growth in the base of installed products and the processing capacity on which they run 
maintenance fees increase as the processing capacity on which the products are installed increases  consequently  we receive higher absolute maintenance fees as customers install our products on additional processing capacity 
due to increased discounting for higher levels of additional processing capacity  the maintenance fees on a per unit of capacity basis are typically reduced in enterprise license agreements for our mainframe products 
in addition  customers may be entitled to reduced maintenance percentages for entering into long term maintenance contracts that include prepayment of the maintenance fees or that are supported by a formal financing arrangement 
these discounts  combined with reduced maintenance percentages for long term contracts and the recent decline in our license revenues  have led to lower growth rates for our maintenance revenue  excluding the impact of remedy revenues subsequent to the acquisition date 
further declines in our license revenue and or increased discounting would lead to declines in our maintenance revenues 
although renewal rates remain high  should customers migrate from their mainframe applications or find alternatives to our products  increased cancellations could lead to declines in our maintenance revenue 
our stock price is volatile 
our stock price has been and is highly volatile 
our stock price is highly influenced by current expectations of future revenue  earnings and cash flows 
any failure to meet anticipated revenue  earnings and cash flow levels in a period or any negative change in our perceived long term growth prospects would likely have a significant adverse effect on our stock price 
intense competition and pricing pressures could adversely affect our earnings 
the market for systems management software is highly competitive 
we compete with a variety of software vendors including ibm  hewlett packard hp  computer associates ca and a number of smaller software vendors 
we derived approximately half of our total revenues in fiscal from software products for ibm and ibm compatible mainframe computers 
ibm continues  directly and through third parties  to enhance and market its utilities for ims and db as lower cost alternatives to the solutions provided by us and other independent software vendors 
although such utilities are currently less functional than our solutions  ibm continues to invest in the ims and db utility market and appears to be committed to competing in these markets 
if ibm is successful with its efforts to achieve performance and functional equivalence with our ims  db and other products at a lower cost  our business would be materially adversely affected 
as a large hardware vendor and outsourcer of it services  ibm has the ability to bundle its other goods and services with its software and offer packaged solutions to customers which could result in increased pricing pressure 
to date  our solutions have competed well against ibm s because we have developed advanced automation and artificial intelligence features and our utilities have maintained a speed advantage 
in addition  we believe that because we provide enterprise management solutions across multiple platforms we are better positioned to provide customers with comprehensive management solutions for their complex multi vendor it environments than integrated hardware and software companies like ibm 
ca is also competing with us in these markets 
competition has led to increased pricing pressures within the mainframe systems software markets 
we continue to reduce the cost to our customers of our mainframe tools and utilities in response to such competitive pressures 
although to date we have not experienced significant competition from microsoft  their dominant position in the operating system market makes them capable of exerting competitive pressure in the systems management market as well 
we also face competition from several niche software vendors  particularly for our distributed systems product lines 
in addition  the software industry is experiencing continued consolidation 
there is a risk that some of our competitors may combine and consolidate market positions or combine technology  making them stronger competitors 
our products must remain compatible with ever changing operating and database environments 
ibm  hp  sun  microsoft and oracle are by far the largest suppliers of systems and database software and  in many cases  are the manufacturers of the computer hardware systems used by most of our customers 
historically  operating and database system developers have modified or introduced new operating systems  database systems  systems software and computer hardware 
such new products could incorporate features which perform functions currently performed by our products or could require substantial modification of our products to maintain compatibility with these companies hardware or software 
although we have to date been able to adapt our products and our business to changes introduced by hardware manufacturers and operating and database system software developers  there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future 
failure to adapt our products in a timely manner to such changes or customer decisions to forego the use of our products in favor of those with comparable functionality contained either in the hardware or operating system could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
future product development is dependent upon access to third party source code 
in the past  licensees using proprietary operating systems were furnished with source code  which makes the operating system generally understandable to programmers  and object code  which directly controls the hardware and other technical documentation 
since the availability of source code facilitated the development of systems and applications software which must interface with the operating systems  independent software vendors such as bmc were able to develop and market compatible software 
ibm and other hardware vendors have a policy of restricting the use or availability of the source code for some of their operating systems 
to date  this policy has not had a material effect on us 
some companies  however  may adopt more restrictive policies in the future or impose unfavorable terms and conditions for such access 
these restrictions may  in the future  result in higher research and development costs for us in connection with the enhancement and modification of our existing products and the development of new products 
although we do not expect that such restrictions will have this adverse effect  there can be no assurances that such restrictions or other restrictions will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
future product development is dependent upon early access to third party operating and database systems 
operating and database system software developers have in the past provided us with early access to pre generally available ga versions of their software in order to have input into the functionality and to ensure that we can adapt our software to exploit new functionality in these systems 
some companies  however  may adopt more restrictive policies in the future or impose unfavorable terms and conditions for such access 
these restrictions may result in higher research and development costs for us in connection with the enhancement and modification of our existing products and the development of new products 
although we do not expect that such restrictions will have this adverse effect  there can be no assurances that such restrictions or other restrictions will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
failure to adapt to technological change could adversely affect our earnings 
if we fail to keep pace with technological change in our industry  such failure would have an adverse effect on our revenues and earnings 
we operate in a highly competitive industry characterized by rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  changes in customer requirements and frequent new product introductions and enhancements 
during the past several years  many new technological advancements and competing products entered the marketplace 
the distributed systems and application management markets in which we operate are far more crowded and competitive than our traditional mainframe systems management markets 
our ability to compete effectively and our growth prospects depend upon many factors  including the success of our existing distributed systems products  the timely introduction and success of future software products  and the ability of our products to interoperate and perform well with existing and future leading databases and other platforms supported by our products 
we have experienced long development cycles and product delays in the past  particularly with some of our distributed systems products  and expect to have delays in the future 
delays in new product introductions or less than anticipated market acceptance of these new products are possible and would have an adverse effect on our revenues and earnings 
new products or new versions of existing products may  despite testing  contain undetected errors or bugs that could delay the introduction or adversely affect commercial acceptance of such products 
failure to maintain our existing distribution channels and develop additional channels in the future could adversely affect revenues and earnings 
with the acquisition of remedy  the percentage of our revenue from sales of our products and services through distribution channels such as systems integrators and value added resellers is increasing 
conducting business through indirect distribution channels presents a number of risks  including o each of our systems integrators and value added resellers can cease marketing our products and services with limited or no notice and with little or no penalty  o our existing systems integrators and value added resellers may not be able to effectively sell new products and services that we may introduce  o we do not have direct control over the business practices adopted by our systems integrators and value added resellers  o our systems integrators and value added resellers may also offer competitive products and services  o we may face conflicts between the activities of our indirect channels and our direct sales and marketing activities  and o our systems integrators and value added resellers may not give priority to the marketing of our products and services as compared to our competitors products 
changes in pricing practices could adversely affect revenues and earnings 
we may choose to make changes to our product packaging  pricing or licensing programs in response to customer demands or as a means to differentiate our product offerings 
if made  such changes may have a material adverse impact on revenues or earnings 
our customers may not accept our product strategies 
historically  we have focused on selling software products to address specific customer problems associated with their applications 
our bsm strategy requires us to integrate multiple software products so that they work together to provide comprehensive systems management solutions 
there can be no assurance that customers will perceive a need for such solutions 
in addition  there may be technical difficulties in integrating individual products into a combined solution that may delay the introduction of such solutions to the market or adversely affect the demand for such solutions 
we may also adopt different sales strategies for marketing our products  and there can be no assurance that our strategies for selling solutions will be successful 
risks related to business combinations 
as part of our overall strategy  we have acquired or invested in  and plan to continue to acquire or invest in  complementary companies  products  and technologies and to enter into joint ventures and strategic alliances with other companies 
risks commonly encountered in such transactions include the difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of the combined companies  the risk that we may not be able to integrate the acquired technologies or products with our current products and technologies  the potential disruption of our ongoing business  the inability to retain key technical  sales and managerial personnel  the inability of management to maximize our financial and strategic position through the successful integration of acquired businesses  the risk that revenues from acquired companies  products and technologies do not meet expectations  and decreases in reported earnings as a result of charges for in process research and development and amortization of acquired intangible assets 
for us to maximize the return on our investments in acquired companies  the products of these entities must be integrated with our existing products 
these integrations can be difficult and unpredictable  especially given the complexity of software and that acquired technology is typically developed independently and designed with no regard to integration 
the difficulties are compounded when the products involved are well established because compatibility with the existing base of installed products must be preserved 
successful integration also requires coordination of different development and engineering teams 
this too can be difficult and unpredictable because of possible cultural conflicts and different opinions on technical decisions and product roadmaps 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our product integration efforts or that we will realize the expected benefits 
with each of our acquisitions  we have initiated efforts to integrate the disparate cultures  employees  systems and products of these companies 
retention of key employees is critical to ensure the continued advancement  development  support  sales and marketing efforts pertaining to the acquired products 
we have implemented retention programs to keep many of the key technical  sales and marketing employees of acquired companies  nonetheless  we have lost some key employees and may lose others in the future 
enforcement of our intellectual property rights 
we rely on a combination of copyright  patent  trademark  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and contractual procedures to protect our intellectual property rights 
despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy certain portions of our products or to reverse engineer or obtain and use technology or other information that we regard as proprietary 
there can also be no assurance that our intellectual property rights would survive a legal challenge to their validity or provide significant protection for us 
in addition  the laws of certain countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will be able to protect our proprietary technology against unauthorized third party copying or use  which could adversely affect our competitive position 
possibility of infringement claims 
from time to time  we receive notices from third parties claiming infringement by our products of patent and other intellectual property rights 
we expect that software products will increasingly be subject to such claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segments grows and the functionality of products overlaps 
in addition  we may receive more patent infringement claims as companies increasingly seek to patent their software and business methods and enforce such patents  especially given the increase in software and business method patents issued during the past several years 
regardless of its merit  responding to any such claim could be time consuming  result in costly litigation and require us to enter into royalty and licensing agreements which may not be offered or available on terms acceptable to us 
if a successful claim is made against us and we fail to develop or license a substitute technology  our business  results of operations or financial position could be materially adversely affected 
risks related to international operations 
we have committed  and expect to continue to commit  substantial resources and funding to build our international infrastructure 
operating costs in many countries  including many of those in which we operate  are higher than in the united states 
to increase international sales in fiscal and subsequent periods  we must continue to globalize our software product lines  expand existing and establish additional foreign operations  hire additional personnel  identify suitable locations for sales  marketing  customer service and development  and recruit international distributors and resellers in selected territories 
future operating results are dependent on sustained performance improvement by our international offices  particularly our european operations 
our operations and financial results internationally could be significantly adversely affected by several risks such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates  sluggish regional economic conditions and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations 
generally  our foreign sales are denominated in our foreign subsidiaries local currencies 
if these foreign currency exchange rates change unexpectedly  we could have significant gains or losses 
we maintain a software development and information technology operations office in india which operates as an extension of our primary development and information technology operations and we contract with third party developers in india 
as other software companies have done and are continuing to do  we plan to continue to allocate more development and it resources to india with the expectation of achieving significant efficiencies  including reducing operational costs and permitting an around the clock development cycle 
to date  the dispute between india and pakistan involving the kashmir region has not adversely affected our operations in india 
should we be unable to conduct operations in india in the future  we believe that our business could be temporarily adversely affected 
we conduct substantial development and marketing operations in israel and  accordingly  we are directly affected by economic  political and military conditions in israel 
any major hostilities involving israel or the interruption or curtailment of trade between israel and its present trading partners could materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
we maintain comprehensive contingency and business continuity plans  and to date  the current conflict in the region and hostilities within israel have not caused disruption of our operations located in israel 
accounting pronouncements under consideration related to stock based compensation would reduce our reported earnings and could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key personnel by reducing the stock based compensation we are able to provide 
we have used stock options and other long term equity incentives as a fundamental component of our employee compensation packages 
we believe that stock options and other long term equity incentives directly motivate our employees to maximize long term stockholder value and  through the use of vesting  encourage employees to remain with bmc software 
in accounting for our stock option grants using the intrinsic value method under the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 we recognize no compensation cost because the exercise price of options granted is equal to the market value of our common stock on the date of grant 
the financial accounting standards board fasb is currently considering changes to us generally accepted accounting principles that  if implemented  would require us to record charges to earnings for employee stock option grants  which would negatively impact our earnings 
for example  as disclosed in note k to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  recording charges for employee stock options using the fair value method under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation would have reduced net earnings by million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
in addition  new regulations proposed by the new york stock exchange requiring stockholder approval for all stock option plans as well as new regulations prohibiting nyse member organizations from giving a proxy to vote on equity compensation plans unless the beneficial owner of the shares has given voting instructions could make it more difficult for us to grant options to employees in the future 
to the extent that new regulations make it more difficult or costly to grant options to employees  we may incur increased cash compensation costs or find it difficult to attract  retain and motivate employees  either of which could materially adversely affect our business 
possible adverse impact of interpretations of existing accounting pronouncements 
on april  and we adopted aicpa sop  software revenue recognition  and sop modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  respectively 
the adoption of these standards did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
based on our reading and interpretation of these sops  we believe that our current sales contract terms and business arrangements have been properly reported 
future interpretations of existing accounting standards or changes in our business practices could result in future changes in our revenue accounting policies that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of risks  including foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and changes in the market value of our investments 
in the normal course of business  we employ established policies and procedures to manage these risks including the use of derivative instruments 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we operate globally and the functional currency for most of our non us enterprises is the local currency 
for fiscal  and  approximately  and of our total revenues were derived from customers outside of north america  substantially all of which were billed and collected in foreign currencies 
similarly  substantially all of the expenses of operating our foreign subsidiaries are incurred in foreign currencies 
as a result  our us dollar earnings and net cash flows from international operations may be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
to minimize our risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  we utilize certain derivative financial instruments 
we primarily utilize two types of derivative financial instruments in managing our foreign currency exchange risk forward exchange contracts and purchased option contracts 
forward exchange contracts are used to reduce currency exposure associated with our rights and obligations denominated in foreign currencies that subject us to transaction risk 
the terms of these forward exchange contracts are generally one month or less and are entered into at the prevailing market rate at the end of each month 
forward exchange contracts and purchased option contracts  with terms generally less than one year  are used to hedge anticipated  but not firmly committed  sales transactions 
principal currencies hedged are the euro and british pound in europe  the japanese yen and australian dollar in the asia pacific region and the israeli shekel 
while we actively manage our foreign currency risks on an ongoing basis  there can be no assurance our foreign currency hedging activities will offset the full impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on our results of operations  cash flows and financial position 
foreign currency fluctuations did not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position during fiscal  or based on our foreign currency exchange instruments outstanding at march   we estimate a one day maximum potential loss on our foreign currency exchange instruments of million based on a value at risk var model utilizing monte carlo simulation 
the comparable estimate based on our foreign currency exchange instruments outstanding at march  was million utilizing the same model 
the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a confidence level 
the average var for the period was million for fiscal and million for fiscal the var model is a risk estimation tool  and as such  is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that could be incurred 
interest rate risk investments we adhere to a conservative investment policy  whereby our principle concern is the preservation of liquid funds while maximizing our yield on such assets 
cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities approximated billion at march   and were primarily invested in different types of investment grade debt securities 
although our portfolio is subject to fluctuations in interest rates and market conditions  no gain or loss on any security would actually be recognized in earnings unless the instrument was sold or the loss in value was deemed to be other than temporary 
based on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and net cash flows for the year ended march   we estimate that a near term change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our future consolidated results of operations or cash flows or the fair values of the investments 
we used a var variance covariance model to measure potential market risk on our marketable securities due to interest rate fluctuations 
the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a confidence level 
the var model is a risk estimation tool  and as such  is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that could be incurred
