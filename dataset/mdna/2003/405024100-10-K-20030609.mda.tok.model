compared to net revenues net revenues in fiscal increased million to million from million in fiscal the increase was a result of volume increases from both disposable and software sales 
foreign currency contributed to a small decrease in sales 
we recorded million of losses on our plan hedges in the current year compared to million of gains recorded on our plan hedges in fiscal these losses were largely offset by the increase in reported revenues due to the relative strength of the euro and the japanese yen 
see the discussion below entitled  foreign exchange  for a complete discussion of how foreign exchange impacts our business 
international sales accounted for of net sales for both fiscal years and disposable sales disposable sales increased or million 
by product line  disposable sales increased in worldwide red cell up  worldwide plasma sales up  worldwide surgical up  partly offset by decreases in worldwide bloodbank down 
red cell worldwide red cell sales grew due to volume increases in the us as customers new and existing reacted to red cell shortages by introducing automation into their collection operations as a means to increase the number of units of blood collected from a declining number of eligible donors 
the decline in the red cell supply in the us relates primarily to blood shortages and recently adopted donor deferral regulations mandated by the us food and drug administration 
plasma the growth in worldwide plasma disposable sales is attributed to volume increases of products sold in japan  asia and europe partially offset by volume decreases in the us market  which represents over one half of our plasma business 
acquisition of smaller plasma collection centers by large plasma manufacturing companies  including baxter international baxter  has altered the competitive landscape 
the us volume decrease is due to declining sales to one customer as a result of industry consolidation 
in addition  baxter announced that they would acquire  subject to regulatory approval  the plasma collection operations of alpha therapeutic corporation alpha during the first half of calendar in fiscal  sales of plasma disposables  including bowls  collection bottles and solutions  to alpha were approximately million 
alpha has several exclusive purchasing contracts with us which begin to lapse in january through we are unable to estimate the impact upon future operating results because we are uncertain about whether or when the sale will be consummated  and about baxter s plans for the collection centers  if purchased 
surgical worldwide surgical disposable sales  including both our traditional cardiovascular cell salvage business and our new orthopat r business  grew modestly 
we continue to implement a quality enhancement program for the orthopat r  therefore we slowed down the manufacture and sale of orthopat r products to our distributor 
we anticipate sales of our orthopat r product will accelerate in fiscal to reflect the higher sales growth rates experienced by our distributor 
our cardiovascular cell salvage business is stable  although we experienced a modest reduction in volume in bloodbank worldwide bloodbank disposable sales decreased as compared to due to volume decreases in both the us and european platelet markets and volume decreases of our automated cell processing acp r system 
the effects of these decreases were somewhat mitigated by volume growth in our asia platelet business 
the newest platelet collection technologies use a single disposable to collect multiple platelet units thereby reducing the number of disposables needed 
prior year sales related to our acp r system disposables were high due to the demand resulting from the events of september  as the majority of our bloodbank disposable sales are in our international markets  currency negatively impacted our bloodbank results to a greater extent than the other product lines 
miscellaneous and service sales miscellaneous and service sales includes revenues generated from equipment repairs performed under preventive maintenance contracts or emergency service billings and revenue from our software division  fifth dimension  acquired on january  miscellaneous and service sales increased or million year over year primarily as a result of a million increase from fifth dimension software products 
equipment sales equipment sales increased or million year over year due primarily to an increase in the volume of machines sold 
we increased equipment sales in our japanese plasma and platelet markets and in the european plasma market 
most of our equipment sales occur in markets outside the us as in the us we generally place equipment with a customer in exchange for an agreement to purchase disposables or to pay a rental fee 
due to the variable nature of equipment sales  we give no assurance as to whether or not this level of equipment sales will continue in the foreseeable future 
gross profit gross profit of million for fiscal decreased million from million for fiscal as a percentage of sales  gross profit decreased in fiscal to 
the million decrease in gross profit was a result of the negative effects of foreign currency  which were partially offset by the additional contribution from the increase in sales and from cost reductions generated by the customer oriented redesign for excellence core program 
the negative effect of foreign currency was primarily the result of million in losses recorded on our plan hedges in fiscal compared with million in gains recorded on our plan hedges in fiscal these losses were only partially offset by an increase in reported gross profit due to the relative strength of the euro and the japanese yen 
in fiscal  the core program generated a million improvement in our gross profit by automating and redesigning the way certain products are made and by negotiating reduced raw material prices from suppliers 
expenses research and development we spent million on research and development for both fiscal and small decreases in spending were offset by increases in expenses reported due to the relative strength of the euro and the japanese yen 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in spending is related to increases in selling  marketing  and field support expenses to support the higher volumes of sales  a full fiscal year of expenses from fifth dimension  which we acquired in q of fiscal  and increases in expenses reported due to the relative strength of the euro and the japanese yen 
acquired research and development in the third quarter of fiscal  we paid baxter million for the right to integrate the new pathogen reduction technology which baxter was developing into our platelet collection devices after the technology receives regulatory approval 
in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year we made an additional million milestone payment to baxter as they acquired their initial regulatory approvals in the european market 
because this technology has achieved commercial viability  this payment was capitalized as developed technology  and will be amortized over its useful life 
operating income operating income for fiscal increased million from fiscal but decreased to of sales in fiscal from in fiscal the million increase in operating income was a result of the reduction in acquired research and development  revenue driven gross profit improvements  and cost reductions generated by the core program  and was almost fully offset by increased selling  general and administrative spending and most significantly the negative effect of foreign currency 
the negative effect of foreign currency was primarily the result of million in losses recorded on our plan hedges in fiscal compared with million in gains recorded on our plan hedges in fiscal foreign exchange approximately of our sales are generated outside the us  yet our reporting currency is the us dollar 
foreign exchange risk arises because we engage in business in foreign countries in local currency  primarily the euro and the japanese yen 
exposure is partially mitigated by producing and sourcing product in local currency and expenses incurred by local sales offices 
however  whenever the us dollar strengthens relative to the other major currencies  there is an adverse affect on our results of operations and alternatively  whenever the us dollar weakens relative to the other major currencies there is a positive effect on our results of operations 
it is our policy to minimize for a period of time  the unforeseen impact on our financial results of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates by using derivative financial instruments known as forward contracts to hedge the anticipated cash flows from forecasted foreign currency denominated sales 
we refer to these contracts as our plan hedges 
hedging through the use of forward contracts does not eliminate the volatility of foreign exchange rates  but because we generally enter into forward contracts one year out  rates are fixed for a one year period  thereby facilitating financial planning and resource allocation 
we compute a composite rate index for purposes of measuring  comparatively  the change in foreign currency hedge spot rates from the hedge spot rates of the corresponding period in the prior year 
the relative value of currencies in the index is weighted by sales in those currencies 
the composite was set at based upon the weighted rates at march  the composite rate is presented in the period corresponding to the maturity of the underlying forward contracts 
the favorable or unfavorable changes are in comparison to the same period of the prior year 
a favorable change is presented when we will obtain relatively more us dollars for each of the underlying foreign currencies than we did in the prior period 
an unfavorable change is presented when we obtain relatively fewer us dollars for each of the underlying foreign currencies than we did in the prior period 
these indexed hedge rates impact sales  and as a result also gross profit  operating income and net income  in our financial statements 
the final impact of currency fluctuations on the results of operations is dependent on the local currency amounts hedged and the actual local currency results 
composite index favorable unfavorable hedge spot rates change versus prior year fy q q q q total fy q q q q total fy q q q q total fy q q q q total fy q other income expense  net interest expense for fiscal was relatively flat compared to fiscal nearly all of our long term debt is at fixed rates 
interest income decreased million from to  due primarily to lower average balances of cash invested and lower investment yields 
other income  net increased million from fiscal to fiscal due to foreign exchange transaction gains in fiscal as compared to transaction losses in fiscal and income recorded to reflect an anticipated payment for a customer contract termination 
these increases in other income were offset in large part by decreases in income earned from points on forward contracts in fiscal as compared to fiscal points on forward contracts are amounts  either expensed or earned  based on the interest rate differential between two foreign currencies in a forward hedge contract 
taxes the provision for income tax as a percentage of pretax income was for  down from in the decrease in fiscal effective tax rate and tax expense results from an anticipated income tax refund 
the q fiscal effective tax rate was  which is also anticipated to be our fiscal year effective tax rate

compared to net revenues net revenues in increased million to from in the increase was a result of volume increases from both disposable and software sales offset by the significant negative effects of foreign currency 
the relative strength of the us dollar compared to the japanese yen and to a much lesser extent the euro in fiscal had a negative impact on reported revenues  this was offset by million in additional gains from our plan hedges 
international sales accounted for and of net sales for fiscal and  respectively 
disposable sales disposable sales increased year over year 
this increase resulted from growth in worldwide surgical up  worldwide red cell up  and worldwide plasma up offset by a decrease in worldwide bloodbank down surgical the growth in worldwide surgical disposable sales was mainly attributed to volume increases of existing products in the european markets and the success of our recently launched orthopat r products in the us orthopedic market 
red cell the growth in worldwide red cell sales was attributed to volume increases in the us and european markets 
the growth of red cells was unfavorably impacted in the aftermath of september  as customers temporarily slowed or suspended conversion to automation  and by the delay announced in january in the further rollout of the double red cell technology by the american red cross arc 
subsequently  the arc received approval from the food and drug administration on its software information system changes and standard operating procedure upgrades necessary to expand its red cell program beyond the pilot sites using our technology 
the arc s decision to continue expansion of its red cell program was announced in december of plasma the growth in worldwide plasma disposable sales was attributed to volume increases of products sold in the us due to increased plasma collections in fiscal approximately of our volume growth in the us was due to sales of bottles as we purchased a container business in the fourth quarter of last year and from the sales of haemonetics brand anticoagulant solution introduced to our plasma product line in fiscal bloodbank worldwide bloodbank disposable sales grew slightly in fiscal as compared to fiscal  however the negative effects of currency more than offset this growth 
the growth in worldwide bloodbank disposable sales resulted from volume increases in platelet disposable sales in japan and asia and from volume increases in the us market resulting from the rollout of the acp r automated cell processing system 
miscellaneous and service sales miscellaneous and service sales include revenues generated from equipment repairs performed under preventive maintenance contracts or emergency service billings and  effective the fourth quarter of  revenue from our software division  fifth dimension 
miscellaneous and service sales decreased or million as a result of negative effects of currency partly offset by million of increases from fifth dimension software products 
equipment sales equipment sales increased or million year over year due to volume increases 
the volume increase was primarily because of sales of our acpr systems due to demand resulting from the events of september  most of our equipment sales occur in markets outside the us in the us we generally place equipment with a customer in exchange for an agreement to purchase disposables or to pay a rental fee 
due to the variable nature of equipment sales  we give no assurance as to whether or not this level of equipment sales will continue in the foreseeable future 
gross profit gross profit of million in fiscal increased million from million in fiscal the increase from fiscal was a result of increased contribution from higher sales  efficiency gains due to higher manufacturing volumes and cost reductions partly offset by significant negative effects from foreign currency 
the relative strength of the us dollar compared to the japanese yen and the euro in fiscal had a negative impact on gross profit 
this was somewhat offset by million in additional gains from our plan hedges 
in  we initiated the customer oriented redesign for excellence core program core program to increase operational effectiveness and improve all aspects of customer service 
the core program is based on total quality of management  tqm principals  and the program aims to increase the efficiency and the quality of processes and products  and to improve the quality of management at haemonetics 
for fiscal  the core program generated million improvement in our gross profit by automating and redesigning the way certain products are made and by negotiating reduced raw material prices from suppliers 
expenses research and development we spent million  of net revenues  on research and development in and million  of net revenues  in selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase was due to higher sales and increased spending behind new product sales and marketing activities partly offset by reductions in the amount of reported expenses due to the relative strength of the us dollar 
acquired research and development pathogen reduction technology in the third quarter of fiscal  we paid million to baxter for the right to integrate a new pathogen reduction technology into our platelet collection devices 
initial european regulatory clearance was received in fiscal and clearances in other geographies are anticipated over the next few years 
transfusion technologies in process research and development ipr d upon consummation of the acquisition of transfusion technologies corporation transfusion in the second quarter of fiscal  we incurred costs representing the value of the research and development projects 
included in the purchase price allocation for the acquisition of transfusion was an aggregate amount of purchased in process research and development ipr d of million  million of which is reflected in the restatement of fiscal year relative to our original investment 
the values represent purchased in process technology that had not yet reached technical feasibility and had no alternative future use 
accordingly  the amounts were immediately expensed in the consolidated statement of operations as acquired research and development see note in the audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the acquisition and ipr d charges 
a brief description of the ipr d projects related to the acquisition of transfusion  including their estimated stage of completion and associated discount rates is outlined below 
chairside separator r 
the chairside separator r is a portable  automated device used for the donor side collection and processing of a single unit of whole blood into a unit of red cell concentrate and plasma 
unlike our other red cell collection systems  the chairside separator r does not return any blood components to the donor during a donation 
the system is designed for use in a blood center  hospital  or mobile blood drive location and can be powered either through a standard ac outlet or by dc battery packs 
at the time of the acquisition  we estimated that the chairside separator r project was complete and that product sales would commence by the fourth quarter of fiscal the ipr d value assigned to the chairside separator r was million 
a discount rate of was employed in the analysis 
we completed the clinical safety study on july  and submitted the k to the food and drug administration fda on september  the fda has not yet approved the chairside separator r and we have reallocated resources to speed the development of the red cell collector discussed below 
we estimate the remaining cost to obtain marketing clearance from the fda at approximately  red cell collector rcc 
the rcc is a portable  automated device used for the collection and processing of two units of red blood cells from donors 
the system collects and automatically anticoagulates a donor s whole blood while separating it into red blood cells and plasma 
the plasma and ml of saline is then re infused back to the donor 
the system is designed for use in a blood center  hospital  or mobile blood drive location and can be powered either through a standard ac outlet or by dc battery packs 
at the time of the acquisition  we estimated that the rcc project was complete and that product sales would commence by the second quarter the ipr d value assigned to the rcc was million 
a discount rate of was employed in the analysis 
as of march   the estimated percent completion of the rcc project is 
product sales are expected to commence in europe during fiscal year estimates for cost of sales  sg a expenses and income tax rates relative to the rcc project remain unchanged 
the majority of design  software programming  disposable set development  and sourcing requirements are complete 
in addition  clinical trials will be conducted prior to submission of a k to the fda 
the estimated cost to be incurred to develop the purchased in process rcc technology into a commercially viable product is million in fiscal other unusual charges unusual charges expensed as a result of the acquisition of transfusion amounted to million and included million in bonuses paid to key transfusion executives hired by haemonetics and severance to employees laid off due to overlaps created by the merger  a million write off of an investment in fluid warming technology which haemonetics decided not to pursue in lieu of the technologies acquired in the merger  and the adjustment required to modify our investment of of transfusion in november of fiscal from the cost method to the equity method of accounting as required by generally accepted accounting principles 
to affect this change  the historic cost of the investment made by haemonetics was written down by its share of the monthly losses incurred by transfusion from november the charge to the statement of operations related to this adjustment was million for the year ended march  operating income operating income for increased million to as a percentage of net revenues from in fiscal the million increase in operating income resulted largely from improvements in gross profit and million in decreased acquired research and development and unusual charges in fiscal as compared to fiscal these operating income increases were offset by increases in fiscal in both research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses and significant negative effects from foreign currency 
other income expense  net interest expense for was relatively flat as compared to as nearly of our long term debt is at fixed rates  we have not benefited from lower interest rates in the marketplace 
interest income decreased million from to  due primarily to the continuing trend of customer preference for  and our policy of moving toward  placing on loan company owned equipment versus selling it under long term sales type leases 
investment income was relatively flat from to  as lower interest rates have offset the benefit from higher average cash and available for sale investment balances 
including the cumulative effect of accounting change of million related to the adoption of sfas  as amended  other income  net increased million  due to the reduction of foreign exchange transaction losses and to the reduction of amortization expense as a result of our adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective april   which required that we cease amortization of goodwill 
taxes the income tax provision  as a percentage of pretax income  was for fiscal  down from in fiscal excluding the non deductible charges in connection with the transfusion technologies acquisition  our effective tax rate was in the decrease in tax expense from the federal statutory to our effective tax rate is primarily attributable to the foreign sales corporation and the extraterritorial income exclusion and differences between us and foreign statutory rates 
cumulative effect of accounting change  net of tax in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no

 we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities and sfas no 
accounting for certain derivative instruments and hedging activities  an amendment of fasb statement no 
 collectively  sfas no 
 as amended effective  april   the beginning of our fiscal year 
as required  these standards were adopted as a change in accounting principle and accordingly  the effect at adoption of million was shown net of taxes of million as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle on the face of the consolidated statements of operations in the year ended march  critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are summarized in note of our financial statements 
while all of these significant accounting policies impact our financial condition and results of operations  we view certain of these policies as critical 
policies determined to be critical are those policies that have the most significant impact on our financial statements and require management to use a greater degree of judgment and or estimates 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
the accounting policies identified as critical are as follows revenue recognition we recognize revenues in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as outlined in sab no 
which requires that four basic criteria be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  product delivery  including customer acceptance  has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we believe that our revenue recognition policy is critical because revenue is a very significant component of our results of operations 
with our acquisition of fifth dimension information systems  inc fifth dimension in january  we have recorded software sales in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended  and in instances where services are essential to the functionality of the software  which represents the majority of fifth dimension s software sales  revenue is recognized in accordance with sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
in accordance sop  when the services are essential to the functionality of the software  or payment of the license fees are dependent upon the performance of the services  the software license  configuration  training and implementation fees are recognized under the contract method of accounting using labor hours to measure the completion percentage 
in order to apply the contract method of accounting  management is required to estimate the number of hours needed to complete a particular project 
as a result  recognized revenues and profits are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
income taxes in preparing our consolidated financial statements  income tax expense is calculated for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating actual current taxes due plus assessing temporary differences arising from differing treatment for tax and accounting purposes which are recorded as deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets are periodically evaluated to determine their recoverability  and where their recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance is established and a corresponding additional tax expense is recorded in our statement of operations 
in the event that actual results differ from our estimates given changes in assumptions  the provision for income taxes could be materially impacted 
as of march   no valuation allowance existed on our books 
the total net deferred tax asset as of march  was million 
inventories we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
on a quarterly basis  inventory quantities on hand are reviewed and an analysis of the provision for excess and obsolete inventory is performed based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements for the next twenty four months 
a significant increase in the demand for our products could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
additionally  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
in the future  if our inventory is determined to be overvalued as a result of understating its provision for excess and obsolete inventory  such costs would be required to be recorded in our cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
likewise  if our inventory is determined to be undervalued  as a result of overstating our provision for excess and obsolete inventory  we may have over reported our costs of goods sold in previous periods and would be required to recognize such additional operating income at the time of sale 
therefore  although every effort is made to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and reported operating results 
other intangibles purchase accounting requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the fair market value of the assets and liabilities purchased  with the excess value  if any  being classified as goodwill 
in addition  as described in notes and of our financial statements  as a result of our acquisitions  values were assigned to intangible assets for patented and unpatented technologies and customer contracts and related relationships 
for those assets with finite lives  useful lives were assigned to these intangibles and they will be amortized over their remaining life 
if conditions exist that indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable  we review these assets for impairment to ensure they are appropriately valued 
such conditions may include a change in the competitive landscape  a decision to employ new or different technology strategies  or a significant change in the prices paid for our products 
we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use and  if applicable  the eventual disposition of our assets 
the key variables that management must estimate include sales volume  prices  inflation  marketing spending  exchange rates and capital spending 
for developed technology that has not been deployed we also must estimate the likelihood of pursuing a particular strategy 
significant judgment is involved in making these estimates 
future write downs may be required if the value of the assets become impaired 
property  plant and equipment property  plant and equipment are depreciated over their useful lives 
useful lives are based on our estimate of the period that the assets will generate revenue 
any change in conditions that would cause us to change our estimate as to the useful lives of a group or class of assets may significantly impact our depreciation expense on a prospective basis 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of capital include cash and short term investments  internally generated cash flows and bank borrowings 
we believe these sources to be sufficient to fund our requirements  which are primarily capital expenditures  acquisitions  new business development  share repurchase  and working capital for at least the next twelve months 
during the fiscal year ended march   we funded our activities primarily with million of cash flows generated by operations  million of gross proceeds from the sale of available for sale securities and million in stock option proceeds 
working capital at march   was million 
this reflects a decrease of million in working capital from the same period in the prior year largely due to decreases in available for sale investments and increases in short term borrowings and increases in accrued liabilities 
contractual obligations and contingencies a summary of our contractual and commercial commitments as of march   were as follows see note and note to the consolidated financial statements payments due by period less than after contractual obligations in thousands total year years years years debt      operating leases      other purchase commitments   total      includes amounts we are committed to spend on significant purchase orders with contract manufacturers  specifically nova biomedical  for the purchase of orthopat r machines and jms co 
ltd  and kawasumi laboratories for the manufacture of certain disposable products 
contingent commitments the acquisition of fifth dimension  which occurred on january   involves potential earn out payments of up to million based on fifth dimension reaching certain performance milestones prior to fiscal the first milestone payment  in the amount of million was earned and accrued as of the end of our fiscal this payment was allocated to goodwill 
this payment will be made in the first quarter of fiscal the acquisition of the right to integrate a new pathogen reduction technology into our platelet collection devices includes certain incremental milestone payments based on the receipt of regulatory approvals in the us  europe and japan 
the total amount of these potential milestone payments is million 
in the third quarter of fiscal  baxter received initial regulatory approval in the european market 
in connection with this approval  we made an initial million milestone payment to baxter during the fourth quarter of fiscal we expect that the remaining european approvals will be obtained during fiscal and we anticipate making an additional milestone payment of million to baxter at that time 
these payments will be recorded as other technology  an intangible asset  and amortized over their useful lives 
cash flow overview cash and short term investments during the fiscal year ended march   before the effect of exchange rates  increased million  which represents an increase in cash flow of million compared to the million in cash used during the fiscal year ended march  the million increase was primarily a result of the cash generated in fiscal from the available for sale investments and from our operating activities 
these increases were largely offset by the increase in fiscal treasury stock repurchases and less cash received in fiscal from stock option exercises 
operating activities cash provided by operating activities was million for the fiscal year ended march   as compared to million in fiscal the million increase in operating cash flow for compared to was due largely to the leveling off of inventory increases  an increase in accrued taxes due to an increase in our effective tax rate in q of fiscal together with a reduction in tax payments and an increase in accrued expenses partly offset by an increase in accounts receivable 
accrued expenses increased due to the increase in our accruals for other than income tax accounts and obligations associated with the retirement of our past president and ceo 
accounts receivable increased due to the increase in sales and in the days sales outstanding year over year 
the increase in days sales outstanding year over year is due largely to the timing of payments 
investing activities we generated million from investing activities in fiscal  which represents an increase of million from the million in cash utilized in fiscal the million increase in cash was a result of the liquidation of our available for sale investments in fiscal  less cash spent on capital expenditures in fiscal  and the acquisition of fifth dimension in fiscal we liquidated our available for sale investments because of changes in the interest rate environment 
financing activities our financing activities used million in cash as compared to million used in fiscal this increase in cash utilized is primarily a result of the million spent in fiscal to repurchase our stock  a decrease in the short term debt borrowings in japan and a decline in proceeds from stock option exercises 
in fiscal  we repurchased  shares of our stock at an average price of for a total of million  of which  million shares were purchased under a b plan adopted in fiscal our b plan was terminated at the end of fiscal the board s authorization for additional buyback remains in effect with approximately million remaining of the original million authorized 
we keep repurchased shares on hand for our employee benefit and incentive plans and for other corporate purposes 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on our results of operations for the periods presented 
historically  we believe we have been able to minimize the effects of inflation by improving our manufacturing and purchasing efficiency  by increasing employee productivity and by adjusting the selling prices of new products we introduce 
cautionary statement regarding forward looking information statements contained in this report  as well as oral statements we make which are prefaced with the words may  will  expect  anticipate  continue  estimate  project  intend  designed  and similar expressions  are intended to identify forward looking statements regarding events  conditions  and financial trends that may affect our future plans of operations  business strategy  results of operations  and financial position 
these statements are based on our current expectations and estimates as to prospective events and circumstances about which we can give no firm assurance 
further  any forward looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made  and we undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made 
as it is not possible to predict every new factor that may emerge  forward looking statements should not be relied upon as a prediction of our actual future financial condition or results 
these forward looking statements  like any forward looking statements  involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or anticipated 
such risks and uncertainties include technological advances in the medical field and our standards for transfusion medicine and our ability to successfully implement products that incorporate such advances and standards  product demand and market acceptance of our products  regulatory uncertainties  the effect of economic and political conditions  the impact of competitive products and pricing  foreign currency exchange rates  changes in customers ordering patterns  and the effect of uncertainties in markets outside the us including europe and asia in which we operate 
the foregoing list should not be construed as exhaustive 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposures relative to market risk are due to foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk 
foreign exchange risk see the section entitled foreign exchange for a discussion of how foreign currency affects our business 
it is our policy to minimize for a period of time  the unforeseen impact on our financial results of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates by using derivative financial instruments known as forward contracts to hedge anticipated cash flows from forecasted foreign currency denominated sales 
we do not use the financial instruments for speculative or trading activities 
at march   we had the following significant foreign exchange contracts to hedge the anticipated cash flows from forecasted foreign currency denominated sales outstanding hedged buy sell weighted spot weighted forward currency local currency contract rate contract rate fair value maturity euro   apr jun euro   jul sep euro   oct dec euro   jan feb japanese yen  per us per us  apr jun japanese yen  per us per us  jul sep japanese yen  per us per us  oct dec japanese yen  per us per us  jan feb total  we estimate the change in the fair value of all forward contracts assuming both a strengthening and weakening of the us dollar relative to all other major currencies 
in the event of a strengthening of the us dollar  the change in fair value of all forward contracts would result in a million increase in the fair value of the forward contracts  whereas a weakening of the us dollar would result in a million decrease in the fair value of the forward contracts 
interest rate risk all of our long term debt is at fixed rates 
accordingly  a change in interest rates has an insignificant effect on our interest expense amounts 
the fair value of our long term debt  however  does change in response to interest rates movements due to its fixed rate nature 
at march   the fair value of our long term debt was approximately million higher than the value of the debt reflected on our financial statements 
this higher fair market is entirely related to our million  fixed rate senior notes and our million  real estate mortgage 
at march   the fair value of our long term debt was approximately million higher than the value of the debt reflected on our financial statements 
this higher fair value is primarily related to the million  fixed rate senior notes and the million  real estate mortgage 
using scenario analysis  if we changed the interest rate on all long term maturities by from the rate levels that existed at march  the fair value of our long term debt would change by approximately million 
concentration of credit risk and significant customers financial instruments that potentially subject the company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents  accounts receivable and investment in sales type lease receivables 
sales to one unaffiliated japanese customer  the japanese red cross society  amounted to million  million and million for  and  respectively 
concentration risk on our accounts receivable attributable to this customer accounted for  and of total accounts receivable for  and  respectively 
while the accounts receivable related to the japanese red cross society may be significant  we do not believe the credit loss risk to be significant given the consistent payment history by this customer
