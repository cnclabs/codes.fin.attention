item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the years ended december    and the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of the company and its subsidiaries should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and selected statistical information incorporated by reference 
application of critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
the company considers the following accounting policies and related estimates to be the most critical in their potential effect on its financial position or results of operations allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a charge against current earnings to the provision for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is based on management s estimate of the amount required to reflect the probable inherent losses in the loan portfolio  based on circumstances and conditions known at each reporting date in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
there are three components of the allowance for loan losses specific reserves for loans considered to be impaired or for other loans for which management considers a specific reserve to be necessary  allocated reserves based upon management s formula based process for assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  and a non specific environmentally driven allowance considered necessary by management based on its assessment of other qualitative factors 
the allowance for loan losses is a significant estimate and is regularly reviewed by the company for adequacy using a consistent  systematic methodology which assesses such factors as changes in the mix and volume of the loan portfolio  trends in portfolio credit quality  including delinquency and charge off rates  and current economic conditions that may affect a borrower s ability to repay 
adverse changes in management s assessment of these factors could lead to additional provisions for loan losses 
the company s methodology with respect to the assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is more fully discussed on pages of management s discussion and analysis 
goodwill impairment 
the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangibles  effective january  the statement addresses the method of identifying and measuring goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in a business combination  eliminates further amortization of goodwill  and requires periodic impairment evaluations of goodwill 
impairment evaluations are required to be performed annually and may be required more frequently if certain conditions indicating potential impairment exist 
in the event that the company were to determine that its goodwill were impaired  the recognition of an impairment charge could have an adverse impact on its results of operations in the period that the impairment occurred or on its financial position 
income taxes 
the company must estimate income tax expense in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates for each period for which a statement of operations is presented 
this involves estimating the company s actual current tax exposure as well as assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as timing of the deduction of expenses  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
the company must also assess the likelihood that any deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance must be established 
significant management judgment is required in determining income tax expense  and deferred tax assets and liabilities 
as of december   there were no valuation allowances set aside against any deferred tax assets 
mortgage servicing rights msr or msrs 
servicing assets are recognized as separate assets when rights are acquired through purchase or through sale of financial assets 
capitalized servicing rights are reported in other assets and are amortized into noninterest income in proportion to  and over the period of  the estimated future net servicing income of the underlying financial assets 
servicing assets are evaluated for impairment based upon the fair value of the rights as compared to amortized cost 
impairment is determined by stratifying rights by predominant characteristics  such as interest rates and original loan terms primarily and year 
fair value is determined using prices for similar assets with similar characteristics  when available  or based upon discounted cash flows using market based assumptions 
in periods of falling market interest rates  accelerated loan prepayment speeds can adversely impact the fair value of these mortgage servicing rights relative to their book value 
in the event that the fair value of these assets were to increase in the future  the company can recognize the increased fair value to the extent of the impairment allowance but cannot recognize an asset in excess of its amortized book value 
when the book value of an individual stratum exceeds its fair value  an impairment reserve must be recognized 
future changes in management s assessment of the impairment of these servicing assets  as a result of changes in observable market data relating to market interest rates  loan prepayment speeds  and other factors  could impact the company s financial condition and results of operations either positively or adversely 
interest income recognition 
interest on loans is included in income as earned based upon interest rates applied to unpaid principal 
interest is not accrued on loans days or more past due unless they are adequately secured and in the process of collection or on other loans when management believes collection is doubtful 
all loans considered impaired are nonaccruing 
interest on nonaccruing loans is recognized as payments are received when the ultimate collectibility of interest is no longer considered doubtful 
when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status  all interest previously accrued is reversed against current period interest income  therefore an increase in loans on nonaccural status could have a adverse impact on interest income recognized in future periods 
results of operations on february   the company acquired ocean national corp  headquartered in kennebunk  maine and its subsidiary  ocean national bank for million in cash 
on april   the company acquired maine bank corp  headquartered in portland  maine and its subsidiary  maine bank trust for million in cash 
these acquisitions have been accounted for as purchases and  accordingly  the operations of mbt and onb are included in these financial statements from their dates of acquisition 
on may   the company completed the acquisition of vermont financial services corp 
in a stock for stock transaction accounted for as a pooling of interests 
accordingly  the consolidated financial statements of the company were restated to reflect the acquisition as of the beginning of the earliest period presented 
the company recognized million of after tax special charges in and an additional  in related to the acquisition of vfsc which included gains and losses on branch sales mandated as part of the acquisition  impaired goodwill of vfsc relating to chz market areas which was written off upon consummation of the merger  other merger costs including severance payments  legal fees  etc  and the related tax effects of taxable income or deductible expense 
the results excluding these special charges are referred to in the following discussion as operating 
management considers these non gaap operating measures to be appropriate for comparison to operational performance of other fiscal periods in which these unique revenues and expenses did not occur 
a reconciliation of the company s net income loss to its operating net income for the years ended december  and is presented below net income loss  as reported less gain loss on branch sales impaired goodwill written off upon merger merger costs tax effect on merger costs tax effect of gain loss on branch sales operating net income after tax impact of special charges  per share performance summary net income for was million  an increase of million  or from the million recorded in net income of million in was flat with the million recorded for diluted earnings per share for were compared to for and for return on average assets roa and return on average equity roe are two industry measures on which the financial performance of a banking institution is generally measured 
during  the company s roa was compared to in and in the decline in roa was primarily due to the acquisitions of mbt and onb 
during  the company s roe was compared to and in and  respectively 
the decrease in return on equity from to was primarily attributable to significantly higher levels of unrealized gains in the investment portfolio  due to lower overall market interest rates  which increased stockholders equity 
excluding the unrealized gains in the investment portfolio  the return on average equity would have been for and a year ago 
chittenden s net interest income increased million in compared to the increase was attributed primarily to the acquisitions of onb and mbt  growth in deposits  and the trust preferred securities tps issuance 
the provision for loan losses was  higher in due primarily to the acquisition of onb 
noninterest income increased million in primarily due to increases in service charges on deposits  insurance commissions  and other income 
the increase of million in service charges on deposits was attributed to the strong deposit flows throughout as well as high cash management fees 
gains on sales of loans declined million as a result of the sale of the company s retail credit card portfolio in  which generated a million gain 
gains on sales of mortgage loans were million higher in than in as a result of strong refinancing activity throughout mortgage servicing income was approximately million lower in as a result of the recognition of million in msr impairment reserves and an additional million of msr amortization 
gains on sales of securities of million were realized in as a result of the rebalancing of the company s available for sale securities portfolio caused by lower interest rates  which accelerated paydowns on mortgage backed securities 
noninterest expenses were million in compared with million in salaries and employee benefits increased million from the level 
the inclusion of onb for ten months and mbt for the full year vs 
eight months in represented million of the increase 
also  incentive accruals were million higher in than net occupancy expense increased million from primarily as a result of the onb and mbt acquisition 
amortization of intangibles decreased million in due to the adoption of fas overall  net income was flat in compared to net interest income increased million  primarily as a result of the acquisition of mbt 
the provision for loan losses was  lower in due to lower levels of non performing assets 
noninterest income increased million in primarily due to increases of million in gains on sales of loans and million in investment management income 
the increase in gains on sales of loans was primarily due to higher volumes of loans sold in mortgage banking activities as well as to the gain of million on the sale of the company s retail credit card portfolio 
noninterest expenses were million in compared with million in salaries and employee benefits increased million from the level 
the inclusion of mbt amounted to million of the increase 
also  incentive accruals were million higher in than in addition  a million pension curtailment gain taken in the first quarter of upon the merger of the vermont national and chittenden bank pension plans reduced expenses for the previous year 
net occupancy and amortization expenses increased million and  respectively as a result of the inclusion of mbt in the amounts 
total assets increased from billion at december  to billion at december  primarily as a result of the acquisition of onb  the tps issuance and growth in deposits 
total assets increased from billion in to million in  as a result of the acquisition of mbt 
financial condition loans chittenden s loan portfolio at december  totaled billion compared to billion at year end the classification of the company s loan portfolio is based on underlying collateral 
acquired in the onb transaction were loans totaling million  of which million were commercial loans  million were commercial real estate loans  million were residential real estate loans  million were home equity loans  and million were consumer loans 
commercial real estate loans  representing of the portfolio  increased million or to billion at year end  compared to million at december  this increase was caused by the acquisition of onb  in which million in commercial real estate loans were obtained  and by strong growth in these loans at the other affiliate banks 
the overall proportion of commercial related loans continued to increase in due to the move in commercial real estate loans discussed above 
at december   commercial loans secured by non real estate business assets totaled million or of total loans 
included in the commercial portfolio are business credit cards  which amounted to million in compared to million in residential real estate loans including home equity loans held flat at million in as a result of the onb acquisition 
total paydowns of the residential real estate portfolio were million in compared with million in new originations added to the portfolio did not keep pace with paydowns because the preponderance of loans originated in were fixed rate loans sold on the secondary market 
approximately one quarter of the construction portfolio at december  related to residential construction which amounted to million at december   an increase of million from million the year before 
the remaining three fourths of the construction portfolio related to commercial real estate construction 
the majority of both types of construction loans are to borrowers who will eventually occupy the properties 
residential mortgages originated during totaled million  compared to million during this increase was due to continued high volumes of fixed rate residential loans caused by increasingly lower market rates throughout the company underwrites substantially all of its residential mortgages to secondary market standards 
the company continues to follow its policy of selling substantially all of its fixed rate residential mortgage production on a servicing retained non recourse basis 
secondary market sales of mortgage loans totaled million in  compared to million in the portfolio of residential mortgages serviced for investors totaled billion at december  compared to billion at year end these assets are owned by investors other than chittenden and therefore are not included in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
the company originated approximately percent of the serviced loan portfolio and the balance consisted of loans whose mortgage servicing rights were purchased in prior years 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 the company has recorded an originated mortgage servicing rights asset for all mortgages sold on a servicing retained basis since january  as noted under application of critical accounting policies  the company evaluates the msr asset for impairment on a quarterly basis 
at december  the msrs amortized cost of million was reduced by an impairment reserve of million  so that the carrying value of the msr asset was equal to its fair value at that date 
included in the real estate portfolio are outstanding balances under home equity credit lines  totaling million at december  compared to million the previous year 
the unused portion of these lines totaled million at december  compared to million at year end consumer loans decreased million or in  ending the year at million 
this decrease reflects paydowns on the automotive finance portfolio  driven by lower market interest rates  which outpaced originations 
the company views these loans as a discretionary investment and will not add to its portfolio if it cannot obtain what it considers to be an appropriate yield 
as a result of many manufacturers financing programs as low as  the company did not actively compete for this business in the company underwrites all of its indirect automotive loans on substantially the same credit standards as for car loans directly originated in its branch offices 
indirect installment lending through auto dealers was down million from year end to million at the end of lease financing receivables outstanding at december  were million  down from million a year earlier  of which million and million represented the residual value of these leases 
the large decline in lease financing receivables was a result of the company s decision to exit this market in late therefore the existing portfolio will continue to run off over the next three years 
the company has insurance through outside insurance companies  which substantially eliminates the risk associated with the residual value of its leased vehicle portfolio 
direct installment balances at december  stood at million compared with million at the end of this increase was due primarily to the acquisition of onb 
the company s lending activities are conducted in market areas focused in vermont  western and central massachusetts  southern maine  and southeastern new hampshire  with additional activity related to nearby trading areas in new york and connecticut 
in addition to the geographic portfolio diversification described above  the loans are widely diversified by borrowers and industry groups 
the following table shows the composition of the loan portfolio for the five years ended december  december  in thousands commercial real estate residential commercial construction home equity consumer lease financing total gross loans allowance for loan losses net loans loans held for sale nonperforming assets loans on which the accrual of interest has been discontinued are designated as nonaccrual loans 
management classifies loans as nonaccrual loans when they become days past due as to principal or interest  unless they are adequately secured and in the process of collection 
in addition  loans that have not met this delinquency test may be placed on nonaccrual at management s discretion 
to the extent that certain loans classified as nonaccrual based upon management s discretion have an associated governmental agency guarantee  a separate assessment of the classification of the guaranteed portion is made 
generally  as long as interest and principal are less than days past due  the guaranteed amounts are collectible from the guarantor and therefore are not classified as nonaccrual 
in these situations  only the non guaranteed portion of the loan would be classified as nonaccrual 
consumer and residential loans are included when management considers it to be appropriate  based upon evidence of collectibility  the value of any underlying collateral and other general criteria 
generally  a loan remains on nonaccrual status until the factors which indicated doubtful collectibility no longer exist or the loan is determined to be uncollectible and is charged off against the allowance for loan losses 
a loan is classified as a restructured loan when its interest rate is reduced and or other terms are modified because of the inability of the borrower to service debt at current market rates and terms 
other real estate owned oreo is real estate that has been formally acquired through foreclosure 
the following table shows the composition of nonperforming assets and loans past due days or more and still accruing interest as of the end of each of the five years ended december  december  in thousands loans on nonaccrual troubled debt restructurings other real estate owned total nonperforming assets loans past due days or more and still accruing percentage of nonperforming assets to total loans and other real estate owned nonperforming assets to total assets allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans  excluding oreo nonaccrual loans at december  consisted of approximately loans  which were diversified across a range of industries  sectors and geography 
nonaccrual loans with payments less than days past due are of total loans on nonaccrual 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is based on management s estimate of the amount required to reflect the probable inherent losses in the loan portfolio  based on circumstances and conditions known at each reporting date in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
there are three components of the allowance for loan losses specific reserves for loans considered to be impaired or for other loans for which management considers a specific reserve to be necessary  allocated reserves based upon management s formula based process for assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  and a non specific environmentally driven allowance considered necessary by management based on its assessment of other qualitative factors 
adequacy of the allowance is determined using a consistent  systematic methodology which analyzes the size and risk of the loan portfolio 
in addition to evaluating the collectibility of specific loans when determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  management also takes into consideration other factors such as changes in the mix and size of the loan portfolio  historic loss experience  the amount of delinquencies and loans adversely classified  and economic trends 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is assessed by an allocation process whereby specific loss allocations are made against certain adversely classified loans  and general loss allocations are made against segments of the loan portfolio which have similar attributes 
the company s historical loss experience  industry trends  and the impact of the local and regional economy on the company s borrowers  were considered by management in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is increased by provisions charged against current earnings 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes that the collectibility of the loan principal is unlikely 
recoveries on loans previously charged off are credited to the allowance 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses was adequate at december  while management uses available information to assess possible losses on loans  future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on increases in non performing loans  changes in economic conditions  or for other reasons 
any future additions to the allowance would be recognized in the period in which they were determined to be necessary 
in addition  various regulatory agencies periodically review the company s allowance for loan losses as an integral part of their examination process 
such agencies may require the company to record additions to the allowance based on judgements different from those of management 
credit quality of the commercial portfolios is quantified by a corporate credit rating system designed to parallel regulatory criteria and categories of loan risk 
individual loan officers monitor their loans to ensure appropriate rating assignments are made on a timely basis 
risk ratings and quality of both commercial and consumer credit portfolios are also assessed on a regular basis by an independent credit review department  which reports to the chief banking officer 
credit review personnel conduct ongoing portfolio trend analyses and individual credit reviews to evaluate loan risk and compliance with corporate lending policies 
the level of allowance allocable to each group of risk rated loans is then determined by applying a loss factor that estimates the amount of probable loss in each category 
the assigned loss factor for each risk rating is based upon management s assessment of historical loss data  portfolio characteristics  economic trends  overall market conditions and past experience 
consumer and residential real estate loan quality is evaluated on the basis of delinquency data and other credit data available due to the large number of such loans and the relatively small size of individual credits 
allocations for these loan categories are principally determined by applying loss factors that represent management s estimate of inherent losses 
in each category  inherent losses are estimated based upon management s assessment of historical loss data  portfolio characteristics  economic trends  overall market conditions and past experience 
in addition  certain loans in these categories may be individually risk rated if considered necessary by management 
the other method used to allocate the allowance for loan losses entails the assignment of reserve amounts to individual loans on the basis of loan impairment 
certain loans are evaluated individually and are judged to be impaired when management believes it is probable that the company will not collect all of the contractual interest and principal payments as scheduled in the loan agreement 
under this method  loans are selected for evaluation based on internal risk rating or non accrual status 
a specific reserve amount is allocated to an individual loan when that loan has been deemed impaired and when the amount of a probable loss is estimable on the basis of its collateral value  the present value of anticipated future cash flows  or its net realizable value 
at december   impaired loans with a specific reserve totaled  all of these loans were on nonaccrual status and the amount of such reserve was  results and recommendations from these processes provide senior management and the board of directors with independent information on loan portfolio condition 
the board of directors monitors asset quality throughout the year 
the following table summarizes the activity in the company s allowance for loan losses for the five years ended december  december  in thousands balance of allowance for possible loan losses at beginning of year allowance acquired through acquisitions provision charged to expense balance of allowance for possible loan losses after provision loans charged off commercial real estate residential commercial construction home equity consumer total loans charged off recoveries of loans previously charged off commercial real estate residential commercial construction home equity consumer total recoveries net loans charged off balance of allowance for possible loan losses at year end loans outstanding at end of year average loans outstanding during the year ratio of net charge offs during year to average loans outstanding allowance as a percent of loans outstanding at end of year the provision for loan losses represents the charge to expense that is required to maintain an adequate level of allowance for loan losses 
management s periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance considers past loan loss experience  known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio  adverse situations which may affect the borrowers ability to repay  the estimated value of the underlying collateral  if any  and current and prospective economic conditions 
the allowance for loan losses is allocated to various loan categories as part of the company s process of evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
allocated reserves increased by approximately million to million at december  changes in the distribution of the allocated allowance principally occurred due to the acquisition of onb which led to increases in the amount allocated to commercial and commercial real estate loans  while the amount allocated to consumer loans declined due to declines in the overall balance of loans in that portfolio 
the following table summarizes the allocation of the allowance for loan losses for the five years ended december  december  amount allocated loan distribution amount allocated loan distribution amount allocated loan distribution amount allocated loan distribution amount allocated loan distribution in thousands commercial real estate residential commercial construction home equity consumer and leasing other during  the allowance for loan loss allocated to commercial loans increased by million and the amount allocated to commercial real estate loans increased by million 
this was due primarily to increases in the amount of these loans in the overall loan portfolio 
during  the amount allocated to the consumer and leasing portfolios declined by approximately  while the overall percentage of portfolio loans in these categories declined from to 
this was primarily due to reductions in the indirect and leasing portfolios 
the other category is the allowance considered necessary by management based on its assessment of historical loss experience  industry trends  and the impact of the local and regional economy on the company s borrowers that may not have been captured in the specific risk classifications 
due to the imprecise nature of the loan loss estimation process and the effects of changing environmental conditions  these risk attributes may not be adequately captured in the data related to the formula based loan loss components used to determine allocations in the company s analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
therefore  management maintains a non specific environmentally driven allowance for loan losses 
the new england economy entered into a recession in and remains slow at year end 
new england unemployment levels have increased slightly from the levels seen the last few years  due to cutbacks in the manufacturing and services sectors  but overall unemployment levels are still low to moderate in most areas 
through december   the economic slowdown has not had a significant effect on the overall credit quality or incidence of default within the company s loan portfolios 
however  certain segments  such as manufacturing and retail  are showing significant signs of weakness on a national level and components of the company s loan portfolio  particularly commercial and commercial real estate loans are believed to be potentially vulnerable to a slowdown in economic activity 
also contributing to the need for a non specific environmentally driven allowance was the growth in the commercial and commercial real estate portfolios during including approximately million acquired in the onb transaction 
these portfolios are inherently riskier than the consumer and residential real estate portfolios and the company s loss factors used in its allocation process might not fully reflect any additional risk that may be caused by this growth 
notwithstanding the foregoing analytical allocations  the entire allowance for loan losses is available to absorb charge offs in any category of loans 
investment securities the investment portfolio is used to meet liquidity demands  mitigate interest rate sensitivity  invest excess liquidity  and generate interest income 
at december   the company held investments available for sale totaling billion 
this compares with investments of million available for sale at december  the increase from to is primarily attributable to deposit growth and to the issuance of the tps 
deposit levels throughout were unusually high due to stronger than normal deposit flows resulting from the current recessionary environment as well as weak financial markets  particularly after september  also contributing to higher deposit levels were the acquisition of mbt and onb  and strong deposit growth throughout the franchise 
the increase in mortgage backed securities from to reflects million in company originated residential mortgages that were securitized in and repurchased by the company  as well as increased liquidity in both and increases in us government agency obligations  and corporate bonds and notes also reflect the additional liquidity in at december   unrealized gains were million 
this compares with unrealized gains of million at december  the amounts resulted from declines in market interest rates and are reflected as an increase in stockholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income 
unrealized losses that are considered other than temporary are recorded as an expense against earnings

the average amount of the tps outstanding in was approximately million 
concurrent with the issuance of these securities  the company entered into interest rate swap agreements with two counterparties  in which the company will receive fixed on the notional amount of million  while paying the counterparties a variable rate based on the three month libor london interbank offered rate  plus approximately basis points

both the board of governors of the federal reserve system the frb and the federal deposit insurance corporation the fdic have defined leverage capital requirements  which measure tier i capital as defined below against average total assets without regard to risk weight 
additionally  the frb and the fdic have a risk based capital standard 
under this measure of capital  banks are required to hold more capital against certain assets perceived as higher risk  such as commercial loans  than against other assets perceived as lower risk  such as residential mortgage loans and us treasury securities 
further  off balance sheet items such as unfunded loan commitments and standby letters of credit  are included for the purposes of determining risk weighted assets 
commercial banking organizations are required to have total capital equal to of risk weighted assets  and tier capital consisting of common stock and certain types of preferred stock  including the tps up to of its total regulatory capital equal to at least of risk weighted assets 
tier capital  included in total capital  includes the allowance for possible loan losses up to a maximum of of risk weighted assets and any portion of the tps that exceeds of total equity 
at december   the company s risk based capital ratio was and its tier capital  consisting of common stock  and the entire balance of the million tps issuance  was of risk weighted assets 
this compares with year end ratios of and  respectively 
fdic regulations pertaining to capital adequacy  which apply to the banks  require a minimum leverage capital ratio for those institutions with the most favorable composite regulatory examination rating 
in addition  a tier risk based capital ratio  and an total risk based capital ratio are required for a bank to be considered adequately capitalized

liquidity the company s liquidity and rate sensitivity are monitored by the asset and liability committee  based upon policies approved by the board of directors 
the measure of an institution s liquidity is its ability to meet its cash commitments at all times with available cash or by conversion of other assets to cash at a reasonable price 
the company s affiliate banks generate significant amounts of low cost funds through their deposit gathering operations 
for the year ended december   the company s ratio of average loans to average deposits was approximately 
at december   the company maintained cash balances and short term investments of approximately million  compared with million at december  however  during the same time period securities available for sale increased from million to billion 
higher deposit levels and increased borrowings funded these increases 
borrowings at december  were million compared to million on december  the increase was primarily attributable to the issuance of the tps in may of the tps were issued to provide liquidity for potential future acquisitions  and until the funds are required in a transaction  the proceeds are being used to provide additional net interest income 
it is anticipated that the tps proceeds will be used to fund the cash portion of the consideration to be paid in the acquisition of granite state bankshares inc  in a transaction that is expected to close late in the first quarter of however  after the use of the tps proceeds in this transaction cash balances  short term investments  and securities available for sale would still exceed billion 
this compares to annual cash expenses of approximately million and approximately million in contractually obligated payments in the next twelve months 
in addition  the company has available borrowing capacity under certain programs including federal home loan bank borrowings  treasury tax loan borrowings  repo lines with investment banks  and advised fed funds lines totaling more than million 
the company also has an active registration statement in which an additional million in debt securities  common stock  preferred stock  or warrants that may be offered from time to time

interest rate spread is the average rate earned on total interest earning assets less the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
net yield on earning assets is net interest income divided by total interest earning assets 
the significant declines noted in the yield on earning assets and the costs of interest bearing liabilities relate to the numerous reductions in federal funds rates by the federal reserve during and and the resulting declines in market interest rates 
the following table attributes changes in the company s net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis to changes in either average balances or average rates

also  incentive accruals for the year were million higher in than and sales based incentive payments were million higher 
pension costs increased approximately  from a credit of  in to an expense of  in in addition  management expects that pension expense will increase significantly to approximately million due to significant declines in the fair value of the plans assets  from million in to million in reflected in the latest pension plan valuation results 
the anticipated expense is based on an expected rate of return on plan assets of 
the company invests approximately of its plan assets in corporate bonds and similar fixed income securities on which management expects to yield over the long term 
the remaining of the portfolio is invested in equity securities with an assumed long term rate of return of 
the weighted average of these two returns approximates the expected rate of return 
net occupancy expenses increased approximately million  as a result of the inclusion of onb in the amounts 
amortization of intangibles decreased million from million in due to the adoption of fas other noninterest expense for increased million from million in  primarily as a result of the acquisitions noted above

the company s effective tax rates differed from the statutory rates primarily because of state income taxes paid  net of benefit on federal taxes  and the proportion of interest income from state and municipal securities and loans and corporate dividends which are partially exempt from federal taxation  and tax credits on investments in qualified low income housing projects 
the company invests in these partnerships primarily as a means of managing its effective tax rate and targets its investments in communities where they qualify for inclusion as cra community reinvestment act eligible investments 
the decrease in the company s effective tax rate from to primarily reflects a higher level of housing project tax credits

qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the sensitivity of income to changes in interest rates  foreign exchanges  commodity prices  equity prices  and other market driven rates or prices 
since the company has no trading operations  risks associated with foreign exchange rates  commodity prices  and equity prices are not significant 
interest rate risk  including mortgage prepayment risk  is the single most significant non credit risk to which the company is exposed 
to measure the sensitivity of its income to changes in interest rates  the company uses a variety of methods  including simulation  valuation techniques and gap analyses 
interest rate risk is the sensitivity of income to variations in interest rates over both short term and long term horizons 
the primary goal of interest rate management is to control this risk within limits approved by the board of directors 
these limits and guidelines reflect the company s tolerance for interest rate risk 
the company attempts to control interest rate risk by identifying exposures  quantifying them and taking appropriate actions 
the company uses simulation analyses to measure the exposure of net interest income to changes in interest rates over a relatively short ie  within one year time horizon 
simulation analysis incorporates what management believes to be the most appropriate assumptions about customer and competitor behavior in the specified interest rate scenario 
these assumptions are the basis for projecting future interest income and expense from the company s assets and liabilities under various scenarios 
simulation analysis may have certain limitations caused by market conditions varying from those assumed in a model 
actual results can often differ due to the effects of prepayments and refinancings of loans and investments  as well as the repricing or runoff of deposits  which may be different from that which has been assumed 
the company s limits on interest rate risk specify that if interest rates were to shift immediately  shocked up or down basis points  estimated net interest income for the next twelve months should neither improve or be impacted by greater than 
an additional analysis is performed to review results if interest rates were to shift quarterly  ramped up or down and basis points over a twelve month period 
the results of these simulations are shown below interest rate sensitivity analysis as of december  shocked ramped net interest income net income net interest income net income in thousands forecast next months forecast bps change from forecast forecast bps change from forecast forecast bps change from forecast forecast bps change from forecast policy limit n a n a policy limit for ramped changes is not applicable because the shocked limit is more restrictive 
as noted above  one of the tools used to measure rate sensitivity is the funds gap 
the funds gap is defined as the amount by which a bank s rate sensitive assets exceed its rate sensitive liabilities 
a positive gap exists when rate sensitive assets exceed rate sensitive liabilities 
this indicates that a greater volume of assets than liabilities will reprice during a given period 
this mismatch will improve earnings in a rising rate environment and inhibit earnings when rates decline 
conversely  when rate sensitive liabilities exceed rate sensitive assets  the gap is referred to as negative and indicates that a greater volume of liabilities than assets will reprice during the period 
in this case  a rising rate environment will inhibit earnings and declining rates will improve earnings 
notwithstanding this general description of the effect on income of the gap position  it may not be an accurate predictor of changes in net interest income 
the company s limits on interest rate risk specify that the cumulative one year gap should be less than of total assets 
as of december   the estimated exposure was and the company was liability sensitive
