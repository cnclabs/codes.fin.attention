item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
general over the last three years  we have emphasized adding reserves through drilling activity  while adding reserves through strategic purchases of producing properties when oil and gas prices were at lower levels and other market conditions were appropriate 
we used this flexible strategy of employing both drilling and acquisitions to add more reserves than we depleted through production during this period 
proved oil and gas reserves 
at year end  our total proved reserves were bcfe with a pv value of billion 
in  our proved natural gas reserves increased bcf  or  while our proved oil reserves increased mmbbl  or  for a total equivalent increase of bcfe  or 
in  our proved natural gas reserves decreased by bcf  or  while our proved oil reserves increased by mmbbl  or  for a total equivalent increase of bcfe  or 
we added reserves in through both our drilling activity and through purchases of minerals in place 
through drilling we added bcfe bcfe of which came from new zealand of proved reserves in  bcfe bcfe of which came from new zealand in  and bcfe bcfe of which came from new zealand in through acquisitions we added bcfe of proved reserves in  bcfe in  and bcfe in at year end  of our total proved reserves were proved developed  compared with at year end and at year end our total proved reserves quantities at year end increased by over reserves quantities a year earlier  while the pv value of those reserves increased from the pv value at year end gas prices increased in to per mcf from per mcf at year end  compared to per mcf at year end oil prices increased in to per barrel from per bbl at year end  compared to in under sec guidelines  estimates of proved reserves must be made using year end oil and gas sales prices and are held constant throughout the life of the properties 
subsequent changes to such year end oil and gas prices could have a significant impact on the calculated pv value 
while our total proved reserves quantities increased by during  the pv value of those reserves decreased  due to much lower prices at year end than at year end between those two year ends  there was a decrease in natural gas prices and a decrease in oil prices 
this decrease in prices resulted in bcfe of downward reserves revisions  solely attributed to the decrease in prices at year end the year end gas price of was significantly lower than the average gas price of we received during the year end oil price of per barrel was also lower than the average oil price of we received in contractual commitments and obligations our contractual commitments for the next five years and thereafter are as follows thereafter non cancelable operating lease commitments       capital commitments due to pipeline operators  senior notes due  senior notes due  credit facility which expires in october these amounts do not include the interest obligation  which is paid semiannually 
the repayment of the credit facility is based upon the zero balance at december  this amount excludes million of a standby letter of credit issued under this facility 
these amounts exclude asset retirement obligations  as accounted for under sfas no 
accounting for asset retirement obligations 
we adopted this statement on january   and recorded a liability of million 
this standard required us to record a liability for the fair value of its dismantlement and abandonment costs  excluding salvage values 
commodity price trends and uncertainties oil and natural gas prices historically have been volatile and will likely continue to be volatile in the future 
worldwide supply disruptions  such as the reduction in crude oil production from venezuela  together with perceived risks such as the threat of war between the united states and iraq  along with other factors  have caused the price of oil to increase significantly in the first quarter of when compared to historical prices 
other factors such as actions taken by opec  worldwide economic conditions  and weather conditions can cause wide fluctuations in the price of oil 
natural gas prices have also increased significantly in the first quarter of when compared to historical prices 
north american weather conditions  the industrial and consumer demand for natural gas  storage levels of natural gas  and the availability and accessibility of natural gas deposits in north america can cause wide fluctuations in the price of natural gas 
all of the above factors are beyond our control 
liquidity and capital resources during  we principally relied upon cash provided by operating activities of million  net proceeds from the issuance of long term debt of million  and net proceeds from our public stock offering of million  less the repayment of bank borrowings of million  to fund capital expenditures of million 
during  we relied both upon internally generated cash flows of million and upon additional borrowings from our bank credit facility of million to fund capital expenditures of million 
net cash provided by operating activities 
in  net cash provided by our operating activities decreased by to million  as compared to million in and million in the decrease of million was primarily due to a reduction of oil and gas sales of million due to lower commodity prices and to an increase in interest of million due to the higher debt balances and interest rates in the increase of million was primarily due to a million reduction in working capital as oil and gas sales receivables decreased in along with a reduction in interest expense of million 
these increases in cash flow were offset by an million reduction of oil and gas sales  a million increase in oil and gas production costs  and a million increase in general and administrative expense 
existing credit facilities 
at december   we had no outstanding borrowings under our credit facility 
our credit facility at year end consisted of a million revolving line of credit with a million borrowing base 
the borrowing base is re determined at least every six months and was reconfirmed by our bank group in november with the million borrowing base 
our revolving credit facility includes  among other restrictions  requirements as to maintenance of certain minimum financial ratios principally pertaining to working capital  debt  and equity ratios and limitations on incurring other debt 
we are in compliance with the provisions of this agreement 
the credit facility extends until october at december   we had million in outstanding borrowings under this facility 
working capital 
our working capital increased from a deficit of million at december   to a deficit of million at december  the increase was primarily due to reductions in payables to partnerships related to december property sales 
capital expenditures 
in  our capital expenditures of approximately million included new zealand activities of million as follows o million  or  on producing properties acquisitions  with approximately million spent on the tawn acquisition and the remainder for the cash portion of our bligh and antrim acquisitions  o million  or  on developmental drilling to further delineate the rimu and kauri areas  o million  or  on gas processing plants  principally the rimu production station  o million  or  for exploratory drilling in the rimu and kauri areas  o million  or  on prospect costs  principally seismic and geological costs  o million  or less than  for fixed assets  principally computers and office furniture and fixtures 
domestic activities of million as follows o million  or  on developmental drilling  o million  or  on domestic prospect costs  principally leasehold  seismic  and geological costs  o million  or  on exploratory drilling  o million  or  for producing property acquisitions  including the purchase of property interests from partnerships managed by us  o million  or  on gas processing plants in the brookeland and masters creek areas  o million  or less than on field compression facilities  and o million  or less than  for fixed assets 
in  we participated in drilling domestic development wells and seven domestic exploratory wells  of which development wells and three exploratory wells were successful 
in new zealand three development wells and three exploratory wells were drilled 
one of the development wells and one of the exploratory wells were dry 
we currently plan to spend to million in total capital expenditures in  excluding acquisition costs and net of approximately million to million in non core property dispositions 
the budget for is largely dependent upon performance and pricing during the year 
domestic activities account for of budgeted spending  primarily in the lake washington area 
we believe that the anticipated internally generated cash flows for  together with bank borrowings under our credit facility  will be sufficient to finance the costs associated with our currently budgeted capital expenditures 
if other producing property acquisitions become attractive during  we will explore the use of debt and or equity offerings to fund such activity 
our capital expenditures were approximately million in and million in during  we used cash flows from operating activities of million to fund capital expenditures of million  along with part of the remaining net proceeds from our third quarter issuance of senior notes and common stock 
during  we relied both upon internally generated cash flows of million and upon additional borrowings of million from our bank credit facility to fund capital expenditures of million 
our capital expenditures in included domestic activities of million as follows o million  or  on developmental drilling  o million  or  for producing property acquisitions  with approximately million spent on the lake washington acquisition and the remainder for the purchase of property interests from partnerships managed by us  o million  or  on exploratory drilling  o million  or  on domestic prospect costs  principally leasehold  seismic  and geological costs  o million  or less than  for fixed assets  o million on field compression facilities  and o million on gas processing plants in the brookeland and masters creek areas 
new zealand activities of million as follows o million  or  on developmental drilling to further delineate the rimu and kauri areas  o million  or  on the rimu production station  o million  or  for exploratory drilling in the rimu and kauri areas  o million  or  on prospect costs  principally seismic and geological costs  o million  or less than  on producing property acquisition evaluation costs related to our tawn acquisition  and o million for fixed assets  principally computers and office furniture and fixtures 
in  we participated in drilling development wells and exploratory wells  of which development wells and six exploratory wells were successful 
four of the development wells were drilled in new zealand to delineate the rimu and kauri areas  two of which were successful 
two of the exploratory wells were drilled in new zealand  one was unsuccessful and one was temporarily abandoned 
results of operations revenues 
our revenues in decreased by compared to revenues in due primarily to decreases in oil and gas prices 
partially offsetting the decrease in commodity prices received was the effect of an increase in production from our new zealand and lake washington areas 
oil and gas sales revenues in decreased by  or million  from the level of those revenues for even though our net sales volumes in increased by  or bcfe  over net sales volumes in average prices received for oil decreased to per bbl in from per bbl in average gas prices received decreased to per mcf in from per mcf in the increase in production during the period is primarily from our new zealand and lake washington areas 
in  our million decrease in oil and gas sales resulted from oprice variances that had a million unfavorable impact on sales  of which million was attributable to the decrease in average oil prices received and million was attributable to the decrease in average gas prices received  and ovolume variances that had a million favorable impact on sales  with million of increases coming from the  bbl increase in oil sales volumes  and million of the increases from the bcf increase in gas sales volumes 
revenues in decreased by compared to revenues 
in  oil and gas sales revenues decreased by  or million  from the level of those revenues in even though our net sales volumes in increased by  or bcfe  over net sales volumes in average prices received for oil decreased to per bbl in from per bbl in average gas prices received decreased slightly to per mcf in from per mcf in in  our million decrease in oil and gas sales resulted from oprice variances that had a million unfavorable impact on sales  of which million was attributable to the decrease in average oil prices received and million was attributable to the slight decrease in average gas prices received  and ovolume variances that had a million favorable impact on sales  with an increase of million from the  bbl increase in oil sales volumes offset somewhat by a decrease of million from the bcf decrease in gas sales volumes

in the table above  for  natural gas liquids have been combined with oil and condensate for reporting purposes 
the natural gas liquids production for was  mbbls  at an average price of per barrel 
in march  we received million for our interest in the samburg project located in western siberia  russia as a result of the sale by a third party of its ownership in a russia joint stock company that owned and operated the field 
although the proceeds from sales of oil and gas properties are generally treated as a reduction of oil and gas property costs  because we had previously charged to expense all million of cumulative costs relating to our russian activities  this cash payment  net of transaction expenses  resulted in recognition of a million non recurring gain on asset disposition in the first quarter of this activity was recorded in gain on asset disposition in the accompanying consolidated statement of income 
during  we recognized net losses of  relating to our derivative activities  as compared to net gains of  in in   of the losses were unrealized  while  of losses recognized in were unrealized 
this activity is recorded in price risk management and other  net on the accompanying income statement 
revenues from our oil and gas sales comprised of total revenues for and of total revenues for both and natural gas production made up of our production volumes in  in  and in costs and expenses 
our expenses in decreased million  or  compared to expenses 
the majority of the decrease was due to the million non cash write down of domestic oil and gas properties in  offset by increases in operating costs in related to our increased activities in new zealand 
our expenses in increased by million  or  compared to expenses 
the majority of this increase was due to the non cash write down of domestic oil and gas properties in our general and administrative expenses  net in increased million  or  from the level of such expenses in  while general and administrative expenses increased million  or  over levels 
these increases reflect additional costs needed to run our increased activities in new zealand  along with a reduction in reimbursement from partnerships we manage as these partnerships have liquidated 
our general and administrative expenses per mcfe produced increased to per mcfe in from per mcfe in and per mcfe in the portion of supervision fees netted from general and administrative expenses was million for  million for  and million for depreciation  depletion  and amortization of our assets  or dd a  decreased million  or  in from levels  while dd a increased million  or  from levels 
domestically  dd a decreased million due to decreased production in the period  the domestic non cash write down of oil and gas properties in the fourth quarter of that decreased our depletable oil and gas property base  and higher reserve volumes that were added primarily though our lake washington activities 
in new zealand  our production and the depletable oil and gas property base both increased in the period due primarily to the tawn acquisition 
the may commissioning of our rimu production station also increased the depletable oil and gas property base 
in  the increase domestically was primarily due to additional dollars spent to add to our reserves and increased associated costs in an environment where demand for oil and gas services had increased compared to  along with a increase in production 
our dd a rate per mcfe of production was in  in  and in  reflecting variations in per unit cost of reserves additions 
our production costs per mcfe produced were in  in  and in the portion of supervision fees netted from production costs was million for  million for  and million for our production costs in increased million  or  over such expenses in  while those expenses in increased million  or  over costs 
overall  production costs increased in as our new zealand activities increased  offsetting the domestic production costs decrease which mainly was due to a decrease in production volumes 
approximately million of the increase in production costs during was related to severance taxes 
severance taxes increased primarily from the expiration of certain specific well severance tax exemptions 
the remainder of the increase reflected costs associated with new wells drilled and acquired and the related increase in costs in procuring such services in an environment where demand for oil and gas services has increased from the prior year 
interest expense on our senior notes issued in july  including amortization of debt issuance costs  totaled million in and million in both and interest expense on our senior notes issued in april  including amortization of debt issuance costs  totaled million in interest expense on our convertible notes due  including amortization of debt issuance costs  totaled million in interest expense on the credit facility  including commitment fees and amortization of debt issuance costs  totaled million in  million in  and million in the total interest cost in was million  of which million was capitalized 
the total interest cost in was million  of which million was capitalized 
the total interest cost was million  of which million was capitalized 
we capitalize that portion of interest related to our exploration  partnership  and foreign business development activities 
the increase in interest expense in was attributed to the replacement of our bank borrowings in april with the senior notes that carry a higher interest rate 
the decrease in total interest expense in was attributed to the conversion and extinguishment of our convertible notes in december and the increase in capitalized interest  partially offset by the increase in interest paid on our credit facility 
in the fourth quarter of  we recognized a domestic non cash write down of oil and gas properties  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
lower prices for both oil and natural gas at december   necessitated a pre tax domestic full cost ceiling write down of million  or million after tax 
in addition to this domestic ceiling write down  we also expensed million of charges in the fourth quarter of for certain delinquent accounts receivable  the majority of which were related to gas sold to enron  and a write off of debt issuance costs for a planned offering that was cancelled based upon market conditions following the events of september  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we adopted sfas no 
 amended by sfas no 
and sfas no 
 on january  our adoption of sfas no 
resulted in a one time net of taxes charge of  which is recorded as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle on the consolidated statement of income 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million loss on the early extinguishment of debt net of taxes  as discussed in note to the financial statements 
we called our convertible notes for redemption effective december  holders of approximately million of the convertible notes elected to convert their notes into shares of our common stock 
holders of the remaining million of the convertible notes elected to redeem their notes for cash plus accrued interest 
this cash redemption resulted in this extraordinary item 
net income loss 
our net income in of million was higher and basic earnings per share basic eps of was higher than our net loss of million and basic loss per share basic eps of 
our earnings per diluted share in of was higher than our loss per diluted share of 
these amounts increased in due to overall lower costs  as a non cash write down of oil and gas properties occurred in and not  offset somewhat by lower revenue in our net loss in of million was lower and basic loss per share of was lower than our net income of million and basic earnings per share of 
our earnings per diluted share in of was lower than our earnings per diluted share of 
these decreases reflected the effect of million in charges in as described above 
critical accounting policies the following summarizes several of our critical accounting policies 
see a complete list of significant accounting policies in note to the consolidated financial statements 
use of estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  if any  at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from estimates 
property and equipment 
we follow the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas property and equipment costs 
under this method of accounting  all productive and nonproductive costs incurred in the exploration  development and acquisition of oil and gas reserves are capitalized 
under the full cost method of accounting  such costs may be incurred both prior to or after the acquisition of a property and include lease acquisitions  geological and geophysical services  drilling  completion and equipment 
internal costs incurred that are directly identified with exploration  development and acquisition activities undertaken by us for our own account  and which are not related to production  general corporate overhead or similar activities  are also capitalized 
for the years   and  such internal costs capitalized totaled million  million  and million  respectively 
interest costs related to unproved properties are also capitalized to unproved oil and gas properties 
interest not capitalized and general and administrative costs related to production and general overhead are expensed as incurred 
no gains or losses are recognized upon the sale or disposition of oil and gas properties  except in transactions involving a significant amount of reserves or where the proceeds from the sale of oil and gas properties would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil and gas attributable to a cost center 
future development  site restoration  and dismantlement and abandonment costs  net of salvage values  are estimated property by property based on current economic conditions and are amortized to expense as our capitalized oil and gas property costs are amortized 
we compute the provision for depreciation  depletion  and amortization of oil and gas properties by the unit of production method 
under this method  we compute the provision by multiplying the total unamortized costs of oil and gas properties including future development  site restoration  and dismantlement and abandonment costs  net of salvage value  but excluding costs of unproved properties by an overall rate determined by dividing the physical units of oil and gas produced during the period by the total estimated units of proved oil and gas reserves 
this calculation is done on a country by country basis 
furniture  fixtures and other equipment are depreciated by the straight line method at rates based on the estimated useful lives of the property 
repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred 
renewals and betterments are capitalized 
the cost of unproved properties not being amortized is assessed quarterly  on a country by country basis  to determine whether such properties have been impaired 
in determining whether such costs should be impaired  we evaluate current drilling results  lease expiration dates  current oil and gas industry conditions  international economic conditions  capital availability  foreign currency exchange rates  the political stability in the countries in which we have an investment  and available geological and geophysical information 
any impairment assessed is added to the cost of proved properties being amortized 
to the extent costs accumulate in countries where there are no proved reserves  any costs determined by management to be impaired are charged to expense 
full cost ceiling test 
at the end of each quarterly reporting period  the unamortized cost of oil and gas properties  net of related deferred income taxes  is limited to the sum of the estimated future net revenues from proved properties using unhedged period end prices  discounted at  and the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties  adjusted for related income tax effects ceiling test 
this calculation is done on a country by country basis for those countries with proved reserves 
the calculation of the ceiling test and provision for depreciation  depletion  and amortization is based on estimates of proved reserves 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting the future rates of production  timing  and plan of development 
the accuracy of any reserves estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
results of drilling  testing  and production subsequent to the date of the estimate may justify revision of such estimate 
accordingly  reserves estimates are often different from the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered 
in the fourth quarter of  as a result of low oil and gas prices at december   we reported a non cash write down on a before tax basis of million million after tax on our domestic properties 
we had no write down on our new zealand properties 
given the volatility of oil and gas prices  it is reasonably possible that our estimate of discounted future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves could change in the near term 
if oil and gas prices decline from our period end prices used in the ceiling test  even if only for a short period  it is possible that additional non cash write downs of oil and gas properties could occur in the future 
price risk management activities 
we follow sfas no 
which requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
the statement also establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be reported in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
special hedge accounting for qualifying hedges would allow the gains and losses on derivatives to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statements and would require that a company formally document  designate  and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
we have a price risk management policy to use derivative instruments to protect against declines in oil and gas prices  mainly through the purchase of protection price floors and collars 
we adopted sfas no 
effective january  accordingly  we marked our open contracts at december   to fair value at that date  resulting in a one time net of taxes charge of  which was recorded as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
during and  we recognized net losses of  and net gains of  relating to our derivative activities 
approximately  of the losses recognized in were unrealized as the contracts were still open  while  of losses recognized in the comparative period were unrealized 
this activity is recorded in price risk management and other  net on the accompanying statements of income 
at december   we had recorded  net of taxes of  of derivative losses in other comprehensive loss on the accompanying balance sheet 
this amount represents the change in fair value for the effective portion of our collar transactions that were qualified as cash flow hedges 
the ineffectiveness reported in price risk management and other  net for was not material 
we expect to reclassify all amounts held in other comprehensive loss into the statement of income within the next six months 
as of december   we had entered into the cash flow hedge commodity derivative instruments set forth in the table below for our domestic oil and natural gas production for portions of when we entered into the following transactions they were designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows associated with the forecasted sale of our oil and natural gas production 
changes in the fair value of a hedge that is highly effective and is designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge  to the extent that the hedge is effective  are initially recorded in other comprehensive income loss 
when the hedged transactions are recorded upon the actual sale of oil and natural gas  these gains or losses are transferred from other comprehensive income loss and recorded in price risk management and other  net on the statement of income 
the fair value of our derivatives are computed using the black scholes option pricing model and are periodically verified against quotes from brokers 
the fair value of these instruments is recognized on the balance sheet  in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  at december  crude oil cash flow hedges collars floors ceilings december  period and type volume in weighted weighted fair value of contract bbls s average average s january june participating collar contracts total natural gas cash flow hedges collars floors ceilings december  period and type volume in weighted weighted fair value of contract mmbtu s average average s january june participating collar contracts  total in january and february  we entered into natural gas floors financial transactions covering contract periods april to october notional volumes are  mmbtu per month at a weighted average floor price of per mmbtu

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional discussion of commodity risk 
related party transactions we have been the operator of a number of properties owned by our affiliated limited partnerships and  accordingly  charge these entities operating fees 
the operating fees charged to the partnerships in   and totaled approximately   and  respectively  and are recorded as reductions of general and administrative expense and oil and gas production expense 
we also have been reimbursed for direct  administrative  and overhead costs incurred in conducting the business of the limited partnerships  which totaled approximately   and  in   and  respectively 
in partnerships in which the limited partners voted to sell their remaining properties and liquidate their limited partnerships  we also have been reimbursed for direct  administrative  and overhead costs incurred in the disposition of such properties  which costs totaled approximately   and  in   and  respectively 
forward looking statements the statements contained in this report that are not historical facts are forward looking statements as that term is defined in section e of the securities and exchange act of  as amended 
such forward looking statements may pertain to  among other things  financial results  capital expenditures  drilling activity  development activities  cost savings  production efforts and volumes  hydrocarbon reserves  hydrocarbon prices  liquidity  regulatory matters  and competition 
such forward looking statements generally are accompanied by words such as plan  future  estimate  expect  budget  predict  anticipate  projected  should  believe  or other words that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes 
such forward looking information is based upon management s current plans  expectations  estimates  and assumptions  upon current market conditions  and upon engineering and geologic information available at this time  and is subject to change and to a number of risks and uncertainties  and  therefore  actual results may differ materially 
among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are volatility in oil and natural gas prices  internationally or in the united states  availability of services and supplies  fluctuations of the prices received or demand for our oil and natural gas  the uncertainty of drilling results and reserve estimates  operating hazards  requirements for capital  general economic conditions  changes in geologic or engineering information  changes in market conditions  competition and government regulations  as well as the risks and uncertainties discussed herein and set forth from time to time in our other public reports  filings  and public statements 
also  because of the volatility in oil and gas prices and other factors  interim results are not necessarily indicative of those for a full year 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity risk 
our major market risk exposure is the commodity pricing applicable to our oil and natural gas production 
realized commodity prices received for such production are primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot prices applicable to natural gas 
the effects of such pricing volatility are discussed above  and such volatility is expected to continue 
our price risk program permits the utilization of agreements and financial instruments such as futures  forward and options contracts  and swaps to mitigate price risk associated with fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices 
below is a description of the financial instruments we have utilized to hedge our exposure to price risk 
oprice floors at february   we had in place price floors in effect through the october contract month for natural gas and april for crude oil 
the natural gas price floors cover notional volumes of  mmbtu  with a weighted average floor price of per mmbtu 
the crude oil price floors cover notional volumes of  barrels of oil  with a weighted average floor price of per barrel 
oparticipating collars at february   we had in place certain collar financial transactions in effect through the june contract month 
the natural gas collars cover notional volumes of  mmbtu  with a floor price of per mmbtu and ceiling prices ranging from per mmbtu to per mmbtu  plus participation by us in prices realized above the ceiling 
the crude oil collars cover notional volumes of  barrels of oil  with floor prices ranging from to per barrel and ceiling prices ranging from to per barrel  plus participation by us in prices realized above these ceilings 
onew zealand gas contracts all of our gas production in new zealand is sold under long term  fixed price contracts denominated in new zealand dollars 
these contracts protect against price volatility  and our revenue from these contracts will vary only due to production fluctuations and foreign exchange rates 
interest rate risk 
our senior notes have a fixed interest rate  so consequently we are not exposed to cash flow risk from market interest rate changes on our senior notes 
at december   we had no outstanding borrowings under our credit facility  which is subject to floating rates and therefore susceptible to interest rate fluctuations 
the result of a fluctuation in the bank s base rate would constitute basis points and would not impact cash flows based on this same level of borrowing 
financial instruments debt maturities 
our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable  bank borrowings  and notes 
the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the highly liquid nature of these short term instruments 
the fair values of the bank borrowings approximate the carrying amounts as of december  and  and were determined based upon interest rates currently available to us for borrowings with similar terms 
based on quoted market prices as of the respective dates  the fair value of our senior notes due was million at december   and million at december  based upon quoted market prices as of the respective dates  the fair value of our senior notes due was million at december  our credit facility with the banks expires october  our million senior notes mature on august  our million senior notes mature on may  customer credit risk 
we are exposed to the risk of financial non performance by customers 
our ability to collect on sales to our customers is dependant on the liquidity of our customer base 
to manage customer credit risk  we monitor credit ratings of customers and seek to minimize exposure to any one customer where other customers are readily available 
due to availability of other purchasers  we do not believe the loss of any single oil or gas customer would materially affect our revenues
