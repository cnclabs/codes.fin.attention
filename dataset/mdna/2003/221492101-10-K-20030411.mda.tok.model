overview we began our operations in by opening a mid sized warehouse club style store in maui  hawaii 
in  we began to expand by opening stores built to our specifications  in other island locations 
after experiencing success with our mid sized store concept  we began to enter various mainland markets in late  occupying existing retail spaces on favorable lease terms  while continuing to open more stores in island markets that were built to our specifications 
over the course of a three year period  we opened six mainland stores and seven island stores 
due to a lack of success in the mainland markets  we decided in to return our focus to our core island markets and we began closing our mainland stores 
the process of closing five of our six mainland stores was completed in currently  only one mainland store remains open and serves as an efficient testing ground for new operating and merchandising methods 
in  we opened two stores in fiji  and in we opened two stores in new zealand and one in curacao  netherland antilles 
during fiscal  we focused on improving our mix of stores in our relatively small store base  as under performing stores were having a materially adverse impact on our performance 
in june  we closed our two new zealand stores  as well as our buying office in auckland 
although we believed that we had introduced what was to be the first warehouse club concept to the new zealand marketplace  we believe that the loyalty of new zealand customers to many regional brands resulted in disappointing sales by the new stores of the us brands we primarily sold 
in february  we closed one of our two fiji stores  due primarily to the impact that the political turmoil in fiji was having on the tourist industry 
the resulting economic downturn severely impacted the performance of our store in nadi  fiji 
our remaining store in fiji is located in the city of suva  which is the capital and the primary population center of fiji 
on june   we opened a store on the island of st 
maarten in the caribbean 
we believe this island market has market conditions that resemble those in islands in which we have been successful 
we are continuing to focus on our core island store operations by reviewing our merchandising strategies  both those that apply to all stores and those specific to each store in light of the different conditions in each market 
currently  we have no plans to open new stores during other than rebuilding our dededo  guam store  but we are in the process of analyzing opportunities for future expansion 
while we believe these actions can improve profitability  there can be no assurance that these actions will be successful 
we also continue to explore ways to maximize long term value for our shareholders  including focusing on efforts to increase earnings  responding to competition  and improving same store sales and gross margins 
we believe the number of new island markets with the attributes for our existing growth strategy is limited and is decreasing as a result of  among other things  changing market conditions 
we are currently evaluating alternative methods of implementing future expansion we currently operate ten retail stores with an eleventh store being rebuilt as follows two stores in each of hawaii and guam  and one store in each of st 
thomas  st 
croix  american samoa  fiji  curacao  st 
maarten and sonora  california 
on december   our two stores on the island of guam suffered damage from the supertyphoon pongsona  resulting in the immediate closure of both stores 
our tamuning store  lost its generator in the storm  but reopened shortly thereafter on december th 
our dededo store  however  suffered more significant damage  and has yet to reopen 
we believe that the building structure is most likely a total loss and we are in the process of rebuilding with an expected reopening in late our stores are patterned after the warehouse club concept  although the stores i are smaller averaging approximately  square feet vs 
large format warehouse clubs of approximately  square feet  ii generally target niche markets  mainly us territories  us island states and foreign island countries  where demographics do not support large format warehouse clubs  iii carry a wide assortment of local and ethnic food items  and iv do not charge a membership fee 
although we do not have large seasonal fluctuations in sales  the fourth quarter is typically the highest sales quarter due to additional holiday sales 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of our net sales represented by certain consolidated income statement data 
fiscal year ended december  december  december  net sales gross margin operating expenses store general and administrative 
store opening store closing operating income loss interest expense  net other expense income loss before income taxes income tax provision net income loss the year ended december  was a week fiscal year 
the years ended december  and december  were week fiscal years 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales in fiscal of million declined as compared to net sales of million for the comparable period in the prior year 
the slight decline in net sales was primarily due to lower business to business sales in the current year as compared to particularly strong sales in the prior year 
we expect the level of business to business activity to continue to be slightly lower throughout fiscal conversely  comparable store sales stores open for a full months increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal  as decreased sales in guam were more than offset by sales increases in a majority of our other stores 
additionally  although we are experiencing a decline in sales in guam as a result of a new competitor  we expect our sales volume in guam to rebound somewhat as they did when the same competitor entered our st 
thomas market in fiscal however  on december   our two stores on the island of guam suffered damage from supertyphoon pongsona  resulting in the immediate closure of both stores 
our tamuning store lost its generator in the storm  but reopened shortly thereafter on december th 
our dededo store  however  suffered more significant damage  and has yet to reopen 
we believe that the building structure is most likely a total loss and we are in the process of rebuilding our dededo store with an expected reopening in late although the supertyphoon in guam had only a slightly adverse effect on our fiscal sales  we expect sales in guam in to be negatively impacted as a result of the temporary closure of our dededo store 
gross margin 
gross margin improved to million  or of sales  in fiscal from million  or of sales  in fiscal the increase in gross profit as a percent of sales resulted primarily from improvements in merchandising and a stronger mix of retail store sales  with typically higher margins  as compared to business to business sales  which generally provide a lower gross margin but are executed at minimal direct expense 
store expenses 
store expenses increased to million for fiscal as compared to million in fiscal as a percentage of sales  store expenses increased to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the increase in store expenses was primarily due to higher payroll and related costs associated with an upgrade in store management  higher sales volume and a higher level of customer service  as well as increases in repairs and maintenance expense and credit card fees  offset by an improvement in utility expenses 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expenses remained relatively flat at million  or of sales  in fiscal  as compared to million  or of sales  in fiscal store opening expense 
store opening expenses were  in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal store opening expenses in both years relate to costs associated with the evaluation of potential new store locations 
net interest expense 
net interest expense decreased to  in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal  due primarily to a reduction in interest rates 
other income expense other expense of  in fiscal includes expense of  related to uninsured losses sustained from the supertyphoon in guam and gains of  on foreign currency transactions  and translation of intercompany balances for transactions that exceed the permanent investments in those countries 
other expense of  in fiscal  was primarily attributable to losses on foreign currency transactions  and translation of intercompany balances for transactions that exceed the permanent investments in those countries 
the income and expense on foreign currency in both fiscal years is primarily attributable to appreciation and depreciation in the fijian dollar as compared to the us dollar 
income tax provision 
we recorded a tax provision in fiscal of million or of pre tax income 
the tax provision represents taxes associated with income generated in the us and us territories 
no taxes or tax benefits were provided on foreign pre tax losses in fiscal  as we cannot predict whether we will be able to generate an adequate amount of taxable income in the future to utilize such benefits 
as of december   we had foreign net operating loss carryforwards nol s of approximately million  which  if not utilized  will begin expiring in the year nol s in australia  curacao and st 
maarten of approximately million are not subject to expiration time limits 
our ability to utilize the nol carryforwards is dependent upon generating taxable income in the foreign jurisdictions 
as a result  we have recorded a valuation allowance of million attributable to the net operating loss carryforwards 
we had foreign tax credit carryforwards of million as of december   expiring between and during fiscal  we were able to utilize most of the foreign tax credit carryforwards 
we expect to be able to fully utilize the remaining foreign tax credit carryforward of million and  therefore  no valuation allowance is provided 
net income 
our net income decreased to  or per share  for fiscal  compared to net income of  or per share in fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales in fiscal of million declined as compared to net sales of million for the comparable period in the prior year 
excluding the million of sales attributable to the additional week in fiscal  sales for fiscal decreased as compared to fiscal comparable store sales stores open at least months decreased during fiscal as compared to fiscal the decline in total sales and comparable store sales is primarily due to the impact of deteriorating economies in guam  samoa and curacao  netherlands antilles  as well as the impact of a competitor opening a membership warehouse club in st 
thomas in may sales from our st 
maarten store  opened in june of  and an increase in business sales more than offset the impact of the loss of sales from the two unprofitable new zealand stores that were closed in june and the unprofitable nadi  fiji store that was closed in february gross margin 
gross margin improved to million  or of sales  in fiscal from million  or of sales  in fiscal the increase in gross profit as a percent of sales was primarily due to improvements in store operations and merchandising  as well as from the elimination of low margin sales in the new zealand and fiji stores that were closed in mid and early  respectively 
store expenses 
store expenses decreased million in fiscal to million from million in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to the closure of the new zealand stores 
as a percent of sales  store expenses increased slightly to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase as a percent of sales was primarily due to increased utility  insurance  bad debt and bank fee expenses 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expenses decreased million in fiscal to million compared to million in fiscal general and administrative expenses were of sales in fiscal  compared to in fiscal the decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the closure of our buying office in auckland  new zealand in june additionally  we expensed million of obsolete equipment in june store opening expense 
store opening expenses decreased million to million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal store opening expenses in fiscal related to costs associated with the evaluation of potential new store locations 
fiscal store opening expenses were related to our st 
maarten store that opened in june store closing expense 
store closing expenses of million in fiscal  primarily related to the closing of our new zealand stores in june and the accruals established for the february closing of our nadi  fiji store 
store closing expenses for fiscal also include a write off of approximately million of translation losses previously recorded in other comprehensive income  a component of shareholders equity 
we did not incur any material additional store closure expenses in fiscal related to our new zealand or fiji store closures 
net interest expense 
net interest expense decreased million to million in fiscal as additional interest expense from the long term borrowings for the construction of the building for the st 
maarten store that opened june  was more than offset by lower average borrowings on our line of credit and reduced interest rates 
other expense other expense of million in fiscal and million in fiscal was primarily attributable to gains and losses on foreign currency transactions 
income tax provision 
we recorded a tax provision in fiscal of million or of pre tax income 
the tax provision represents taxes associated with income generated in the us and us territories  off set by a bad debt deduction related to fiji 
no tax benefits were recognized on foreign pre tax losses in fiscal  as we cannot predict whether we will be able to generate an adequate amount of taxable income in the future to utilize such benefits 
during the years ended december  and december   we recorded foreign tax credits of million and million  respectively 
if not utilized  the foreign tax credits will expire in the years and  respectively 
utilization of the nol s and foreign tax credit carryforwards may be limited in any given year by alternative minimum tax amt restrictions  depending upon each year s amt calculation 
our ability to utilize various tax benefits is dependent upon generating taxable income in us and foreign jurisdictions 
as a result  we have recorded a valuation allowance of million at december   against the tax benefit of net operating loss and foreign tax credit carryforwards 
net income loss 
the net income for fiscal was million  or per fully diluted share  compared to a net loss of million  or per fully diluted share  for fiscal the net loss in fiscal resulted primarily from non recurring charges related to the closure of our two new zealand stores  new zealand operating losses and the write off of obsolete equipment 
liquidity and capital resources we currently finance our operations with proceeds from various credit facilities  and internally generated funds 
net cash provided by operations was million  million and million  for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the decrease in net cash provided by operations in as compared to was primarily due to the establishment of a receivable for assets lost as a result of supertyphoon pongsona in guam and use of cash to reduce accrued expenses 
the decrease in net cash provided by operations in compared to was primarily due to an increase in inventory  as our inventory levels at the end of fiscal were lower than we prefer due to an over achievement of our inventory reduction program implemented during the fourth quarter of  and a reduction in our store closure reserve 
net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million  for fiscal years  and  respectively 
cash was used in fiscal and fiscal for general store improvements 
the cash used in investing activities in primarily relates to the opening of our st 
maarten store 
currently  we have no plans to open new stores during other than rebuilding our dededo  guam store 
however  we continue to analyze opportunities for new stores in the future 
net cash used by financing activities of million in fiscal was due to reductions in the outstanding borrowings on our long term debt  partially offset by additional borrowings on our line of credit 
in fiscal  the million of net cash used by financing activities was due to the reduction of both our line of credit and our long term debt 
the million of net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal was primarily due to proceeds from long term debt used to finance the construction of our st 
maarten store that opened june  foreign currency translation resulted in a gain of  in fiscal and losses of million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
the foreign currency translation gains and losses are a result of the translation of our subsidiaries operating results and balance sheets from local currencies to u 
s 
dollars 
in fiscal  we wrote off million of foreign currency translation losses as a result of the substantial liquidation of our new zealand operations 
on october   we amended the terms of our line of credit with a financial institution to extend the term of the line of credit to april   to reduce the amount of the line from million to million  and to change the interest rate on the line of credit to the prime rate plus a through and including january   b from january  through and including february   c from february  through and including march   and d from march  and thereafter 
no fixed rate loans are available under the amended line of credit  except that the million of fixed rate loans existing on the date of the amendment will continue until the end of the their respective interest rate periods and thereafter bear interest with reference to the prime rate 
the prime rate was at at december  at december   we had million in borrowings outstanding on our line of credit and million utilized for standby letters of credit 
the lender informed us that it would terminate this credit facility as of april   but it subsequently extended the terms of the credit facility until we were able to secure a replacement facility 
as of april   this line of credit has been satisfied and has been terminated 
on april   we entered into a replacement line of credit with a different financial institution that has a three year term  expiring on april  the new line of credit consists of a million committed  secured revolving credit line with a sublimit for letters of credit and bankers acceptances in the amount up to million 
borrowings are limited to the lesser of million or the amount calculated under the borrowing base 
the borrowing base is calculated as a percentage of our inventory located in the united states and the us territories 
borrowings under the replacement line of credit bear interest at the financial institution s prime rate plus 
a fee of will be charged on the unused portion of the line of credit 
the replacement line of credit contains various covenants  including a requirement that we maintain minimum pre tax income and tangible net worth and limitations on acquisitions  additional debt  change in control and capital expenditures 
we believe that we are currently in compliance with all such covenants 
in november  we entered into a million note payable for the construction of our new store in st 
maarten 
the note payable carries interest at the prime rate plus at december   and is secured by a first security interest on our st 
maarten leasehold interest and personal property 
a significant portion of our cash flow is generated by our operations 
if our operating results deteriorate  as a result of a decrease in customer demand or severe pricing pressures from our customers or our competitors  our ability to generate positive cash flow from operations may be jeopardized 
we believe that amounts available under our various credit facilities  existing cash available for working capital purposes  and cash flow from operations will most likely be sufficient to fund our operations through the next months 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing when needed  or that any available financing will be on terms acceptable to us 
contractual obligations as of december   our commitments to make future payments under long term contractual obligations were as follows in thousands payments due by period less than to to after contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt   operating leases      total      critical accounting policies we have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to report accurately and fairly our operating results and financial position  and we apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner 
the significant accounting policies are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical in the preparation of our financial statements because they involve the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
inventories inventories are carried at the lower of average cost or market 
we provide for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts on the basis of a percentage of sales 
the provision is adjusted periodically to reflect the trend of actual physical inventory count results 
foreign currency translation the us dollar is the functional currency for all our locations  except for fiji and netherlands antilles  where the local currency is the functional currency 
prior to the closure of our new zealand stores in june  the functional currency for new zealand was its local currency 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the applicable exchange rate on the balance sheet date 
net sales costs and expenses are translated at the average rates of exchange prevailing during the period 
adjustments resulting from this process are reported  net of taxes  as accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a component of shareholders equity 
realized and unrealized gains on foreign currency transactions are included in other income expense 
the cumulative translation adjustment resulting from a net investment in a country is recognized as income or expense in the period we substantially liquidated operations in that country 
stock based compensation we have elected to apply the disclosure only provisions of financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
accordingly  we account for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations under apb no 
 whereby compensation cost for stock options is measured as the excess  if any  of the fair value of our common stock at the date of grant over the stock option exercise price 
we generally grant stock options at exercise prices equal to fair market value on the date of grant  as a result  no compensation cost is recognized 
income taxes income tax expense includes us and foreign income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the liability method 
under the liability method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities  and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
we apply judgment in determining whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized  and valuation allowances are established when necessary 
our effective tax rate is currently higher than the expected federal statutory rate because valuation allowances have been established against the tax benefits of foreign losses  as we have no assurance that we will be able to generate an adequate amount of taxable income in the future to utilize such benefits 
we are developing and implementing certain tax planning strategies  which may affect our ability to recognize some of the deferred tax assets that are currently allowed for and may ultimately change our estimate of the valuation allowance

the emerging issues task force released issue no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor in november  applicable to the company for arrangements entered into beginning in fiscal the company records vendor allowances and discounts in the income statement when the purpose for which those monies were designated is fulfilled 
as such  the company does not expect the release to have a significant effect on its results of operations or financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we operate stores in foreign countries and have market risks associated with foreign currencies 
however  sales are primarily made in us cash or foreign currencies with minimal trade credit extended and no borrowings exist in foreign currencies 
cash deposited from sales are remitted back to the us bank account  routinely 
we record gains and losses on foreign currency transactions  and translation of intercompany balances for transactions that exceed the permanent investments in those countries in other income expense 
gains and losses are primarily attributable to appreciation and depreciation in the fijian dollar as compared to the us dollar 
we have also assessed our vulnerability to interest rate risk associated with our financial instruments  including  cash and cash equivalents  lines of credit and long term debt 
due to the nature of these financial instruments  we believe that the risk associated with interest rate fluctuations does not pose a material risk 
our line of credit and long term debt can be expected to vary in the future as a result of future business requirements  market conditions and other factors 
we do not have any derivative financial instruments as of december
