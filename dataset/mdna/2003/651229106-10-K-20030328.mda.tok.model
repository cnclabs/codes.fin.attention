the direct charge to stockholders equity did not affect net income  but is included in other comprehensive income 
the company remains confident that its pension plan has the appropriate long term investment strategy and the company s liquidity position is expected to remain strong 
critical accounting policies the company s accounting policies are more fully described in footnote to the consolidated financial statements 
as disclosed in footnote  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying footnotes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to the consolidated financial statements 
the following sections describe the company s critical accounting policies 
goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets effective january   the company adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but remain subject to periodic impairment tests in accordance with the statements 
the company conducts its annual test of impairment for goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets in the third quarter 
in addition  the company tests for impairment periodically if events or circumstances occur subsequent to the company s annual impairment tests that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
in conducting this impairment test  the company estimates the future cash flows of its businesses to which the goodwill and other indefinite life intangibles relate 
these cash flows are then discounted at rates ranging from to  reflecting the respective specific industry s cost of capital 
the discounted cash flows are then compared to the carrying amount of the reporting unit to determine if an impairment exists 
if  upon review  the fair value is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit  the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value 
reporting units are typically operating segments or operations one level below operating segments for which discrete financial information is available and for which segment management regularly reviews the operating results 
because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for the reporting units  the fair value usually is based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved in the asset group 
the expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on judgmental assessments of future production volumes  prices and costs  considering all available information at the date of review 
as a result of this analysis  the company recorded a pre tax goodwill impairment charge of million in the first quarter of with an after tax charge totaling million 
the accounting estimate related to goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets is highly susceptible to change from period to period because it requires management to make estimates of future cash flows and changes in cost of capital related to each of its business units 
there is potential for economic  regulatory  or other conditions that could adversely affect the ability of each business unit to generate future cash flows 
should these conditions deteriorate  there is the potential for additional impairment losses to be incurred  and such losses could be material to the company s consolidated financial statements 
legal and environmental reserves as described in footnote to the company s consolidated financial statements  the company is involved in legal proceedings in the ordinary course of its business 
these proceedings include claims for damages arising out of use of the company s products  allegations of infringement of intellectual property  commercial disputes and employment matters as well as environmental matters 
some of the legal proceedings include claims for punitive as well as compensatory damages  and a few proceedings purport to be class actions 
in determining the appropriate level of legal reserves  the company uses outside and internal counsel to evaluate the potential exposure on specific claims 
the company evaluates the range of estimated loss for each specific case and determines the probable exposure based on historical experience and the advice of counsel 
while the company believes it is adequately reserved for legal exposures  management cannot predict with certainty the ultimate outcome of these cases  including any amounts it may be required to pay in excess of amounts reserved 
the ultimate outcome of these cases could exceed the amounts recorded and such losses could be material to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company is involved in various matters concerning federal and state environmental laws and regulations  including matters in which the company has been identified by the us environmental protection agency and certain state environmental agencies as a potentially responsible party prp at contaminated sites under the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla and equivalent state laws 
in assessing its environmental response costs  the company has considered several factors  including the extent of the company s volumetric contribution at each site relative to that of other prps  the kind of waste  the terms of existing cost sharing and other applicable agreements  the financial ability of other prps to share in the payment of requisite costs  the company s prior experience with similar sites  environmental studies and cost estimates available to the company  the effects of inflation on cost estimates  and the extent to which the company s and other parties status as prps is disputed 
the company s estimate of environmental response costs associated with these matters as of december  ranged between million and million 
as of december   the company had a reserve equal to million for such environmental response costs in the aggregate 
no insurance recovery was taken into account in determining the company s cost estimates or reserve  nor do the company s cost estimates or reserve reflect any discounting for present value purposes  except with respect to two long term year operations and maintenance cercla matters which are estimated at present value 
because of the uncertainties associated with environmental investigations and response activities  the possibility that the company could be identified as a prp at sites identified in the future that require the incurrence of environmental response costs and the possibility of additional sites as a result of businesses acquired  actual costs to be incurred by the company may vary from the company s estimates 
the ultimate outcome of these matters may exceed the amounts recorded by the company and such additional losses may be material to the company s consolidated financial statements 
product liability reserves the company has a self insurance program for product liability that includes reserves for self retained losses and certain excess and aggregate risk transfer insurance 
the company uses historical loss experience combined with actuarial evaluation methods  review of significant individual files  application of risk transfer programs  and guidance from internal and external legal counsel in determining required product liability reserves 
as a result of the most recent analysis  the company has estimated these reserves at million 
while the company believes that it has adequately reserved for these claims  the ultimate outcome of these matters may exceed the amounts recorded by the company and such additional losses may be material to the company s consolidated financial statements 
recovery of accounts receivable the company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
when aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position  the company records a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount the company reasonably believes is collectible 
the company also records reserves for bad debt for all other customers based on a variety of factors  including the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience 
if circumstances related to specific customers change  the company s estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted 
inventory reserves the company reduces its inventory value for estimated obsolete and slow moving inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenues and freight billed to customers  net of provisions for cash discounts  returns  volume or trade customer discounts  co op advertising and other sales discounts  upon shipment to customers when all substantial risks of ownership change 
in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf no 
 accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs  the company records amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling as revenue and all expenses related to shipping and handling as a cost of products sold

the company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes 
the company s primary market risk is interest rate exposure  primarily in the united states

interest rate swaps may be used to adjust interest rate exposures when appropriate based on market conditions  and  for qualifying hedges  the interest differential of swaps is included in interest expense 
the company s foreign exchange risk management policy emphasizes hedging anticipated intercompany and third party commercial transaction exposures of one year duration or less 
the company focuses on natural hedging techniques of the following form offsetting or netting of like foreign currency cash flows  structuring foreign subsidiary balance sheets with appropriate levels of debt to reduce subsidiary net investments and subsidiary cash flows subject to conversion risk  converting excess foreign currency deposits into us dollars or the relevant functional currency and avoidance of risk by denominating contracts in the appropriate functional currency 
in addition  the company utilizes short term forward contracts to hedge commercial and intercompany transactions 
gains and losses related to qualifying hedges of commercial and intercompany transactions are deferred and included in the basis of the underlying transactions 
derivative instruments are recorded on the company s consolidated balance sheet at fair value  and any changes in fair value of these instruments are recorded in the consolidated statement of income or other comprehensive income 
due to the diversity of its product lines  the company does not have material sensitivity to any one commodity 
the company manages commodity price exposures primarily through the duration and terms of its vendor contracts 
the amounts shown below represent the estimated potential economic loss that the company could incur from adverse changes in either interest rates or foreign exchange rates using the value at risk estimation model 
the value at risk model uses historical foreign exchange rates and interest rates to estimate the volatility and correlation of these rates in future periods 
it estimates a loss in fair market value using statistical modeling techniques and including substantially all market risk exposures specifically excluding equity method investments 
the fair value losses shown in the table below do not have an impact on current results of operations or financial condition  but are shown as an illustration of the impact of potential adverse changes in interest rates 
the following table indicates the calculated amounts for each of the years ended december  and in millions december  december  confidence market risk average average level interest rates foreign exchange the confidence interval signifies the company s degree of confidence that actual losses would not exceed the estimated losses shown above 
the amounts shown here disregard the possibility that interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates could move in the company s favor 
the value at risk model assumes that all movements in these rates will be adverse 
actual experience has shown that gains and losses tend to offset each other over time  and it is highly unlikely that the company could experience losses such as these over an extended period of time 
these amounts should not be considered projections of future losses  because actual results may differ significantly depending upon activity in the global financial markets
