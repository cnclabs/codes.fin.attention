overview we are the leading provider of advanced technology solutions for identity verification 
we began operations in  providing integrated solutions to capture facial images  demographic information and other biological identifiers  produce identification cards and create relational databases containing this information 
since our inception  we have also been acquiring and developing proprietary facial recognition technologies for a variety of applications 
applications can include driver s licenses  voter registration  national identification cards  law enforcement  social services  access control and pc network and internet access security 
our primary customers have been government agencies with particular penetration in departments of motor vehicles 
we have captured approximately of the domestic driver s license market 
our products annually produce more than million identification documents at more than  locations in states 
we have also provided services under subcontracts for projects in jamaica  the philippines and for the us immigration and naturalization service 
originally developed at mit  face recognition technology is widely recognized as the most convenient  non intrusive and cost effective biometric available 
in  we completed three acquisitions through which we enhanced our portfolio of facial recognition technologies and acquired customers and distribution channels 
our patented face recognition technology is focused on three major product application areas 

table of contents faceexplorer  our technology for image retrieval and analysis  is recognized for its leadership technology performance in real time and large database applications 
faceexplorer is deployed in the world s largest face recognition application with a database of more than million enrolled images and is growing by  new images per day 
facepass for physical access control and keyless entry  and facefinder for surveillance and identification 
segments our business involves two related segments secure identification and facial recognition 
substantially all of our revenues have been derived within the united states of america 
secure identification segment our secure identification segment accounted for approximately  and of our revenues in  and  respectively 
secure identification involves the development  marketing and sale of integrated software and hardware solutions that produce identification cards utilizing facial recognition and other biometrics 
we provide systems and services principally under contracts that have five to seven year terms and several optional annual renewals after the initial contract term 
contracts generally provide for a fixed price for the system and or for each identification card produced 
contract prices vary depending on  among other things  design and integration complexities  the nature and number of workstations and sites  the projected number of cards to be produced  the size of the database  the level of post installation support and the competitive environment 
facial recognition segment our facial recognition segment accounted for approximately  and of total revenues in  and respectively 
approximately of our facial recognition revenues in were derived from casino surveillance applications  the remaining were derived from applications designed to deter criminal and terrorist activities  including government research and development contracts 
acquisitions on january   we acquired the assets of lau security systems  a division of lau technologies  including all of its intellectual property  contracts and distribution channels 
the intellectual property acquired from lau included  among other things twenty four us or foreign patent grants or applications for inventions relating to facial recognition technologies or the production of identification cards  
table of contents the patent acquired by lau from daozeng lu and simon lu for verifying the identity of an individual using identification parameters carried on an escort memory  and numerous invention disclosures that are being considered for patent application 
the transaction also included an exclusive license of lau s rights to use the patented facial recognition technology it licensed from mit for use in the federal access control field 
as a result of this transaction  certain obligations on the part of viisage to license intellectual property to lau were terminated 
we agreed to pay lau a royalty of of the facial recognition revenues over twelve and a half years  up to a maximum of million and assume certain liabilities related to the acquired business 
as the transaction was between related parties  the assets have been recorded based on a historical cost basis 
the estimated excess of the assets acquired over liabilities assumed has been recorded as additional paid in capital 
the royalty payments are recorded as an expense as they are incurred and not added to the purchase price  as the royalty contains no minimum amount 
on march   we acquired the capital stock of biometrica systems  inc  or biometrica  a former licensee and distributor of viisage s facial recognition technologies in the casino market for approximately million in cash and additional earn out payments equal to of revenues as defined through biometrica s assets included  among other things  intellectual property relating to the biometricam  a compact camera with built in facial recognition software 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase  and accordingly  the operations of biometrica are included in the financial statements since the effective date  the close of business on march  the purchase price has been allocated to net assets acquired based on their estimated fair values 
we have recorded approximately  in amortization related to the acquired intangible assets from the date of the acquisition through december  on june   we acquired all of the intellectual property and related assets of the miros division of etrue 
com  a face recognition firm with customer installations across the globe  for approximately  in cash 
in addition to acquiring patented technology  including miros trueface software  we also gained access to an established customer base and new distribution channels 
potential acquisition on march   we entered into a securities purchase agreement with zn vision technologies ag  a german provider of facial recognition and computer vision technologies  and all of the shareholders of zn 
pursuant to the securities purchase agreement  the zn shareholders agreed to sell  and we agreed to purchase  all of the capital stock of zn 
as consideration for the shares of zn  we will pay approximately  in cash and an aggregate of  shares of our common stock  of which  shares will be issued directly to the zn shareholders and  shares will be reserved for issuance under zn s option plan  which we will assume upon the closing of the acquisition 
following the closing of the acquisition  zn will become a wholly owned subsidiary of viisage and serve as the base of our european operations 
the acquisition is expected to be completed in july in accordance with nasdaq rules  the issuance of shares of our common stock in connection with the acquisition must be approved by our stockholders 
we expect to file with the securities and exchange commission  or the sec  during the month of april a preliminary proxy statement seeking such stockholder approval 
following review by the sec  we will mail the proxy statement to our stockholders and convene a special meeting of stockholders to obtain such stockholder approval 
impact of timing of contract awards and contract performance in our secure identification segment our results of operations are significantly affected by  among other things  the timing of awards and performance on contracts 
as a result  our revenues and income may fluctuate from quarter to quarter  and comparisons over longer periods may be more meaningful 
our results of operations are not seasonal since contracts are awarded and performed throughout the year 
however  we believe our public sector business is subject to cyclical procurement delays that may be related to election cycles 
dependence on significant customers we believe for the near future that we will continue to derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of large contracts 
for the years ended december  secure identification segment customers who accounted for more than of revenues in a given years are as follows for  two customers accounted for an aggregate of for  four customers accounted for an aggregate of 
table of contents for  four customers accounted for an aggregate of no single facial recognition customer accounted for over of total revenue in any one year 
critical accounting policies we prepare our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
consistent with generally accepted accounting principles  we have adopted accounting policies that we believe are most appropriate given the facts and circumstances of our business 
the application of these policies has a significant impact on our reported results 
in addition  some of these policies require management to make estimates 
these estimates  which are based on historical experience and analysis of current conditions  have a significant impact on our reported results and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  there could be a material effect on our financial statements 
secure identification contract revenue and cost recognition our most significant contracts are our driver s license contracts  which are within our secure identification segment 
these contracts typically provide that the state department of transportation  or similar agency  will pay us a fixed price for each system we install and for each identification card produced under the system 
prices under these contracts vary depending on  among other things design and integration complexities  the nature and number of workstations and sites installed  the projected number of cards to be produced  the size of the database  the level of post installation involvement that will be required of us  and the competitive environment 
we recognize revenue under these contracts using the percentage of completion method 
we use the percentage of completion method to account for revenue under these contracts because a high level of certainty exists regarding expected cash flows from these contracts  and a reliable basis exists for determining the percentage of the contract that will be completed at the end of the accounting period 
using the percentage of completion method  we recognize a percentage of the revenue we expect to receive under the contract based on the percentage of labor costs we incur and cards we produce 
although these contracts typically have a term of years or longer and include possible renewal terms  we incur most of the labor costs under these contracts within the first months of the contract 
accordingly  we recognize a substantial portion of the revenue under these contracts within the first months of the contract 

table of contents generally  we bill under these contracts when contract milestones  such as installation  are met and as cards are produced 
we recognize losses  if any  under these contracts in the period in which they become determinable 
we record costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings under these contracts as current assets 
we record billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings and accrued contract costs as current liabilities 
estimates of revenues under secure identification contracts we account for revenue from our driver s license contracts using the percentage of completion method 
revenues under these contracts are based on completion of installation and the number of cards produced 
we estimate the amount of time it will take to install the systems and the number of cards that will be produced 
in arriving at these estimates  we undertake a quarterly review of historical trends as to the volume of cards produced 
in addition  we consider factors that could impact the volume of production  such as legislative changes to the life of identification credentials  and state government funding levels 
we also take into consideration the fact that  although it has never occurred  one of our contracts could be terminated for reasons such as lack of performance 
if our estimates as to labor costs  consumable inventory levels  maintenance costs or the volume of cards that will be produced are materially incorrect  it could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
management has discussed the use and impact of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
results of operations year ended december  and revenues are derived principally from multi year contracts for system implementation  card production and related services 
revenue increased to million in from million in revenues in the secure identification segment increased by million  or  primarily as a result of winning new drivers license contracts 
revenues in the facial recognition segment increased by million  or  due to revenues generated from acquisitions and the continued growth of the facial recognition business 
the combined facial recognition revenue from the two segments increased by million  or from million in to million in gross margins decreased to in from in the decline in gross margin primarily reflects a change in product mix and contracts that included product development as well as delays in contract awards 
this is evident by the improvement in gross margins from the st quarter of of to in the th quarter of sales and marketing expenses increased by approximately million in from this represents an increase to from of revenue 
the increase is primarily due to our investment in pursuing facial recognition opportunities as a result of september  and the 
table of contents pursuit of significant opportunities in the secure identification marketplace 
the result of this investment can be seen in the increase to our revenue  backlog  and customer base 
we expect to continue this investment in sales and marketing 
research and development expenses increased by approximately million in from this represents an increase to from of revenue 
the increase is due principally to our continued investment in facial recognition technologies and new product development 
this included enhancing existing products with the intellectual property that was acquired through the recent acquisitions 
we expect to continue to invest in product development as the market for our products continues to expand in fiscal general and administrative expenses increased by approximately million in from this represents an increase to from of revenue 
this increase was largely due to additional rental costs of approximately  due to additional leased space and an increased rental rate on previously occupied space  and a write down of a contract receivable of  as a result of the acquisitions in  and to facilitate the growth of the business  we also increased investment in infrastructure and personnel 
we incurred a one time restructuring charge of  in the fourth quarter of this consisted of approximately  associated with a workforce reduction of individuals or approximately of the employee base 
in addition  we took a charge for non cancelable lease costs and capital equipment of approximately  and  respectively 
annualized savings associated with the workforce reduction are expected to total approximately million 
interest expense decreased approximately  in from this represents a decrease to from of revenue 
this decrease reflects the impact of our continuing efforts to reduce our overall debt and related interest expense  as well as the ability to pay down a  operating line of credit with the proceeds of the million private placement of common stock in december we did not record any tax for fiscal years and due to the net loss in each year 
year ended december  and revenues are derived principally from multi year contracts for system implementation  card production and related services 
revenue decreased to million in from million in the decrease in revenue between the two years was primarily the result of customer delays in the state of pennsylvania and maryland 
gross margins increased to in from in the increase in gross margins between the two years is due principally to the positive impact of new business with higher margins and the positive effect of contract extensions on the overall revenue mix in sales and marketing expenses increased by or million in from this represents an increase to from of revenue 
the increase is due principally to our continuing efforts in marketing our patented biometric solutions as we continue to increase our distribution and marketing capabilities for our facial recognition solutions by adding and certifying 
table of contents new system integrators and reseller partners 
this allows us to control our costs while increasing our marketing capabilities 
research and development expenses increased by or million in from this represents an increase to from of revenue 
the increase is due principally to our continued investment in biometrics 
research and development costs do not include amounts for specific projects that are allocated to cost of revenues  and do not reflect the benefits to us under license arrangements from the research and development efforts of lau technologies and the massachusetts institute of technology for projects that are not directly related to us 
general and administrative expenses remained relatively unchanged between and this represents an increase to from of revenue 
the increase as a percentage of revenue is due to the slight decrease in business volume and resulting revenues from to we incurred fourth quarter one time expenses of million related to costs incurred in our attempt to purchase polaroid corporation s identification systems business in the fourth quarter of these expenses related to legal and professional activities for due diligence as well as financing break up fees associated with this unsuccessful acquisition 
interest expense decreased million in from this represents a decrease to from of revenue 
this decrease reflects a reduction in borrowings during we did not record any tax for the fiscal year due to the net loss for the year 
for the fiscal year  no tax was incurred due to the availability of tax loss carry forwards 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents were million at december   which consisted entirely of cash 
this number excludes approximately million which is restricted under our term loan agreements and project financing 
in the current year we had an operating cash loss of approximately million  which stems primarily from our net loss of approximately million  offset by non cash charges for depreciation and amortization of million and non cash expenses for services paid in common stock of accounts receivable increased approximately from december  to december  this was the result of the increase to revenue and accounts receivable related to acquisitions  as well as the timing of billings  which liquidated a portion of the costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings 
costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings increased approximately from december  to december   which reflects the billing of accumulated contract costs incurred in prior periods 
accounts payable and accrued expenses increased approximately from december  to december  this was the result of the increase to revenue  accounts payable related to acquisitions  as well as the timing of payables 

table of contents our investing activities used cash of approximately million primarily due to the reclassification of cash to restricted cash of million and the purchase of property and equipment of million for system assets 
additionally  million was used for facial recognition business acquisitions 
in december  we entered into a new loan agreement with a bank that supercedes the original loan agreement for the term loans 
the new loan agreement includes the prior term loans and provided for three new term notes aggregating million related to three new state contracts 
the new term notes in the amounts of million  million  and million bear interest at the rate of 
the following table lists the approximate term note information as of december  in thousands original loan amount principal balance monthly payment provisions date of loan due date of loan interest rate total in accordance with the new loan agreement the term notes are collateralized by certain of our assets and the related contract assets 
we are required to maintain various financial covenants  including profitability by quarter as defined  tangible net worth  debt to worth ratio  debt service coverage and limits on capital expenditures 
additionally  in accordance with the new agreement we must maintain million of cash on deposit with the lender 
this amount is recorded as restricted cash in long term assets 
in december  we amended the two system project lease financing arrangements with commercial leasing organizations 
pursuant to these arrangements  the lessor purchases certain of our digital identification systems and leases them back to us for deployment with identified and contracted customers approved by the lessor 
the lessor retains title to systems and has an assignment of our rights under the related customer contracts  including rights to use the software and technology underlying the related systems 
under these arrangements  the lessor bears the credit risk associated with payments by our customers  but we bear performance and appropriation risk and are generally required to repurchase a system in the event of a termination by a customer for any reason except credit default 
in accordance with one project financing arrangement we are also required to maintain certain financial ratios and minimum levels of tangible capital funds  as defined 
these project lease arrangements are accounted for as capital leases 
at december  and  we had approximately million and million outstanding under these lease financing arrangements respectively 
there are no financial covenant requirements under one of the project financing arrangements as we were required to pledge cash as collateral security to be maintained at the bank equal to the outstanding debt balance 
the collateral shall remain in control of the lender  and these funds can be used to satisfy the outstanding obligation of approximately million at december  accordingly  we had cash at the bank of approximately million at 
table of contents december   of which million is recorded as restricted cash in current assets equal to current obligations and million is included in restricted cash in long term assets 
at december of each year  approximate future minimum lease payments under project financing capital leases  operating leases and principal maturities of term notes are as follows in thousands capital leases term notes operating leases year ending total minimum payments less interest portion present value of net minimum lease payments less current portion long term portion we were in compliance with all debt covenants as of december  we believe that we will remain in compliance with the amended debt covenants 
however  this expectation is dependent on achieving our business plan 
if we do not meet such covenants  the bank and the lessors could require immediate repayment of outstanding amounts 
during  our board of directors received an aggregate of  shares of common stock in addition to  in cash compensation 
the fair market value of the common stock on the grant date was approximately  and was expensed during the year ended december  in february  lau technologies exercised a warrant to purchase  shares of common stock at per share  which resulted in cash proceeds of  pursuant to an agreement entered into with us in under which lau guaranteed a contract indemnification obligation of ours 
in january   shares of common stock with a total value of approximately  were issued to an investment bank  in association with a common stock placement on december  during  approximately  shares were issued as a result of the exercise of stock options resulting in cash proceeds of approximately we believe that if we meet our business forecast for  cash flows from available borrowings  project leasing  operations and capital raised will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for the foreseeable future 
new contract awards may require us to seek additional financing 
our ability to meet our business forecast is dependent on a number of factors  including those described below under factors that may affect future results 
our cash liquidity is not immediately impacted  either positively or negatively  by changes to net income loss due to timing difference between revenue recognition and cash payments on long term contracts 

table of contents contingent obligations our principal contractual commitments involve payments under capital leases  term notes and operating leases 
inflation although certain of our expenses increase with general inflation in the economy  inflation has not had a material impact on our financial results to date 
recent accounting pronouncements in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
sfas requires that gains and losses from extinguishment of debt be classified as extraordinary items only if they meet the criteria in accounting principles board opinion no 
applying the provisions of opinion no 
will distinguish transactions that are part of an entity s recurring operations from those that are unusual and infrequent and meet the criteria for classification as an extraordinary item 
sfas no 
is effective beginning january  we do not believe the adoption of sfas no 
will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this standard requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
examples of costs covered by the standard include lease termination costs and certain employee severance costs that are associated with a restructuring  discontinued operation  plant closing  or other exit or disposal activity 
this standard will be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after december  we do not believe the adoption of sfas no 
will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we initiated and executed a restructuring plan in the fourth quarter of and  accordingly  recorded a restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of see note 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure fas  which i amends fas statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for an entity that voluntarily changes to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation ii amends the disclosure provisions of fas to require prominent disclosure about the effects on reported net income of an entity s accounting policy decisions with respect to stock based employee compensation and iii amends apb opinion no 
 interim financial reporting  to require disclosure about those effects in interim financial information 
items ii and iii of the new requirements in fas are effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after december  we have adopted the increased disclosure requirements of fas ii for the fiscal year ended december  we will continue to use the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 

table of contents factors that may affect future results the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties  including those not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial  may also impair our business 
we may be unable to obtain additional capital required to fund our operations and finance our growth 
the installation of our digital identification systems requires significant capital expenditures 
in addition  the further development of our biometric and other advanced technologies is expected to require additional capital 
although we completed a million private placement of our common stock at the end of and have been successful in the past in obtaining project financing  we will have ongoing capital needs as we expand our business 
if we are unable to obtain additional funds in a timely manner or on acceptable terms  we may not be able to fund our operations or expand our business to meet our plans 
if we are unable to obtain capital when we need it  we may have to restructure our business or delay or abandon our development and expansion plans 
that could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
our leverage creates financial and operating risk that could limit the growth of our business 
we have a significant amount of indebtedness 
as of december   we had approximately million in short and long term debt and lease financing 
our leverage could have important consequences to us including limiting our ability to obtain necessary financing for future working capital  limiting our ability to finance the acquisition of equipment needed to meet customer requirements  limiting our ability to finance the development of new technologies  requiring that we use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations for debt service and not other operating purposes  and requiring us to comply with financial and operating covenants  which could cause an event of default under our debt instruments 
further  our ability to make principal and interest payments under long term indebtedness and bank loans will be dependent upon our future performance  which is subject to financial  economic and other factors affecting us  some of which are beyond our control 
our business depends on large public sector contracts  which can involve delays 
our business depends on a limited number of large public sector contracts 
these contracts result from purchasing decisions made by public sector agencies that are often subject to political influence  onerous procurement procedures  budget changes and award protests 
these factors can cause delays  which make our quarterly results difficult to predict 
this can also make our ability to meet analysts expectations equally uncertain and adversely affect the price of our common stock 

table of contents our quarterly results could be volatile and may cause our stock price to fluctuate 
we have experienced fluctuations in our quarterly operating results and expect those fluctuations to continue 
our quarterly results are affected by  among other things  factors such as the size and timing of contract awards  the timing of our contract performance  variations in the mix of our products and services  and contract losses and changes in management estimates inherent to accounting for contracts 
the loss of any significant customer could cause our revenue to decline 
for the year ended december   two customers each accounted for over of our revenues and an aggregate of approximately of revenues 
for  four customers each accounted for over of our revenues and a total of approximately of our revenues for the year 
for  four customers each accounted for over of our revenues and a total of approximately of our revenues for the year 
the loss of any significant customer could cause our revenue to decline and thus have an adverse material effect on our business and financial condition 
we have a history of operating losses 
our business operations began in and  except for fiscal years and  have resulted in net losses in each fiscal year 
at december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we intend to continue to invest in the development of our biometrics technologies and thus we cannot predict when or if we will ever achieve overall profitability 
the market for our common stock has been volatile 
the market for stock of many security related businesses  including ours  has been highly volatile  especially since the terrorist attacks of september  it is likely that the market price of our common stock will fluctuate widely in the future 
factors affecting the trading price of our common stock are likely to include responses to quarter to quarter variations in our results of operations  the announcement of new contracts  products or product enhancements by us or our competitors  technological innovation by our competitors or us  general market conditions or market conditions specific to particular industries  and changes in earnings estimates by analysts 
our reliance on sole and single source suppliers could cause delays or increases in cost of revenues 
we rely on outside vendors to manufacture or develop components  software and consumables  which are used for our systems and services 
some of these items are obtained from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers 
our inability to obtain adequate deliveries or alternative sources of supply could cause delays or increases in cost of revenues 

table of contents if we do not successfully expand our direct sales and services organizations and partnering arrangements  we may not be able to increase our sales or support our customers 
in the fiscal years ended december  and  we licensed substantially all of our products through our direct sales organization 
our future success depends on substantially increasing the size and scope of our direct sales force and partnering arrangements  both domestically and internationally 
there is intense competition for personnel  and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to attract  assimilate or retain additional qualified sales personnel on a timely basis 
moreover  we believe that as our sales increase  and given the large scale deployment required by our customers  we will need to hire and retain a number of highly trained customer service and support personnel 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to increase the size of our customer service and support organization on a timely basis to provide the high quality of support required by our customers 
failure to add additional sales and customer service representatives would have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
if we lose any key personnel  or fail to attract and retain additional personnel  we may be unable to continue expanding our business and product line 
the loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to retain our key personnel 
our future success also depends on our continuing ability to attract  assimilate and retain highly qualified sales  technical and managerial personnel 
competition for these individuals is intense  and there can be no assurance that we can attract  assimilate or retain necessary personnel in the future 
if our target customers do not accept our biometric technologies  our growth may be restricted 
our growth plan assumes  in part  that biometric technologies will gain widespread market acceptance 
although we have had success with several recent biometric projects  the widespread market acceptance of biometric technologies remains uncertain 
if we fail to keep pace with changing technologies  we may not win new customers 
rapidly changing customer requirements and evolving industry standards characterize our market 
if we cannot keep pace with these changes  our business could suffer 
to achieve our goals  we need to develop cost effective business solutions and methodologies to keep pace with continuing changes in industry standards and customer preferences 
system failures could seriously damage our business 
we depend on our ability to provide customers with complex systems  which can operate on an as needed basis 
although we deploy back up systems  system failures could result in increased costs  lower margins  liquidated damage payment obligations and harm to our reputation 
this could result in contract terminations and have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

table of contents we are controlled by a single stockholder  which could result in it taking actions  which other stockholders do not approve 
lau technologies  or lau  beneficially owns approximately of our outstanding common stock 
as a result  lau has a strong influence on matters requiring approval by our stockholders  including the election of all of the directors and most corporate actions 
we have certain contractual relations with lau that could give rise to conflicts of interest 
competition from new entrants and bigger  more established competitors with greater financial resources could diminish our business opportunities and limit our growth 
the business areas in which we compete are intensely competitive and subject to rapid technological change 
we expect competition to continue 
in particular  the events of september  have heightened interest in the use of biometric technologies and competition in this field is expected to intensify 
there is no assurance that companies with greater financial resources and name recognition will not enter our business sectors 
our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to technological developments and changes in customers needs 
misappropriation of our intellectual property could harm our reputation  affect our competitive position and cost us money 
we believe our intellectual property  including our proprietary methodologies  is important to our success and competitive position 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property against others unauthorized use  our reputation among existing and potential customers could be damaged and our competitive position adversely affected 
our strategies to deter misappropriation could be undermined in light of the following risks non recognition of the proprietary nature of or inadequate protection of our methodologies in the united states or foreign countries  undetected misappropriation of our proprietary methodologies  and development of similar software or applications by our competitors 
the materialization of any of these risks could require us to spend significant amounts to defend our rights and could divert our managerial resources 
in addition  our proprietary methodologies may decline in value or our rights to them may be unenforceable 
others could claim that we infringe on their intellectual property rights  which may result in substantial costs  diversion of resources and management attention  and harm to our reputation 
although we believe that our products and services do not infringe the intellectual property rights of others  we cannot give any assurances that we can successfully defend an infringement claim 
a successful infringement claim against us could materially and adversely affect us in the following ways we may be liable for damages and litigation costs  including attorneys fees  we may be enjoined from further use of the intellectual property  we may have to license the intellectual property  incurring licensing fees  we may have to develop a non infringing alternative  which could be costly and delay projects  and we may have to indemnify clients with respect to losses incurred as a result of our infringement of the intellectual property 
regardless of the outcome  an infringement claim could result in substantial costs  diversion of resources and management attention  termination of customer contracts and harm to our reputation 

table of contents you may be subject to dilution 
we have outstanding stock purchase warrants and stock options that could result in dilution for our common stockholders  depending upon the market price of the company s common stock from time to time 
we may issue additional stock  warrants and options as part of an acquisition or financing transaction 
you should not expect dividends from us 
we do not expect to declare or pay any cash dividends in the near future
