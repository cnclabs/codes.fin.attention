the cost containment efforts resulted in reduced levels of research and development for the year ended december  as compared to the proceeds from the company s sale of its vena cava filter product to bard in november and the sale of the remainder of its neurosciences business unit in july have strengthened the company s financial position at december  and the increased balances of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities provide the company with greater flexibility to further invest in research and development  regulatory affairs and sales and marketing infrastructure and programs  as required  to maintain and grow its leadership position in the treatment of cardiac sources of stroke 
the company may periodically report non gaap pro forma results of operations as a complement to results provided in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap when the company believes that such information would provide a more meaningful measure of the actual and comparative results of the company s operating performance 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
however  certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal and understanding of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management 
as a result  these policies are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
in applying these policies  nmt s management uses its judgment in making certain assumptions and estimates 
our critical accounting policies include revenue recognition nmt recognizes revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 as amended by staff accounting bulletins a and b 
the company records product revenue when the following four basic criteria are satisfied persuasive evidence of an arrangement between nmt and a third party exists  title to the product has transferred to the customer and nmt has no significant post delivery obligations  the sales price for the product is fixed or determinable  and collection of the sales price is probable 
our management uses its judgment concerning the satisfaction of these criteria  particularly no 
relating to the collectability of the receivables relating to such sales 
in addition  products sold to the company s distributors are not subject to a right of return for unsold product 
should changes and conditions cause management to determine that these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any period could be adversely affected 
nmt recognizes license fees and royalties as they are earned in accordance with relevant contractual provisions 
note of notes to consolidated financial statements provides additional information relating to our accounting for vena cava filter product revenues under our transitional manufacturing agreement with bard 
accounts receivable we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and our assessment of the customer s current creditworthiness 
we continuously monitor collections from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions that we established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates in the future 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventories as a manufacturer of leading edge medical devices  the company may be exposed to a number of economic and industry factors that could result in portions of our inventory becoming either obsolete or in excess of anticipated usage 
these factors include  but are not limited to  technological changes in our markets  our ability to meet changing customer requirements  competitive pressures in products and prices  reliability and replacement of and the availability of key components from our suppliers 
the company s policy is to establish inventory reserves when conditions exist that suggest that our inventory may be in excess of anticipated demand or is obsolete based upon our assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions 
the company regularly evaluates the ability to realize the value of our inventory based on a combination of factors  including historical usage rates  forecasted sales or usage  product end of life dates  estimated current and future market values and new product introductions 
assumptions used in determining management s estimates of future product demand may prove to be incorrect  in which case the provision required for excess or obsolete inventory would have to be adjusted in the future 
if inventory is determined to be overvalued  the company would be required to recognize such costs as cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
although every effort is made to ensure the accuracy of management s forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have significant impact on the value of the company s inventory and the company s reported operating results 
additionally  purchasing requirements and alternative usage avenues are explored within these processes to mitigate inventory exposure 
when recorded  the company s reserves are intended to reduce the carrying value of our inventory to its net realizable value 
income taxes we account for income taxes under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue or installment sales  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent that we believe that recovery is not probable  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent that we establish a valuation allowance  or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of approximately  as of december   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits  before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  or if we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
the net deferred tax asset at december  was zero  net of the  valuation allowance 
legal contingencies we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings 
in connection with these legal proceedings  which we discuss in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  management periodically reviews estimates of potential costs to be incurred by the company in connection with the adjudication or settlement  if any  of these proceedings 
these estimates are developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based on an analysis of potential litigation outcomes and settlement strategies 
in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for contingencies  loss contingencies are accrued if  in the opinion of management  an adverse outcome is probable and such outcome can be reasonably estimated 
we do not believe that these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial position  however  it is possible that future results for any particular quarter or annual period may be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies relating to these proceedings 
results of operations year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenues 
revenues for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the year ended december  product sales increased to approximately million compared to million 
a million increase in cardioseal and starflex septal occluder product sales was partially offset by a million decrease in vena cava filter product sales 
the company believes that the increase in cardioseal and starflex sales resulted from i the growing awareness within the medical community that closing a pfo in certain stroke patients offers an alternative to ongoing drug therapy  ii the granting of a pma by the fda in december for the vsd indication  and iii an increase in its direct sales headcount during fiscal from to cardioseal and starflex product sales accounted for and of total product sales for the years ended december  and  respectively

included in cost of product sales are royalty expenses of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  related to acquired technologies and technology rights associated with some of the company s products 
the company expects cost of sales as a percentage of product sales to decrease slightly to approximately as a result of the elimination of any vena cava filter sales  partially offset by a step increase in royalty rates related to its cardioseal and starflex sales expected to commence by the end of the first quarter of fiscal research and development 
research and development expense increased  or million  to approximately million for the year ended december  from approximately million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily attributable to a combination of increased headcount and related personnel costs  contract product development for ongoing research and development programs related to cardioseal and starflex enhancements and accessories  next generation pfo closure platforms and research into the use of novel materials  and related patent legal costs

certain factors that may affect future results the following important factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward looking statements made in this annual report on form k and presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
substantially all of our revenues are derived from sales of one product line during and  we completed the divestiture of non strategic businesses through the sale of the vena cava filter product line to bard and the sale of the remainder of the neurosciences business unit to integra 
the company derives substantially all of its ongoing revenues from sales of our cardioseal and starflex products 
in the united states  the fda limits sales under an hde to  units per year 
as demand for  and costs associated with  these products fluctuates  including the potential impact of the company s planned non revenue producing pfo ide clinical trial on product sales  our financial results on a quarterly or annual basis may be significantly impacted 
accordingly  events or circumstances adversely affecting the sales of either of these products will directly and adversely impact our business 
these events or circumstances may include reduced demand for our products  lack of regulatory approvals  product liability claims and or increased competition 
we may face uncertainties with respect to commercialization  product development and market acceptance of our products 
before certain of our products can be marketed and sold in the united states  including our cardioseal and starflex products  we may be required to conduct further research  product development  preclinical and clinical testing and obtain additional governmental regulatory approvals 
despite the company s perception that there is growing awareness within the medical community that closing a pfo in certain stroke patients offers an alternative to ongoing drug therapy  we need to further validate this to the fda and the neurological community 
we cannot be certain that the company s planned significant investment in a pfo ide clinical trial closure i  to be commenced in and for which the company received conditional approval from the fda in march  will result in the receipt of a pma from the fda 
we cannot be certain that our current products  or products currently under development  will achieve or continue to have market acceptance 
certain of the medical indications that can be treated by our devices can also be treated by surgery  drugs or other medical devices 
currently  the medical community widely accepts many alternative treatments  and these other treatments have a long history of use 
we cannot be certain that our devices and procedures will be able to replace such established treatments or that either physicians or the medical community  in general  will accept and utilize our devices or any other medical products that we may develop 
in addition  our future success depends  in part  on our ability to develop additional products 
even if we determine that a product candidate has medical benefits  the cost of commercializing that product candidate may be too high to justify development 
in addition  competitors may develop products that are more effective  cost less or are ready for commercial introduction before our products 
if we are unable to develop additional  commercially viable products  our future prospects will be limited 
we may face challenges in executing our focused business strategy 
in connection with the commercialization of our cardioseal and starflex products  and the recent sales of our vena cava filter product line and our neurosciences business unit  we have focused our business growth strategy to concentrate on the manufacturing  marketing and selling of our cardiac septal repair devices 
our future sales growth and financial results depend almost exclusively upon the growth of sales of this product line 
cardioseal and starflex product sales may not grow as quickly as we expect for various reasons  including  but not limited to  delays in receiving further fda approvals  difficulties in recruiting additional experienced sales and marketing personnel and increased competition 
this focus has placed significant demands on our senior management team and other resources 
our future success will depend on our ability to manage and implement our focused business strategy effectively  including by achieving a successful starflex pfo ide clinical trial  improving our sales and marketing capabilities  continuing to train  motivate and manage our employees  and developing and improving our operational  financial and other internal systems 
we may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights and may face intellectual property infringement claims 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability to obtain patents  maintain trade secret protection and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties 
we cannot be certain that any pending patent applications or any future patent application will result in issued patents  the scope of any patent protection will exclude competitors or provide competitive advantages to us  any of our patents will be held valid if subsequently challenged  or others will not claim rights in or ownership of the patents and other proprietary rights held by us 
furthermore  we cannot be certain that others have not or will not develop similar products  duplicate any of our products or design around any patents issued  or that may be issued  in the future to us or to our licensors 
whether or not patents are issued to us or to our licensors  others may hold or receive patents which contain claims having a scope that covers products developed by us 
we could incur substantial costs in defending any patent infringement suits or in asserting any patent rights  including those granted by third parties 
in addition  we may be required to obtain licenses to patents or proprietary rights from third parties 
there can be no assurance that such licenses will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
our issued us patents  and corresponding foreign patents  expire at various dates ranging from to when each of our patents expires  competitors may develop and sell products based on the same or similar technologies as those covered by the expired patent 
we have invested in significant new patent applications and we cannot be certain that any of these applications will result in an issued patent to enhance the company s intellectual property rights 
our limited manufacturing history and the possibility of non compliance with manufacturing regulations raise uncertainties with respect to our ability to commercialize future products 
we have a limited history in manufacturing our products  including our cardioseal and starflex cardiac septal repair devices  and we may face difficulties as the commercialization of our products and the medical device industry changes 
increases in our manufacturing costs  or significant delays in our manufacturing process  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the fda and other regulatory authorities require that our products be manufactured according to rigorous standards including  but not limited to  good manufacturing practices and iso standards 
these regulatory requirements may significantly increase our production or purchasing costs and may even prevent us from making or obtaining our products in amounts sufficient to meet market demand 
if we or a third party manufacturer change our approved manufacturing process  the fda will require a new approval before that process could be used 
failure to develop our manufacturing capabilities may mean that even if we develop promising new products  we may not be able to produce them profitably  as a result of delays and additional capital investment costs 
we may be unable to successfully market our products due to limited marketing and sales experience 
our cardiac septal repair implant devices are marketed primarily through our direct sales force 
we have increased our combined us and european sales organization headcount from to during the year ended december  due to our relatively new sales staff  and because we have marketed our initial products such as stents and vena cava filters through third parties  we have limited experience marketing our products directly 
in order to market directly the cardioseal and starflex septal occluders and any related products  we will have to continue to develop a marketing and sales organization with technical expertise and distribution capabilities 
we may be unable to compete successfully because of intense competition and rapid technological change in our industry 
the medical device industry is characterized by rapidly evolving technology and intense competition 
existing and future products  therapies  technological approaches and delivery systems will continue to compete directly with our products 
many of our competitors have substantially greater capital resources  greater research and development  manufacturing and marketing resources and experience and greater name recognition than we do 
in addition  new surgical procedures and medications could be developed that replace or reduce the importance of current or future procedures that utilize our products 
as a result  any products that we develop may become obsolete before we recover any expenses incurred in connection with development of these products 
an adverse outcome in any litigation we are currently involved in could affect our financial condition we are currently involved in the litigation of disputes as described in item legal proceedings 
an adverse outcome in any one of these disputes could result in substantial monetary damages and  therefore  negatively impact our financial condition or results of operations 
product liability claims  product recalls and uninsured or underinsured liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the testing  marketing and sale of implantable devices and materials carry an inherent risk that users will assert product liability claims against us or our third party distributors 
in these lawsuits  users might allege that their use of our devices had adverse effects on their health 
a product liability claim or a product recall could have a material adverse effect on our business 
certain of our devices are designed to be used in life threatening situations where there is a high risk of serious injury or death 
although we currently maintain limited product liability insurance coverage  we cannot be certain that in the future we will be able to maintain such coverage on acceptable terms  or that current insurance or insurance subsequently obtained will provide adequate coverage against any or all potential claims 
furthermore  we cannot be certain that we will avoid significant product liability claims and the attendant adverse publicity 
any product liability claim  or other claim  with respect to uninsured or underinsured liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business 
intense industry competition for qualified employees could affect our ability to attract and retain necessary  qualified personnel 
in the medical device field  there is intense competition for qualified personnel and we cannot be assured that we will be able to continue to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business 
both the loss of the services of existing personnel  as well as the failure to recruit additional qualified scientific  technical and managerial personnel in a timely manner  would be detrimental to our anticipated growth and expansion into areas and activities requiring additional expertise  such as marketing 
the failure to attract and retain such personnel could adversely affect our business 
as a result of government regulations  we may experience lower sales and earnings 
the manufacture and sale of medical devices intended for commercial distribution are subject to extensive governmental regulations in the united states and abroad 
medical devices generally require pre market clearance or pre market approval prior to commercial distribution 
certain material changes or modifications to medical devices are also subject to regulatory review and clearance or approval 
the regulatory approval process is expensive  uncertain and lengthy 
if granted  the approval may include significant limitations on the indicated uses for which a product may be marketed 
in addition  any products that we manufacture or distribute are subject to continuing regulation by the fda 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or clearances for our products on a timely basis or at all 
the occurrence of any of the following events could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations delays in receipt of  or failure to receive  regulatory approvals or clearances  the loss of previously received approvals or clearances  limitations on the intended use of a device imposed as a condition of regulatory approvals or clearances  or our failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements 
in addition  sales of medical device products outside the united states are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country 
failure to comply with foreign regulatory requirements also could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we face uncertainties with respect to the availability of third party reimbursement 
in the united states  medicare  medicaid and other government insurance programs  as well as private insurance reimbursement programs  greatly affect revenues for suppliers of health care products and services 
such third party payors may affect the pricing or relative attractiveness of our products by regulating the maximum amount  if any  of reimbursement which they provide to the physicians and hospitals using our devices  or any other products that we may develop 
if  for any reason  the third party payors decided not to provide reimbursement for our products  this would materially adversely affect our ability to sell our products 
moreover  mounting concerns about rising health care costs may cause the government or private insurers to implement more restrictive coverage and reimbursement policies in the future 
in the international market  reimbursement by private third party medical insurance providers and by governmental insurers and providers varies from country to country 
in certain countries  our ability to achieve significant market penetration may depend upon the availability of third party governmental reimbursement 
the significant concentration of ownership of our common stock could limit investors ability to influence corporate actions 
a few of the company s stockholders  including jh whitney co 
and related entities  own a significant percentage of our outstanding common stock 
as a result  these stockholders may be able to influence the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions 
this concentration of ownership of our common stock may have the effect of impacting the probability and timing of a change in control of the company 
this could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of the company and might otherwise affect the market price of our common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december  and  the company did not participate in any derivative financial instruments or other financial and commodity instruments for which fair value disclosure would be required under sfas no 
 disclosures about fair value of financial instruments 
the company s investments are primarily short term money market accounts that are carried on the company s books at cost  which approximates fair market value  and us government agency debt instruments that are carried on the company s books at cost  increased or decreased by unrealized gains or losses  net of tax  respectively  which amounts are recorded as a component of stockholders equity in the company s consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  the company has no quantitative information concerning the market risk of participating in such investments 
the company is subject to market risk in the form of interest rate risk and foreign currency risk 
interest rate risk is immaterial to the company 
although the company has decreased its international operations following the sales of the uk operations of its former neurosciences business unit in april and the french operations of its neurosciences business unit in july  the company continues to denominate certain sales in non us currencies see note l of notes to consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  the company faces exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time and could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition 
the company translates the accounts of its foreign subsidiaries in accordance with sfas no 
 foreign currency translation 
prior to the sale of the company s neurosciences business unit  the assets and liabilities of these foreign subsidiaries were translated from their local currency into us dollars at the rate of exchange in effect at the end of each reporting period  while stockholders equity was translated at historical rates 
the company recorded the effects of changes in balance sheet items ie  cumulative foreign currency translation gains and losses as a component of consolidated stockholders equity 
the functional currency of the company s remaining foreign subsidiaries is the us dollar and  accordingly  translation gains and losses are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations 
revenue and expense accounts are translated using the weighted average exchange rate in effect during the period
