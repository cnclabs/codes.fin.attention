item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements documents we file with the securities and exchange commission sec may contain forward looking statements 
in addition  our senior management and other authorized spokespersons may make forward looking statements in print or orally to analysts  investors  the media and others 
forward looking statements concern  among others  plans  objectives  proposed capital expenditures and future events or performance 
such statements reflect our current expectations and involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
although we believe that our expectations are based on reasonable assumptions  actual results may differ materially from those suggested by the forward looking statements 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ include regulatory issues  including those that affect allowed rates of return  terms and condition of service  rate structures and financings 
in addition to the impact of our three state regulatory commissions  we purchase natural gas transportation and storage services from interstate and intrastate pipeline companies whose rates and services are regulated by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc and the north carolina utilities commission ncuc  respectively 
residential  commercial and industrial growth in our service territories 
the ability to grow our customer base and the pace of that growth are impacted by general business and economic conditions such as interest rates  inflation  fluctuations in the capital markets and the overall strength of the economy in our local markets and the country 
deregulation  unanticipated impacts of restructuring and competition in the energy industry 
we face competition from electric companies and energy marketing and trading companies 
as a result of deregulation  we expect this highly competitive environment to continue 
the potential loss of large volume industrial customers to alternate fuels or to bypass or the shift by such customers to special competitive contracts at lower per unit margins 
the ability to meet internal performance goals 
regulatory issues  customer growth  deregulation  economic and capital market conditions  the cost and availability of natural gas and weather conditions can impact our performance goals 
the capital intensive nature of our business  including governmental approvals  development project delays or changes in project costs 
weather  general economic conditions and the cost of funds to finance our capital projects can materially alter the cost of a project 
changes in the availability and cost of natural gas 
to meet customer requirements  we must acquire sufficient gas supplies and pipeline capacity to ensure delivery to our distribution system while also ensuring that our supply and capacity contracts will allow us to remain competitive 
natural gas is an unregulated commodity subject to market supply and demand and price volatility 
we have a diversified portfolio of local peaking facilities  transportation and storage contracts with interstate pipelines and supply contracts with major producers and marketers to satisfy the supply and delivery requirements of our customers 
because these producers  marketers and pipelines are subject to operating and financial risks associated with exploring  drilling  producing  gathering  marketing and transporting natural gas  their risks also increase our exposure to supply and price fluctuations 
we engage in hedging activity to minimize price volatility for our customers 
changes in weather conditions 
weather conditions and other natural phenomena can have a large impact on our earnings 
severe weather conditions can impact our suppliers and the pipelines that deliver gas to our distribution system 
extended mild or severe weather  either during the winter period or the summer period  can have a significant impact on the demand for and the cost of natural gas 
changes in environmental requirements and cost of compliance 
earnings from our equity investments 
we have investments in unregulated retail energy marketing services  interstate liquefied natural gas lng storage operations  intrastate and interstate pipeline operations and unregulated retail propane operations 
these companies have risks that are inherent to their industries and  as an equity investor  we assume such risks 
all of these factors are difficult to predict and many are beyond our control 
accordingly  while we believe these forward looking statements to be reasonable  there can be no assurance that they will approximate actual experience or that the expectations derived from them will be realized 
when used in our documents or oral presentations  the words anticipate  believe  intend  plan  estimate  expect  objective  projection  budget  forecast  goal or similar words or future or conditional verbs such as will  would  should  could or may are intended to identify forward looking statements 
factors relating to regulation and management are also described or incorporated in our annual report on form k  as well as information included in  or incorporated by reference from  future filings with the sec 
some of the factors that may cause actual results to differ have been described above 
others may be described elsewhere in the annual report to shareholders 
there also may be other factors besides those described above or incorporated in the form k that could cause actual conditions  events or results to differ from those in the forward looking statements 
forward looking statements reflect our current expectations only as of the date they are made 
we assume no duty to update these statements should expectations change or actual results differ from current expectations except as required by applicable laws and regulations

piedmontng 
com for current information 
our business piedmont natural gas company  inc  began operations in  and is an energy services company primarily engaged in the distribution of natural gas to  residential  commercial and industrial customers in north carolina  south carolina and tennessee 
piedmont is also invested in a number of non utility  energy related businesses  including companies involved in unregulated retail natural gas and propane marketing and interstate and intrastate natural gas storage and transportation 
we also sell residential and commercial gas appliances in tennessee 
our utility operations are subject to regulation by the ncuc  the public service commission of south carolina pscsc and the tennessee regulatory authority tra as to rates  service area  adequacy of service  safety standards  extensions and abandonment of facilities  accounting and depreciation 
we are also subject to regulation by the ncuc as to the issuance of securities 
we are also subject to or affected by various federal and state regulations 
we continually assess the nature of our business and explore alternatives to traditional utility regulation 
non traditional ratemaking initiatives and market based pricing of products and services provide additional challenges and opportunities for us 
in the carolinas  our service area is comprised of numerous cities  towns and communities including anderson  greenville  spartanburg and gaffney in south carolina and charlotte  salisbury  greensboro  winston salem  high point  burlington  hickory  spruce pine and reidsville in north carolina 
in tennessee  our service area is the metropolitan area of nashville 
we have two reportable business segments  domestic natural gas distribution and retail energy marketing services 
for further information on segments  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources we finance current cash requirements primarily from operating cash flows and short term borrowings 
outstanding short term borrowings under committed bank lines of credit totaling million ranged from zero to million during the year ended october   and interest rates ranged from to 
at october   million of short term debt was outstanding at a weighted average interest rate of 
borrowings under these lines include libor cost plus loans  transactional borrowings and overnight cost plus loans based on the lending bank s cost of money  with a maximum rate of the lending bank s commercial prime interest rate 
the maximum annual fee for the committed lines of credit is  we have additional uncommitted lines of credit totaling million on a no fee and as needed  if available  basis 
at october   our current assets were less than our current liabilities due primarily to the million long term debt maturity in  however  the lines of credit are adequate to provide the necessary near term liquidity 
our utility operations are weather sensitive 
the primary factor that impacts our cash flows from operations is weather 
warmer weather can lead to lower total margin from fewer volumes of natural gas sold or transported 
colder weather can increase volumes sold to weather sensitive customers  but extremely cold weather may lead to conservation by our customers in order to reduce their consumption 
weather outside the normal range of temperatures can lead to reduced operating cash flows  thereby increasing the need for short term borrowings to meet current cash requirements 
during  of our sales and transportation revenues were from residential customers and were from commercial customers  both of which are weather sensitive customer classes 
we have a weather normalization adjustment wna mechanism in all three states that partially offsets the impact of unusually cold or warm weather on bills rendered in november through march for these weather sensitive customers 
the mechanism is most effective in a reasonable temperature range relative to normal weather using years of history 
during  of our cash needs were funded through internal operations 
the level of short term borrowings can vary significantly due to changes in the wholesale prices of natural gas that are charged by suppliers and to increased gas supplies required to meet our customers needs during cold weather and to meet our storage needs 
short term debt generally increases when wholesale prices for natural gas increase because we must pay suppliers for the gas before we recover our costs from customers through their monthly bills 
we sell common stock and long term debt to cover cash requirements when market and other conditions favor such long term financing 
during  we issued million of equity through dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plans but none on the open market 
we did not sell any long term debt during the year 
we anticipate selling long term debt in the fourth quarter of under the million combined debt and equity shelf registration statement filed with the sec in unless otherwise specified at the time such securities are offered for sale  the net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes  including construction of additional facilities  repayment of short term debt and working capital needs 
pending such use  we may temporarily invest the net proceeds in investment grade securities 
our debt ratings are a from moody s and a from standard poor s s p 
we are well within the debt default provisions established for our senior notes  medium term notes  short term bank lines of credit and accounts receivable financings 
following the announcement of our proposed acquisition of north carolina natural gas  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  moody s and s p placed our debt ratings under review for possible downgrade 
the purchase price of million will initially be funded with short term debt that will be refinanced within six to nine months through the issuance of long term debt and equity securities 
while this acquisition will be positive in the long run by permitting us to expand our customer service base with an additional  customers in north carolina  it would have the initial effect of increased debt levels and reduced fixed charge coverages 
see further discussion of this acquisition in gas supply and regulatory proceedings 
at october   we had million of long term debt outstanding 
annual sinking fund requirements and maturities of this debt over the next five years are million in  million in  zero in  million in and zero in we retired million of long term debt in the financial condition of the pipelines and marketers that supply and deliver natural gas to our system can increase our exposure to supply and price fluctuations 
the williams companies  inc  whose subsidiary transcontinental gas pipe line corporation transco is the major pipeline which serves our carolina service areas and whose subsidiary williams energy services company wesco is a wholesale supplier of commodity natural gas service  has experienced financial difficulties 
wesco currently provides natural gas to us under several supply contracts 
in all cases with transco and wesco  and with other suppliers with whom we have smaller contracts  the products and services are received by us prior to payment or are subject to payment netting agreements 
we believe our risk exposure to the financial condition of these companies is minimal based on receipt of the products and other services prior to payment and the availability of other marketers of natural gas to meet our supply needs if necessary 
the natural gas business is seasonal in nature resulting in fluctuations primarily in balances in accounts receivable from customers  inventories of stored natural gas and accounts payable to suppliers in addition to short term borrowings discussed above 
our accounts receivable and accounts payable balances were higher at october   compared with  due in part to the purchase of the north carolina gas service gas distribution system from nui utilities  inc  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
from april to october  we build up natural gas inventories by injecting gas into storage for sale in the colder months 
most of our annual earnings are realized in the winter period  which is the first five months of our fiscal year 
we have a substantial capital expansion program for construction of distribution facilities  purchase of equipment and other general improvements funded through sources noted above 
the capital expansion program supports our approximately current annual growth in customer base 
utility construction expenditures for were million 
utility construction expenditures totaling million  primarily to serve customer growth  are budgeted for due to growth in our service area  significant utility construction expenditures are expected to continue 
short term debt may be used to finance construction pending the issuance of long term debt or equity 
during  cash provided from operations  from bank lines of credit and from the issuance of common stock through dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plans was sufficient to fund construction expenditures  pay debt principal and interest of million and pay dividends to shareholders of million 
our expected future contractual obligations at october   for long term debt  pipeline and storage capacity and gas supply and operating leases are as follows in millions payments due by period less than after contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt pipeline and storage capacity and gas supply operating leases at october   our capitalization consisted of in long term debt and in common equity 
our long term targeted capitalization ratio is in long term debt and in common equity 
the embedded cost of long term debt at october   was 
the return on average common equity for was 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods reported 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates and assumptions 
we base our estimates on historical experience  where applicable  and other relevant factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate estimates and assumptions and make adjustments in subsequent periods to reflect more current information if we determine that modifications in assumptions and estimates are warranted 
our domestic natural gas distribution segment is subject to regulation by certain state and federal authorities 
we have accounting policies that conform to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the effect of certain types of regulation statement  and are in accordance with accounting requirements and ratemaking practices prescribed by the regulatory authorities 
the application of these accounting policies allows us to defer expenses and income on the balance sheet as regulatory assets and liabilities when it is probable that those expenses and income will be allowed in the rate setting process in a period different from the period in which they would have been reflected in the income statement by an unregulated company 
we then recognize these deferred regulatory assets and liabilities through the income statement in the period in which the same amounts are reflected in rates 
at october   we had million of regulatory assets and million of regulatory liabilities  including deferred income tax liabilities of million 
if  for any reason  we cease to meet the criteria for application of regulatory accounting treatment for all or part of our operations  we would eliminate from the balance sheet the regulatory assets and liabilities related to these portions ceasing to meet such criteria and include them in the income statement for the period in which the discontinuance of regulatory accounting treatment occurs 
such an event could have a material effect on our results of operations in the period this action was recorded 
we believe the following represents the more significant judgments and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
for further discussion of significant accounting policies  see notes  and to the consolidated financial statements 
allowance for uncollectible accounts 
we evaluate the collectibility of our trade accounts receivable based on our recent loss history and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable amounts outstanding 
employee benefits 
we have a defined benefit pension plan for the benefit of eligible full time employees 
several statistical and other factors  which attempt to anticipate future events  are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plan 
these factors include assumptions about the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases  within certain guidelines 
in addition  our actuarial consultants also use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate the projected benefit obligation 
the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences may result in a significant impact on the amount of pension expense recorded in future periods 
self insurance 
we are self insured for certain losses related to general liability  group medical benefits and workers compensation 
we maintain stop loss coverage with third party insurers to limit our total exposure 
our liabilities represent estimates of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date 
the estimated liabilities are not discounted and are established based upon analyses of historical data and actuarial estimates 
we  along with independent actuaries  review the liabilities at least annually to ensure that they are appropriate 
while we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information available  our financial results could be impacted if actual trends  including the severity or frequency of claims or fluctuations in premiums  differ from our estimates 
long term incentive plan 
we have a long term incentive plan ltip covering five year performance periods under which units are awarded to participants 
each unit is equivalent in value to one share of common stock 
following the end of the performance period  awards are distributed in the form of shares of common stock and cash withheld to pay taxes if performance measures are met 
during the performance period  we calculate the expense and liability for the ltip based on performance levels achieved or expected to be achieved and the estimated market value of common stock as of the distribution date 
while we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information available  actual amounts  which are not known until after the end of the performance period  could differ from our estimates 
gas supply and regulatory proceedings to meet customer requirements  we acquire sufficient gas supplies and pipeline capacity to ensure delivery to meet the demands of our distribution system while also ensuring that supply and capacity contracts allow us to remain competitive 
we have a diversified portfolio of local peaking facilities  transportation and storage contracts with interstate pipelines and supply contracts with major producers and marketers to satisfy the supply and delivery requirements of our customers 
in our opinion  present rules and regulations of our three state regulatory commissions permit the pass through of interstate pipeline capacity and storage service costs that may be incurred under orders or regulations of the ferc  as well as commodity gas costs from natural gas suppliers 
the majority of our natural gas supply is purchased from producers and marketers in non regulated transactions 
our rate schedules include provisions permitting the recovery of prudently incurred gas costs 
the ncuc and the pscsc require annual prudence reviews covering a historical twelve month period 
for the most recent period  the ncuc and the pscsc found us to be prudent in our gas purchasing practices and allowed recovery of our gas costs 
in  the ncuc ordered us to establish an expansion fund to enable the extension of natural gas service into unserved areas of the state 
the expansion fund was funded with supplier refunds  plus investment income earned  that would otherwise be refunded to customers 
during and  the ncuc allowed us to use million of expansion funds to extend natural gas service to the counties of avery  mitchell and yancey 
as we believe that we have no other anticipated projects that qualify for expansion funds as currently determined by the ncuc  we petitioned the ncuc on january   for permission to deposit supplier refunds held in escrow at that time and future supplier refunds in the appropriate gas costs deferred accounts for refund to customers 
on february  the ncuc agreed and ordered that these supplier refunds be placed in the deferred accounts 
at october   the balance in our expansion fund was million and is included in restricted cash and refunds due customers in the consolidated balance sheets 
effective january   we purchased for cash the natural gas distribution assets of atmos energy corporation located in the city of gaffney and portions of cherokee county  south carolina 
the acquisition was at net book value of million and added  customers to our operations 
in september  we filed a petition with the pscsc seeking approval of a gas cost hedging plan for the purpose of cost stabilization for customers 
on march   the pscsc issued an order approving the plan on an experimental basis 
the pscsc ruled that all properly accounted for costs incurred in accordance with the plan  with the exception of certain personnel and administrative costs  would be deemed prudently incurred and would be recoverable in rates as a gas cost 
we began hedging activities in april under the approved program 
in october  we filed an application with the ncuc seeking approval to implement an experimental natural gas hedging program 
at the time  the ncuc was engaged in a generic investigation into the hedging of natural gas commodity costs  and the ncuc took no action on our application pending further proceedings in the generic investigation 
on february   the ncuc issued an order in the generic proceeding that concluded  among other things  that hedging costs should be treated as gas costs and that pre approval of a hedging program would be inconsistent with the procedures for the annual gas costs prudency reviews 
in its order  the ncuc stated that hedging is an option that must be considered in connection with the gas purchasing practices of a local distribution company 
the ncuc recognized that the review of the prudency of a decision to hedge or not to hedge  just like the review of the prudency of other gas purchasing decisions  must be made on the basis of the information available at the time the decision is made  not on the basis of the information available at the time of the annual prudency review proceeding 
on april  we again asked the ncuc for approval to operate a hedging plan on an experimental basis for a period of two years and for reconsideration of the ncuc s conclusion on the pre approval of a hedging program 
on october  the ncuc denied our request for pre approval  however  the ncuc commended us for our hedging plan proposal and our contribution to the understanding of hedging by the ncuc 
the ncuc made it clear that while it would not pre approve the plan  it recognized that the plan is experimental in nature and did not wish to be understood as having disapproved the plan or expressed the opinion that adoption of the plan would result in disallowances in an annual review of gas costs 
nothing in the order precluded us from implementing the plan if we chose to do so subject to the terms of the order in the generic proceeding 
given the favorable comments and assurances by the ncuc in both orders  we implemented a hedging program in north carolina effective november  on march   we filed an application with the ncuc requesting an annual increase in revenues of million  an increase of 
in addition  we requested changes in cost allocations and rate design and changes in tariffs and service regulations 
on august  a stipulation among piedmont  the public staff of the ncuc and carolina utility customers association  inc  an intervenor  was filed with the ncuc 
the stipulation resolved all outstanding issues among the stipulating parties and provided for an annual increase in revenues of million 
a hearing was held on august at the hearing and based on further residential rate design changes agreed to by us  the only intervenor who did not sign the stipulation did not oppose the stipulation 
on october  the ncuc issued an order approving an annual revenue increase of million  effective november  on may   we filed an application with the pscsc requesting an annual increase in revenues of million  an increase of 
in addition  we requested approval of new depreciation rates  changes in cost allocations and rate design and changes in tariffs and service regulations 
a hearing was held on september and on october  the pscsc issued an order approving an annual revenue increase of million  effective november  the consumer advocate of south carolina has requested a rehearing of the order and we are unable to predict the outcome of that request 
effective september   we purchased substantially all of the natural gas distribution assets and certain of the liabilities  including potential remediation costs of a manufactured gas plant site  of north carolina gas service ncgs  a division of nui utilities  inc  for million in cash 
the transaction added  customers to our distribution system in the counties of rockingham and stokes  north carolina 
included in the assets acquired was ncgs s expansion fund in the amount of million 
at october   this amount is included in restricted cash and refunds due customers in the consolidated balance sheets 
on october   we entered into an agreement to purchase for million in cash the stock of north carolina natural gas ncng  a natural gas distribution subsidiary of progress energy  inc  serving  customers in eastern north carolina  and progress energy s investment in eastern north carolina natural gas company easternnc 
easternnc is a joint venture with albemarle pamlico economic development corporation to bring natural gas service to counties in eastern north carolina 
the transaction is subject to approvals by various regulatory agencies and is expected to close in mid in  the tra approved a performance incentive plan  effective july   that eliminated annual prudence reviews in tennessee and established an incentive sharing mechanism based on differences in the actual cost of gas purchased and benchmark amounts determined by published market indices  together with margin from marketing transportation and capacity in the secondary market and from secondary market sales of gas 
the plan is subject to an overall annual cap of million on gains or losses by us 
the benefits of the incentive plan are the elimination of annual gas purchase prudence reviews  reduction of gas costs for customers and potential earnings to shareholders by sharing in gas cost reductions 
initially approved for a two year period  the plan now continues each july until we notify the tra of termination days before the end of a plan year or until the plan is modified  amended or terminated by the tra 
secondary market transactions permit us to market gas supplies and transportation services by contract with wholesale or off system customers 
these sales contribute smaller per unit wholesale margins to earnings  however  the program allows us to act as a wholesale marketer of natural gas and transportation capacity in order to generate operating margin from sources not restricted by the capacity of our retail distribution system 
in north carolina  a sharing mechanism is in effect where of any margin earned is refunded to customers 
in connection with the south carolina rate case discussed above  this same sharing mechanism is in place in south carolina effective november  secondary market transactions in tennessee are included in the performance incentive plan discussed above 
in  of gas deliveries were made to industrial or large commercial customers which have the capability to burn a fuel other than natural gas 
the alternative fuels are primarily fuel oil and propane and  to a much lesser extent  coal or wood 
the ability to maintain or increase deliveries of gas to these customers depends on a number of factors  including weather conditions  governmental regulations  the price of gas from suppliers and the price of alternate fuels 
under existing regulations of the ferc  certain large volume customers located in proximity to the interstate pipelines delivering gas to us could attempt to bypass us and take delivery of gas directly from the pipeline or from a third party connecting with the pipeline 
to date  only minimal bypass activity has been experienced  in part because of our ability to negotiate competitive rates and service terms 
the future level of bypass activity cannot be predicted 
in  we requested special accounting treatment from the ncuc  the pscsc and the tra to allow us to defer for recovery in future rates the amounts of accounts receivable that were written off during in excess of amounts recovered through base rates 
these higher write offs resulted from the high gas prices and abnormally cold weather experienced during the winter season 
the pscsc and the tra approved deferral of only the gas cost portion of the excess write offs  which totaled million  for recovery under normal purchased gas cost adjustment pga procedures 
the ncuc did not approve our request

heritage propane competes with electricity  natural gas and fuel oil  as well as with other companies in the retail propane distribution business 
the propane business  like natural gas  is seasonal  with weather conditions significantly affecting the demand for propane 
heritage propane purchases propane at numerous supply points for delivery primarily via railroad tank cars and common carrier transport 
heritage propane s profitability is also sensitive to changes in the wholesale prices of propane

piedmont energy company  a wholly owned subsidiary of pep  has a interest in southstar energy services llc southstar  a delaware limited liability company 
the other members are subsidiaries of agl resources  inc  and dynegy inc 
southstar sells natural gas to residential  commercial and industrial customers in the southeastern united states 
southstar was formed and began marketing natural gas in georgia in when that state implemented full natural gas retail competition 
southstar conducts most of its business in georgia  and the unregulated retail gas market in that state is highly competitive 
the operating policy of southstar contains a provision for the disproportionate sharing of earnings in excess of a threshold per annum  cumulative pre tax return of 
this threshold is not reached until all prior period losses are recovered 
earnings below the return threshold are allocated to members based on their ownership percentages 
earnings above the threshold are allocated at various percentages based on actual margin generated in four defined service areas 
the earnings test is based on southstar s fiscal year ending december  therefore  the actual impact  if any  of disproportionate sharing is not known until after december at october   we estimated that a portion of southstar s earnings for calendar year will be above the threshold  and that disproportionate sharing will occur for the first time 
we reduced our portion of the equity earnings from southstar for the twelve months ended october   by  pre tax  to reflect our estimate that our earnings from southstar will be at a level of approximately of total earnings  rather than our equity ownership percentage of of total earnings 
based on various calculation methodologies and interpretations of the operating policy  our pre tax earnings reduction for due to disproportionate sharing could range from zero to million 
southstar manages commodity price and weather risks through hedging activities using derivative financial instruments  physical commodity contracts and option based weather derivative contracts 
financial contracts in the form of futures  options and swaps are used to hedge the price volatility of natural gas 
these derivative transactions qualify as cash flow hedges 
movements in the mark to market value of these agreements are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheets as a hedge under statement weather derivative contracts are used to preserve margins in the event of warmer than normal weather during the winter period

environmental matters our three state regulatory commissions have authorized us to utilize deferral accounting  or to create a regulatory asset  in connection with environmental costs 
accordingly  we have established regulatory assets for environmental costs incurred and for estimated environmental liabilities 
in  we entered into a settlement with a third party with respect to nine manufactured gas plant mgp sites that we have owned  leased or operated and paid an amount that released us from any investigation and remediation liability 
three other mgp sites that we also have owned  leased or operated were not included in the settlement 
in september  in connection with the purchase of the operations of ncgs discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we acquired the liability for an mgp site located in reidsville  north carolina 
we had a limited assessment performed by a third party that consisted of an evaluation of documents  a site visit and an interview with an employee of the seller 
this study concluded that a comprehensive baseline risk assessment would cost  and the maximum cost to remediate the site would be  based on this study and the similar nature of the three sites not covered by the settlement  we increased our environmental liability in the fourth quarter of by million  with an offsetting increase to a regulatory asset  to reflect a liability of  for each of the four sites 
at october   our undiscounted environmental liability totaled million  consisting of million for the four mgp sites and  for underground storage tanks not yet remediated 
this liability is not net of any anticipated recoveries 
at october   our regulatory assets for environmental costs totaled million  net of recoveries from customers  in connection with the estimated liabilities for the mgp sites and underground storage tanks and for environmental costs incurred  primarily legal fees and engineering assessments 
the portion of the regulatory assets representing actual costs incurred is being amortized as recovered in current approved rates from customers in all three states 
further evaluations of the mgp sites and the underground storage tank sites could significantly affect recorded amounts  however  we believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on financial position or results of operations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk all financial instruments discussed below are held by us for purposes other than trading 
we are potentially exposed to market risk due to changes in interest rates and the cost of gas 
exposure to interest rate changes relates to both short and long term debt 
exposure to gas cost variations relates to the supply of and demand for natural gas 
interest rate risk we have short term bank lines of credit available to provide working capital and general corporate funds 
the level of borrowings under the lines varies from period to period  depending upon many factors  including our investments in capital projects 
future short term interest expense and payments will be impacted by both short term interest rates and borrowing levels 
at october   we had million of short term debt outstanding at a weighted average interest rate of 
the carrying amount of our short term debt approximates fair value 
information about our long term debt at october   that is sensitive to changes in interest rates is presented below 
expected maturity date fair value there at october after total  dollars in millions fixed rate long term debt average interest rate commodity price risk in the normal course of business  we utilize contracts of various duration for the forward sales and purchase of natural gas 
we manage our gas supply costs through a portfolio of short and long term procurement contracts with various suppliers 
due to cost based rate regulation  we have limited exposure to changes in commodity prices as substantially all changes in purchased gas costs from suppliers are passed on to customers through purchased gas adjustment procedures
