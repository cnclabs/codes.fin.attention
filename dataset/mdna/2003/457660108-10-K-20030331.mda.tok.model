the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in item of this form k 
overview we are an ophthalmic product development company focused on developing genetically based technology for the diagnosis  prognosis and management of glaucoma  as well as ophthalmic pharmaceutical products based on our proprietary durasite eyedrop based drug delivery technology 
in addition  we have a retinal program that includes both a therapeutic agent and a retinal drug delivery technology 
we are focusing our commercial efforts and research and development on the following targeted market introduction of our ocugene glaucoma genetic test based on our isv technology  expanding our isv technology for the diagnosis  prognosis and management of glaucoma  isv  a durasite formulation for the treatment of glaucoma  isv  a durasite formulation of azithromycin  an antibiotic not currently used in ophthalmology  isv  a durasite formulation of a fourth generation fluoroquinolone  isv  a retinal drug delivery device  and treatments for diabetic retinopathy and macular degeneration 

table of contents since our inception through the end of  we had not received any revenues from the sale of our products  although we have received a small amount of royalties from the sale of our aquasite product by ciba vision and global damon 
in the fourth quarter of  we commercially launched our ocugene glaucoma genetic test and in the beginning of we began to receive a small amount of revenues from the sale of this test 
with the exception of  we have been unprofitable on an annual basis since our inception due to continuing research and development efforts  including preclinical studies  clinical trials and manufacturing of our product candidates 
we have financed our research and development activities and operations primarily through private and public placement of our equity securities and  to a lesser extent  from collaborative agreements 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the us requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the following are items in our financial statements that require significant estimates and judgments inventory 
our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
the cost of the inventory is based on the first in first out method 
if the cost of the inventory exceeds the expected market value a provision is recorded for the difference between cost and market 
at december   our inventories solely consisted of ocugene kits 
property and equipment 
property and equipment is stated at cost  less accumulated depreciation 
depreciation of property and equipment is provided over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets  which range from three to five years  using the straight line method 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the lives of the related leases or their estimated useful lives  whichever is shorter  using the straight line method 
it is our policy to write off our fully depreciated assets 
additionally  we record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amounts of those assets 
revenue recognition 
we recognize up front fees over the expected term of the related research and development services using the straight line method 
when changes in the expected term of ongoing services are identified  the amortization period for the remaining fees is appropriately modified 
revenue related to performance milestones is recognized when the milestone is achieved based on the terms set forth in the related agreements 
we directly reduce expenses for amounts reimbursed due to cost sharing agreements 
we recognize the received cost sharing payments when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we receive royalties from licensees based on third party sales and the royalties are recorded as earned in accordance with contract terms  when third party results are reliably measured and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue related to the sales of our product  the ocugene glaucoma genetic test  is recognized when all related services have been rendered and collectibility is reasonably assured 

table of contents cost of goods 
we recognize the cost of inventory shipped and other costs related to our ocugene glaucoma genetic test when they are incurred 
research and development r d expenses 
r d expenses include salaries  benefits  facility costs  services provided by outside consultants and contractors  administrative costs and materials for our research and development activities 
we also fund research at a variety of academic institutions based on agreements that are generally cancelable 
we recognize such costs as they are incurred 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses 
sg a expenses include salaries  benefits  facility costs  services provided by outside consultants and contractors  advertising and marketing  investor relations  financial reporting  materials and other expenses related to general corporate and sales and marketing activities 
results of operations we had total net revenues of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our net revenues in represented sales of ocugene as well as royalties 
in  our net revenues only represented royalties while the net revenues in included licensing revenue 
the net revenues in included the impact of the implementation of staff accounting bulletin sab 
sab included new guidelines from the securities and exchange commission regarding revenue recognition of non refundable up front license fees  such as the  net licensing fee we received from pharmacia in to implement sab  the net licensing fee from pharmacia  previously recognized as revenue in  was deferred in our cumulative effect of accounting change and was amortized over the term of the ongoing research and development activities 
as a result  we recorded a charge for the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle of  as of january  upon the termination of the related licensing agreement in december  the remaining unamortized deferred revenue was recognized 
amortization of revenue deferred in the cumulative effect was  of the total net revenues for we earned royalty income of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  from sales of aquasite by ciba vision  and global damon which began selling aquasite in korea in we have not relied on royalty revenues to fund our activities  and beginning in the year ended december  we received only minimal revenues from the sale of products 
our r d expenses in decreased to million from million in r d expenses in increased to million from million in in funding for external research and consultants for our isv and isv programs decreased by approximately million as we focused our resources on the targeted launch of ocugene and on the antibiotic programs isv and isv expenditures on our antibiotic programs in increased million mainly due to preparations for the filing of an ind for isv the increase in related primarily to the cost of preparing for  and filing  an ind and the subsequent initiation of clinical studies for the isv antibiotic program 
additionally  the cost of filing and maintaining our owned and licensed patents increased as our patent portfolio grew 
in  our r d cost reimbursements decreased to million from million in this decrease reflected the termination of the isv license by pharmacia in cost reimbursement in related to joint development programs to evaluate compounds for ophthalmic use 
in  cost reimbursement decreased to million from million in this decrease reflected the termination of both the isv and the isv licenses by pharmacia in and our r d activities can be separated into two major segments  research and clinical development 
research includes activities involved in evaluating a potential product and the related pre clinical testing 
clinical development includes activities related to filings with the fda and the related human clinical testing required to 
table of contents obtain marketing approval for a potential product 
we estimate that the following represents the approximate cost of these activities for  and in thousands research clinical development total research and development due to our limited personnel and the number of projects that we are developing  our personnel are involved in a number of projects at the same time 
accordingly  the majority of our r d expenses are not linked to a specific project but are allocated across projects  based on personnel time expended on each project 
accordingly  the allocated costs may not reflect the actual costs of each project 
the decrease in research activities in compared to mainly represents the conversion of a portion of the isv research into the ocugene glaucoma genetic test  which is in the initial marketing launch phase 
research is being conducted on other genes and genetic markers but at a lower rate as our limited resources are used to support the commercialized technology 
as much of this research is conducted at external academic centers  we were able to scale back this research without incurring termination costs 
the increase in our research activities in compared to reflects the addition of antibiotic programs to our portfolio and the expansion of our glaucoma genetics research projects to include several new genes and genetic markers 
expenses for such activities are expensed when incurred as these research agreements may be terminated when the appropriate notice is provided as required in each agreement 
clinical development expenses remained consistent between and  as the clinical trial activity was comparable between the two years 
we shifted the resources used to file the ind for isv in to similar activities on the isv program in the increase in our clinical development expenses in from reflects the initiation of clinical studies on our isv antibiotic project  the conduct of clinical studies to support our glaucoma genetics projects and the increased number of projects we had filed with the fda as of such periods 
most of our projects are in the early stages of the product development cycle and may not result in commercial products 
projects in development may not proceed into clinical trials due to a number of reasons even though the project looks promising early in the process 
once a project reaches clinical trials it may be found to be ineffective or there may be harmful side effects 
additionally  during the development cycle  other companies may develop new treatments that decrease the market potential for our project and we may decide not to proceed 
other factors including the cost of manufacturing at a commercial scale and the availability of quality manufacturing capabilities could negatively impact our ability to bring the project to the market 
also  our business strategy is to license projects to third parties to complete the development cycle and to market and sell the product 
if we are unable to enter into collaborative arrangements for any product candidate  our ability to commercialize the product may be slowed or we may decide not to proceed with that candidate 
these collaborative arrangements may either speed the development or they may extend the anticipated time to market 
because of these factors  as well as others  we cannot be certain if  or when  our projects in development will complete the development cycle and be commercialized 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased in to million from million in  and increased in to million from million in the increase in reflects the additional costs incurred to support the ongoing launch of the ocugene glaucoma genetic test 
these costs include the addition of a vp of commercial development  expanded promotional advertising and outreach activities into ophthalmic and optometric practices 
the increase in is primarily related to million we expended on preparing for  and executing  the commercial launch of the ocugene glaucoma genetic test 

table of contents net interest and other income was   and  in   and  respectively 
these fluctuations are due principally to changes in average cash balances and decreased interest rates 
interest earned in the future will be dependent on our funding cycles and prevailing interest rates 
we had a net loss for the years ended december   and of million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in the net loss in mainly reflects the costs incurred to support the ongoing launch of the ocugene glaucoma genetic test 
the increase in the net loss in mainly reflects the decrease in cost reimbursement from pharmacia  the higher cost of our development projects and costs incurred in the launch of the ocugene glaucoma genetic test 
liquidity and capital resources through  we financed our operations primarily through private placements of preferred stock totaling approximately million and an october initial public offering of common stock  which resulted in net proceeds of approximately million 
after  we financed our operations through a january private placement of common stock and warrants resulting in net proceeds of approximately million and an april public offering which raised net proceeds of approximately million 
in accordance with a july agreement with b l  we received a total of million from the sale of common stock in august and in september  we completed a million private placement of  shares of redeemable convertible series a preferred stock resulting in net proceeds of approximately million 
in january  we entered into a transaction with pharmacia from which we received a total of million from the sale of common stock in january and september 
in november  we entered into another transaction with pharmacia from which we received a million licensing fee and  in january  received million from the sale of common stock 
in april  we received million from the exercise of warrants issued as part of the private placement 
in may  we completed a private placement of common stock and warrants from which we raised net proceeds of approximately million

in february  we received million from the issuance of additional shares of series a preferred stock to bausch lomb as we reached the first milestone under the isv license agreement 
during   and we also received  and  and  respectively  from the issuance of common stock related to the exercise of stock options and sales of common stock through our employee stock purchase plan 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents totaling million 
it is our policy to invest these funds in highly liquid securities  such as interest bearing money market funds  treasury and federal agency notes and corporate debt 
our auditors have included an explanatory paragraph in their audit report referring to our recurring operating losses and a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
absent additional funding from private or public equity or debt financings  collaborative or other partnering arrangements  or other sources  we currently anticipate that cash on hand and anticipated cash flow from operations may only be adequate to fund our operations in the ordinary course until approximately the middle of the second fiscal quarter of our financial statements were prepared on the assumption that we will continue as a going concern 
the report of our auditors acknowledges that we have incurred recurring operating losses  have an accumulated deficit of million and do not currently have available sufficient funds to sustain operations through fiscal year these conditions cause substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern 
our financial statements included herein do not include any adjustments that might result should we be unable to continue as a going concern 
our management is implementing plans designed to reduce our cash requirements through reductions in operating expenditures  which may include reductions in our workforce 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement these plans or that we will be able to do so without significantly harming our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we are seeking additional funding through public or private equity or debt financings  collaborative or other partnering arrangements  and from other sources 
the factors leading to and the existence of the explanatory paragraph in the audit report may harm our ability to obtain additional funding and could make the terms of any such funding  if available  less favorable than might otherwise be the case 
however  there can be no assurance that we will obtain such funding or that such funding  if obtained  will be sufficient to continue our operations as currently conducted 
in addition  our 
table of contents stockholders may suffer substantial dilution if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities 
if we cannot raise additional funding  we may be required to delay  scale back or eliminate one or more of our research  discovery  development or marketing programs  or scale back or cease operations altogether 
for the years ended december    and  cash used for operating activities and to acquire capital equipment  was million  million and million  respectively 
of those amounts    and  were for additions to laboratory and other property and equipment in   and  respectively 
our future capital expenditures and requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the progress of our research and development programs and preclinical and clinical testing  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  our ability to establish additional collaborative arrangements  changes in our existing collaborative and licensing relationships  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  acquisition of new businesses  products and technologies  the completion of commercialization activities and arrangements  the timing of additional product development and the purchase of additional property and equipment 
starting in  we wrote off our fully depreciated assets 
this resulted in a decrease in both property and equipment and accumulated depreciation of   and  in  and  respectively  with no change in net property and equipment 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million 
there can be no assurance that we will ever achieve or be able to maintain either significant revenues from product sales or royalties or profitable operations 
we do not anticipate any material capital expenditures to be incurred for environmental compliance in fiscal year based on our good environmental compliance record to date  and our current compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations  environmental compliance is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our operations 
our commitments as of december  were as follows in thousands total due in due in due in due in capital lease obligations operating leases research and development agreements licensing agreements total commitments we lease certain laboratory equipment under capital lease agreements  which expire through we lease our facilities under a non cancelable operating lease that expires in we have research and development agreements with academic centers in the us and europe 
the terms of most of these agreements are one year with the option to extend the term with the consent of both the academic center and us 
we have entered into certain license agreements that require us to make minimum royalty payments for the life of the licensed patents 
the life of the patents which may be issued and covered by the license agreements cannot be determined at this time  but the minimum royalties due under such agreements are as noted for through and are approximately  per year after until the expiration of the related patents
