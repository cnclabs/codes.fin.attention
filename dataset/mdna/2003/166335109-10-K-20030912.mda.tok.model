item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company s results of operations depend primarily on its net interest income  which is the difference between interest income on interest earning assets  which consists principally of loans and investment securities  and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  which consist of deposits and borrowings 
net interest income is determined by the company s interest rate spread the difference between the yields earned on its interest earning assets and the rates paid on its interest bearing liabilities and the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the company s results of operations also are affected by the provision for loan losses resulting from management s assessment of the allowance for loan losses  the level of its non interest income  including investment service fees  account service fees and related income and gains and losses from the sales of loans and securities  the level of its non interest expense  including salaries and employee benefits  occupancy and equipment expense  data processing services  deposit insurance premiums  advertising  other operating costs  and income tax expense 
the bank is a community oriented bank  which emphasizes customer service and convenience 
as part of this strategy  the bank offers products and services designed to meet the needs of its customers 
the company generally has sought to achieve long term financial growth and strength by increasing the amount and stability of its net interest income and non interest income and by maintaining a high level of asset quality 
in pursuit of these goals  the company has adopted a business strategy emphasizing growth in basic financial services 
the focus is on commercial and construction lending  commercial deposits and treasury management  consumer deposits and loans and trust and investment management 
critical accounting policies and estimates discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on the consolidated financial statements of the company  which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the bank to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company evaluates estimates on an on going basis  including those related to the allowance for loan losses  non accrual loans  other real estate owned  other than temporary impairments of investment securities  pension and post retirement benefits  the stock option plan  recourse liabilities and income taxes 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and various other factors and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of its consolidated financial statements allowance for loan losses  income taxes  and other than temporary impairment of investment securities 
each estimate is discussed below 
the financial impact of each estimate is discussed in the applicable subsections of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and operations 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level that represents management s best estimate of known and inherent losses  which are probable and reasonably estimable based upon an evaluation of the loan portfolio as of the date of the balance sheet 
homogeneous portfolios of loans  which include residential mortgage  home equity and other consumer loans  are evaluated as a group 
commercial business loans greater than  commercial mortgage and construction loans are evaluated individually 
specific portions of the allowance are developed by analyzing individual loans for adequacy of collateral  cash flow and other risks unique to that particular loan 
general portions of the allowance are developed by grading individual loans in the commercial and construction portfolios and applying loss factors by grade 
the general portion of the allowance also includes loss factors applied to the homogeneous portfolios as a group 
the loss factors applied to graded loans were developed based on the company s loss history for loans with similar attributes as well as input from the company s primary banking regulators 
loss factors are applied to homogeneous loans based upon prior loss experience of the portfolio as well as delinquency trends  the volume of non performing loans  the volume of classified and watch list loans and trends in concentration of loans to single borrowers 
although management believes it has used the best information available to it in making such determinations  and that the present allowance for loan losses is adequate  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary  and net income may be adversely affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in determining the level of the allowance 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the bank s allowance for losses on loans 
such agencies may require the bank to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination 
the allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses  which is charged to operations 
loan losses  other than those incurred on loans held for sale  are charged directly against the allowance and recoveries on previously charged off loans are added to the allowance 
for purposes of applying the measurement criteria for impaired loans  the company excludes large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans  primarily consisting of residential real estate loans and consumer loans as well as commercial business loans with balances of less than  for applicable loans  the company evaluates the need for impairment recognition when a loan becomes non accrual or earlier if  based on management s assessment of the relevant facts and circumstances  it is probable that the company will be unable to collect all proceeds under the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
at june   the recorded investment in impaired loans was million as compared to thousand at june  the increase is due primarily to the aforementioned single commercial real estate loan 
the company s policy for the recognition of interest income on impaired loans is the same as for non accrual loans 
a portion of an impaired loan is charged off when the company determines that foreclosure is probable and the fair value less estimated disposition costs of the collateral is less than the recorded investment of the impaired loan 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax base  as well as tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
a valuation allowance is established against deferred tax assets when in the judgment of management  it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will not become available 
based on management s evaluation of the likelihood of realization  no valuation allowance has been established 
because the judgment about the level of future taxable income is dependent to a great extent on matters that may  at least in part  be beyond the company s control  it is at least reasonably possible that management s judgment about the need for a valuation allowance for deferred taxes could change in the near term 
other than temporary impairment of investment securities securities are evaluated periodically to determine whether a decline in their value is other than temporary 
management utilizes criteria such as the magnitude and duration of the decline  in addition to the reasons underlying the decline  to determine whether the loss in value is other than temporary 
the term other than temporary is not intended to indicate that the decline is permanent  but indicates that the prospects for a near term recovery of value is not necessarily favorable  or that there is a lack of evidence to support realizable value equal to or greater than carrying value of the investment 
once a decline in value is determined to be other than temporary  the value of the security is reduced and a corresponding charge to earnings is recognized 
business strategy growth 
the company seeks to increase its assets through internal growth and by expanding its operations 
in  the company s assets increased by million  or from million at june  to million at june  resulting mainly from the million growth in the loan portfolio 
such loan growth was funded primarily with a growth in core deposits 
emphasis on commercial lending 
the company has been and will continue to expand its higher yielding portfolios of commercial real estate and commercial business loans 
this strategy is reflected in the shifting composition of the company s loan portfolio 
the company s commercial real estate  commercial business and construction and land acquisition loans comprised of its total loan portfolio at june  compared to at june  single family and multi family residential loans comprised of the company s loan portfolio at june  as compared to at june  maintain loan quality 
management believes that maintaining high loan quality is key to achieving and sustaining long term financial success 
accordingly  the company has sought to maintain a high level of asset quality and moderate credit risk by using underwriting standards which management believes are conservative and by generally limiting its origination of loans to its market area 
the company s non accrual loans increased by million to million at june   with the increase largely attributed to a single commercial real estate loan in the amount of million 
although the loan is current in the payment of interest as it has been due and the next quarterly payment is backed by a letter of credit from an independent bank  the loan was placed on non accrual as principal was not repaid in accordance with the original stated maturity  the borrower has encountered financial difficulties  the underlying real estate is outside the bank s primary lending area and repayment is dependent upon factors not under the completed control of the borrower 
excluding this loan  the company s ratio of non performing assets to total assets at june  was and its allowance for loan losses to non performing loans was  while at june  the percentages were and  respectively 
stable source of liquidity 
the company purchases investment securities that management believes to be appropriate for liquidity  yield and credit quality in order to achieve a managed and more predictable source of liquidity to meet loan demand and  to a lesser extent  a stable source of interest income 
the portfolio totaled  in the aggregate  million at june  compared to million at june  emphasis on deposits and customer service 
the company  as a community based financial institution  is largely dependent upon its base of competitively priced core deposits to provide a stable source of funding 
the company has retained many loyal customers over the years through a combination of high quality service  competitively priced service fees  customer convenience  an experienced staff and a strong commitment to the communities in which it serves 
lower costing deposits  which exclude time deposits  totaled million or of the company s total deposits at june   as compared to million at june   a million or increase 
this increase in lower costing deposits is primarily attributable to the continuing effort to grow core deposits 
pursuant to the company s strategy  the major focus in will continue to be on increasing commercial and consumer core deposits and relying less on certificates of deposits  both consumer and municipal 
in addition  the company has not used brokered deposits as a source of funds and presently has no plans to do so in the future 
contractual obligations  commitments  contingent liabilities and off balance sheet items the following table presents  at june   the company s significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations by payment date 
such amounts do not include any unamortized premium  discounts or other similar carrying value adjustments

derivative contracts are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet 
see notes to consolidated financial statements 
a schedule of significant commitments at june  follows contract or amount at june  commitments to originate loans  undisbursed loans in process construction  undisbursed lines of credit  commercial letters of credit  total  asset liability management the primary asset liability management goal of the company is to manage and control the interest rate risk of the bank subsidiary  thereby reducing its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates  and achieving sustainable growth in net interest income over the long term 
other objectives of asset liability management include ensuring adequate liquidity and funding  maintaining a strong capital base and maximizing net interest income opportunities 
in general  interest rate risk is mitigated by closely matching the maturities or re pricing periods of interest sensitive assets and liabilities to ensure a favorable interest rate spread 
management regularly reviews the bank s interest rate sensitivity  and uses a variety of strategies as needed to adjust that sensitivity within acceptable tolerance ranges established by the board of directors 
changing the relative proportions of fixed rate and adjustable rate assets and liabilities is one of the primary strategies utilized by the company to accomplish this objective 
additionally  the company may from time to time utilize off balance sheet instruments such as interest rate swaps  interest rate collars  interest rate floors  interest rate swaptions or combinations thereof to assist in its asset liability management 
at june   the company was positively gapped whereby its interest earning assets were re pricing at a quicker rate than its interest bearing liabilities 
to partially offset the negative impact of the current low market interest rate environment  the company entered into a million notional amount interest rate swap to hedge certain of its higher rate fhlbp advances 
the swap had the effect of converting the higher fixed rate advances to lower adjustable rate borrowings  which positively impacts the company s net interest margin in the current interest rate environment 
further  since the company is positively gapped  if the balance sheet were to remain static  future increases should have similar impacts to the earnings and costs of the interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring an institution s interest sensitivity gap 
an interest sensitivity gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities re pricing within a defined period and is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets re pricing within a defined period 
to provide a more accurate one year gap position of the company  certain deposit classifications are based on the interest rate sensitive attributes and not on the contractual re pricing characteristics of these deposits 
management estimates  based on historical trends of the bank s deposit accounts  that a portion of money market  now accounts and savings deposits are partially sensitive to interest rate changes 
accordingly  the interest sensitive portions of these deposits are classified in the less than one year categories with the remainder spread over a five year period 
deposit products with interest rates based on a particular index  if any  are classified according to the specific re pricing characteristic of the index 
deposit rates other than time deposit rates are variable  and changes in deposit rates are typically subject to local market conditions and management s discretion and are not indexed to any particular rate 
generally  during a period of rising interest rates  a positive gap would result in an increase in net interest income while a negative gap would adversely affect net interest income 
however  the interest sensitivity table that follows does not provide a comprehensive representation of the impact of interest rate changes on net interest income 
each category of assets or liabilities will not be affected equally or simultaneously by changes in the general level of interest rates 
even assets and liabilities  which contractually re price within the same period may not  in fact  re price at the same price or the same time or with the same frequency 
it is also important to consider that the table represents a specific point in time 
asset liability management is a dynamic process that is actively monitored and managed and thus variations can occur as the company adjusts the interest sensitivity position for the bank throughout the year

operating results interest income taxable equivalent basis see table reconciliation on page interest income is analyzed on a tax equivalent basis  ie  an adjustment is made for analysis purposes only  to increase interest income by the amount of savings of federal income taxes  which the company realizes by investing in certain tax free municipal securities and by making loans to certain tax exempt organizations 
in this way  the ultimate economic impact of earnings from various assets can be more readily compared 
total interest income decreased million to million from million for the years ended june  and  respectively 
the reduction was attributed largely to a decline on the yield on both loans and investments 
a year over year comparison for the twelve months ended june  and shows a decline in the yield on loans of to and a decline in the yield on investments of to 
these declines are in line with the general movement in market interest rates 
the impact of the aforementioned decline in yields was partially offset by increases in average outstanding loan and investment balances of million and million  respectively 
total interest income decreased to million during fiscal  a million or decrease over the prior fiscal year 
this was due to a million decrease in interest income because of lower average rates during the period which was offset  in part  by a million increase in the average balance of interest earning assets which contributed thousand of additional interest income 
the weighted average yield on average interest earning assets was  and for fiscal  and  respectively  reflecting the decline in general market rates of interest throughout the periods 
interest expense total interest expense decreased million to million from million for the years ended june  and  respectively 
the primary reason for the decline is due to a reduction in the cost of interest bearing deposits due to both the general decline in market interest rates as well as the bank s focused effort to shift the deposit mix from higher costing certificates of deposit to lower costing core deposits demand deposits  savings and money market accounts 
this reduction was partially offset by an increase in average outstanding interest bearing deposit balances as well as average outstanding borrowing balances 
total interest expense decreased to million during fiscal  a million or decrease over fiscal the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to a significant decrease in rates resulting in a million decrease in interest expense  which was offset  in part  by an increase in average balances for deposits and borrowings resulting in an increase in interest expense of thousand 
the average rate paid on deposits and repurchase agreements decreased to for fiscal from for the previous fiscal year while the average rate paid on borrowings decreased to for fiscal net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income on interest earning assets and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income  on a fully tax equivalent basis  declined by thousand due principally to the fact that the bank had more assets re price during the year as compared to the re pricing of interest bearing liabilities 
the yield on interest earning assets declined by  from to from fiscal as compared to fiscal during the same period  the cost of interest bearing liabilities declined by  from to 
net interest income  on a fully tax equivalent basis  increased  or million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the net interest margin  on a fully tax equivalent basis  was for the year ended june   compared to in fiscal provision for loan losses the company s provision for loan losses was thousand  thousand and thousand  during fiscal  and  respectively 
these additions to the allowance for loan losses are due to the company s continued focus on building a larger portfolio of commercial and industrial loans  which typically carry a greater risk of loss than the company s traditional loan portfolios  such as mortgages and real estate loans 
this change in the character of the loan portfolio  the current depressed economic conditions and management s assessment of the inherent risk of loss existing in the loan portfolio determined the amount necessary to increase the allowance for loan losses to an appropriate level 
at june   the allowance for loan losses totaled million or of net loans compared to million or of net loans at june  the company establishes provisions for loan losses  which are charged to operations  in order to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level which management believes covers all known and inherent losses in the loan portfolio 
in establishing the provision  management considers among other things  the portfolio mix  delinquency trends  volume of non performing loans  volume of classified loans and historical loss experience of the portfolio as well as current economic conditions  and other relevant factors 
although management believes it has used the best information available to it in making such determinations  and that the present allowance for loan losses is adequate  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary  and net income may be adversely affected if the circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in determining the level of the allowance for loan losses 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the bank s allowance for losses on loans 
such agencies may require the company to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination 
non interest income total non interest income increased by million or to million for the year ended june  compared to the prior fiscal year 
the primary reason for the increase was due to an increase in deposit service fees of thousand  as the bank continued  during fiscal year  to increase its core deposit base  which deposits are traditionally more fee oriented as compared to certificates of deposit and an increase in gains realized upon the sale of securities available for sale of thousand 
also contributing to the increase was a reduction of thousand in investment security impairment write downs to thousand compared to thousand in the prior year 
during the year  the bank recorded a thousand loss on an other than temporary impairment write down of a revenue bond backed by the revenue stream of a public play golf course in bedford county  pennsylvania 
this compares to the thousand in the prior year detailed below 
total non interest income decreased thousand or to million for the year ended june   compared to the prior fiscal year 
the principal reason for this decrease was a thousand impairment loss on a low income housing revenue bond and a thousand impairment loss on a revenue bond involving a building and related property that are leased to various agencies of the commonwealth of pennsylvania 
these losses totaling thousand were offset by the following investment services income increased thousand or to million  service charges and fees increased thousand or because of increased activity  gains on the sale of loans increased thousand  gains on available for sale securities increased thousand  and other income increased thousand 
these security gains were offset by a decrease in gains on trading account securities of thousand 
operating expenses total operating expenses increased by million or to million for the year ended june  as compared to million for the fiscal year salaries and employee benefits increased thousand or to million from million for the year ended june  compared to the prior year ended june  in addition to normal salary increases  the increase is due largely to having a full years salary for the kennett square branch opened in february as well as salaries for the eagle branch opened in fiscal additionally  management infrastructure was added to further accommodate the shift to a commercial bank 
occupancy and equipment increased thousand or from fiscal to due primarily to the aforementioned branch expansions 
other operating expenses increased by thousand or from million for the year ended june  as compared to million for the year ended june  the increase is due largely to increased legal costs of thousand resulting from the lawsuit instituted by a former employee see legal matters page  increased state of pennsylvania shares tax due to the increased net worth of the bank as well as an increased period of assessment due to the timing of the commercial bank conversion  increased audit and tax fees resultant from additional outsourced internal audit functions and increased insurance costs in line with that experienced within the insurance industry 
total operating expenses decreased thousand or to million for the year ended june  compared to fiscal the decrease in operating expenses over the prior fiscal year was primarily due to a decrease of thousand or in advertising expenses relating to print advertising because the company moved to a more cost effective  proactive direct sales approach 
other expenses decreased by thousand or due to decreases in consulting  printing  donations  supplies and other expenses 
these decreases were offset in part by an increase of thousand or in salaries and employee benefits resulting from normal salary adjustments effective july   additional officer level staff  bonuses and the general increase in employee benefit costs 
also  occupancy and equipment expense increased thousand or resulting from the expansion of the company s corporate headquarters and the addition of a new branch office in kennett square 
income taxes income tax expense for the year ended june  was million  an effective tax rate of as compared to an effective tax rate of for fiscal year the increase in the effective tax rate was the result of a lower portion of the company s pre tax income being comprised of tax free interest income 
pre tax income was comparable from fiscal to fiscal the company incurred income tax expense of million during fiscal the primary reason for the increase in income tax expense in fiscal compared to fiscal of  was due to higher pre tax income and a lower portion of the company s pre tax income being comprised of tax free interest income 
capital resources total assets at june  aggregated million as compared to million at june   a increase year on year 
the increase is due principally to a million increase in outstanding loans receivable including loans held for sale  a million increase in investment securities and a million increase in other assets resulting primarily from the purchase of the boli 
these increases were offset by a million reduction in cash and cash equivalents as funds were deployed in higher earning assets 
total liabilities increased million from june  to june  driven primarily from deposit growth of million  primarily in the lower costing core deposits 
additionally  securities sold under repurchase agreements repurchase agreements increased million as more commercial customers took advantage of this relatively new product 
the deposit and repurchase agreement increases were partially offset by a reduction in fhlbp advances of million 
the company s assets totaled million at june   as compared with million as of june   principally due to a million increase in loans receivable  net to million from million at june  combined with a million increase in cash and cash equivalents from million at june  to million at june  these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in investment securities from million at june  to million at june  liabilities increased million 
borrowings increased million from at june  to million at june  and the company issued million of trust preferred securities 
these increases were used to replace deposits as a funding source by million as deposits decreased from million at june  to million at june  as well as to fund the increase in assets noted above 
the decline in deposits primarily resulted from decreases in higher rate municipal deposits in connection with the implementation of the company s business plan 
stockholders equity increased million at june  to million from million at june  the increase is due primarily to net income for the year ended june  of million  the issuance of common stock aggregating million and changes in the unrealized gain loss of securities available for sale of million 
these increases were offset by the payment of cash dividends totaling million and the repurchase of common stock totaling thousand 
stockholders equity increased million to million at june   from million at june   as a result of net income earned of million during fiscal  and proceeds totaling  from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options 
the increase in stockholders equity also reflected the effect of a decrease in the net unrealized loss on the value of securities available for sale of  the net unrealized loss of million at june  declined to a net unrealized loss of  at june  the increases in equity were offset in part by the payment of cash dividends of million as well as the cost of repurchasing shares of our common stock totaling of  and the payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares in connection with the stock dividend paid during fiscal the accounting treatment of capital securities issued by subsidiary trusts of bank holding companies is currently under review with respect to fin the capital securities are currently included in the tier capital of the company and  at june   amounted to of its tier capital 
depending on the accounting resolution  capital securities issued by certain subsidiary trusts may no longer qualify for tier capital treatment  but instead may qualify for tier capital treatment 
capital securities  which were outstanding prior to the effectiveness of fin may or may not be grandfathered by the federal reserve board for treatment as tier capital for regulatory purposes 
on july   the federal reserve board issued a supervision and regulation letter requiring that bank holding companies continue to follow the current instructions for reporting capital securities in their regulatory reports 
the effect of the letter is that we will continue to report our capital securities in tier capital until further notice from the federal reserve board 

as noted above  at june   the company was classified as well capitalized for regulatory purposes  the highest classification 
the company s classification would have remained well capitalized were the capital securities issued by subsidiary trust not included in its tier capital 
asset quality non performing loans totaled million at june   compared to thousand at june  non performing loans to total assets was at june   compared to 
at june  non performing loans at june   consisted of residential mortgage loans in the amount of thousand  as well as a single commercial real estate loan in the amount of million 
although the loan is current in the payment of interest as it has been due and the next quarterly interest payment is backed by a letter of credit from an independent bank  the loan was placed on non accrual as principal was not repaid in accordance with the original stated maturity  as the borrower has encountered financial difficulties  the underlying real estate is outside the bank s primary lending area and repayment is dependent upon factors not under the complete control of the borrower 
if this loan is excluded from non accrual loans  the ratio of non accrual loans to total assets at june  is as compared to at june  the company had no reo property at june  or at june  at june  and  the company s classified loans  which consisted of loans classified as substandard  doubtful  loss  and reo  totaled million and million  respectively 
included in the assets classified substandard at june  and  were all loans days past due and loans which are less than days delinquent  but inadequately protected by the current paying capacity of the borrower or of the collateral pledged  as well as a well defined weakness that may jeopardize the liquidation of the debt 
the large increase of million reflects a change in management s philosophy to be more diligent in the loan review process in order to more closely monitor and identify problem loans in their early stages to minimize any future potential losses to the company 
as noted above  excluding the single out of area commercial real estate loan  non accrual loans to total loans approximated that at june  additionally  total loans delinquent days or more to outstanding loans approximate at june  in addition to non performing loans and reo  classified assets include are four non rated pennsylvania municipal authority bonds that have been classified as substandard 
these bonds were originally purchased during the period from june through june the aggregate book value of the bonds  after write downs of million thousand and thousand for the years ended june  and  respectively  are million 
two of the three bonds with an aggregate book value of million are zero coupon bonds with maturities extending up to both bonds are secured by the revenue streams of commercial office buildings  which are leased to various agencies of the commonwealth of pennsylvania under long term lease arrangements with renewal options 
a third bond was issued by the housing authority of chester county and has a book balance of million at an interest rate of and final maturity in june this bond involves low income scattered housing in chester county under a program of the office of housing and urban development hud 
hud has committed to provide additional funds to build additional houses  which would be donated to this bond issues 
the retirement of the bond issue is dependent upon proceeds from either the rental or sale of the existing and additional houses 
this bond is on non accrual at june  the fourth bond has a book value of million at an interest rate of approximately and a final maturity of december  this bond is secured by the revenue stream generated by an hole public play golf course located in bedford county  pennsylvania 
the wet weather experienced in the mid atlantic united states has negatively impacted the cash flow of the golf course and the bond is now in technical default 
during the year ended june   this bond was written down by thousand to its estimated market value less liquidation costs 
this bond is on non accrual at june  these classified investments are closely monitored and fairly stated at june  based on available information 
there can be no assurance that further subsequent adverse or positive developments may occur  in which case  additional adjustments to these investments may be forthcoming 
liquidity and capital resources management monitors liquidity daily and maintains funding sources to meet unforeseen changes in cash requirements 
the company s primary sources of funds are deposits  borrowings  repayments  prepayments and maturities of outstanding loans and mortgage backed securities  sales of assets available for sale  maturities and calls of investment securities and other short term investments  and funds provided from operations 
while scheduled loan and mortgage backed securities repayments and maturing investment securities and short term investments are relatively predictable sources of funds  deposit flows  loan prepayments and callable investments are greatly influenced by the movement of interest rates in general  economic conditions and competition 
the company manages the pricing of its deposits to maintain a deposit balance deemed appropriate and desirable 
although the company s deposits represent the majority of its total liabilities  the company has also utilized other borrowing sources  namely fhlbp advances 
in addition to its ability to obtain advances from the fhlbp under several different credit programs  the company has established a line of credit with the fhlbp  in an amount of million 
this line of credit is available for liquidity purposes 
at june  there was no outstanding balance on this line of credit 
liquidity management is both a daily and long term function 
excess liquidity is generally invested in short term investments such as fhlbp overnight deposits 
on a longer term basis  the company maintains a strategy of investing in various lending and investment securities products 
during the year ended june   the company used its sources of funds to primarily fund loan commitments and maintain a substantial portfolio of investment securities  and to meet its ongoing commitments to pay maturing savings certificates and savings withdrawals 
as of june   the company had million in commitments to fund loan originations 
the company anticipates that the majority of these commitments will be funded by december  in addition  as of june   the company had undisbursed loans in process for construction loans of million and million in undisbursed lines of credit 
the company has also issued million in commercial letters of credit fully secured by deposit accounts or real estate at june  the management of the company believes that the company has adequate resources  including principal prepayments and repayments of loans and investment securities and borrowing capacity  to fund all of its commitments to the extent required 
for regulatory purposes  liquidity is defined as a ratio of cash and certain marketable securities that can be readily converted into cash to total deposits and short term borrowings

to that end  management actively monitors and manages its interest rate risk exposure 
market interest rates have steadily declined beginning in december resulting in the lowest interest rate environment in over years 
as a result  loans  which are linked to an index such as the london interbank offered rate libor or prime rate  were re priced at lower interest rates and deposit products have re priced as deposits rates are adjusted 
the principal source of deposits  the certificates of deposit  will adjust only when they mature and are renewed by the customers 
the company s profitability is affected by fluctuations in interest rates 
a sudden and substantial change in interest rates may adversely impact the company s earnings to the extent that the yields on interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities do not change at the same speed  to the same extent  or on the same basis 
the company monitors the impact of changes in interest rates between assets and liabilities as discussed in the asset liability management in item hereof 
although interest rate sensitivity gap analysis is a useful measurement tool and contributes towards effective asset liability management  it is difficult to predict the effect of changing interest rates based solely on that measure 
the company utilizes an income simulation modeling to measure the company s interest rate risk and to manage its interest rate sensitivity 
income simulation considers not only the impact of changing market interest rates on forecasted net interest income  but also other factors such as yield curve relationships  the volume and mix of assets and liabilities  customer preferences and general market conditions 
through the use of income simulation modeling the company is able to calculate an estimate of net interest income for the year ending june   based upon the assets  liabilities and off balance sheet financial instruments in existence at june  the company has also estimated changes to that estimated net interest income based upon interest rates rising or falling in monthly increments rate ramps 
rate ramps assume that all interest rates increase or decrease in monthly increments evenly throughout the period modeled 
economic value of equity eve estimates the discounted present value of asset and liability cash flows 
discount rates are based upon market prices for comparable assets and liabilities 
upward and downward rate shocks are used to measure volatility in relation to such interest rate movements in relation to an unchanged environment 
this method of measurement primarily evaluates the longer term re pricing risks and options in the company s balance sheet 
the following table reflects the estimated economic value of equity at risk and the ratio of eve adjusted equity to eve adjusted assets at june   resulting from shocks to interest rates 
year ended june  change in interest economic value rates in basis points of equity eve ratio eve equity rate shock amount change change eve assets change dollars in thousands static  certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurements 
modeling changes in net present value npv require the making of certain assumptions  which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
in this regard  the npv table presented above assumes that the composition of the company s interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or re pricing of specific assets and liabilities 
accordingly  although the npv table provides an indication of the company s interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on the company s net interest income and will differ from actual results 
the company s primary objective in managing interest rate risk is to minimize the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on the company s net interest income and capital  while structuring the company s asset liability structure to obtain the maximum yield cost spread on that structure 
the company relies primarily on its asset liability structure to control interest rate risk 
the company continually evaluates interest rate risk management opportunities  including the use of derivative financial instruments 
at june   the company was positively gapped whereby its interest earning assets were re pricing at a quicker rate than its interest bearing liabilities 
to partially offset the negative impact of the current low market interest rate environment  the company entered into a million notional amount interest rate swap to hedge certain of its higher rate fhlbp advances 
the swap had the effect of converting the higher fixed rate advances to lower adjustable rate borrowings  which positively impacts the company s net interest margin in the current interest rate environment 
further  since the company is positively gapped  if the balance sheet were to remain static  future increases should have similar impacts to the earnings and costs of the interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities
