the corporate headquarters of the company is in cleveland  ohio 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements of the company include accounts of the company and all majority owned subsidiaries where the company has financial or operational control 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires the company to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes 
in preparing these financial statements  the company has identified certain critical accounting policies which are subject to judgment and uncertainties 
the company has used its best judgment to determine estimates of certain amounts included in the financial statements as a result of these policies  giving due consideration to materiality 
as a result of uncertainties surrounding these events at the time the estimates are made  actual results could differ from these estimates causing adjustments to be made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information 
the accounting policies that the company believes contain uncertainties that are considered critical to understanding the consolidated financial statements are discussed below 
the policies discussed below are reviewed on a regular basis by the company and have been discussed with the company s audit committee of the board of directors 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company records allowances for probable uncollectible rent receivables from commercial tenants based on an estimate of the amount of the receivables that will not be realized from cash receipts in subsequent periods 
this estimate is calculated based on a three year history of early tenant lease terminations as well as an estimate for expected activity of current tenants in the case of the straight line rent adjustments 
there is a risk that the company s estimate of the expected activity of current tenants may not accurately reflect future events 
if the estimate does not accurately reflect future tenant vacancies  the reserve for straight line rent receivable may be over or understated by the actual tenant vacancies that occur 
the company s allowance for doubtful accounts at january   and was   and  respectively 
notes receivable during the years ended january  and  the company reduced reserves previously recorded on certain notes receivable at certain syndicated residential properties 
these reserves were reduced due to the occurrence of a series of events 
in the course of evaluation of these events and their effect on the collectibility of the notes  the company used estimates 
these estimates included  but were not limited to  estimated appraisal values as well as future cash flows at these properties 
these estimates can be affected by market conditions at the time that will not only affect the appraisal value but operating cash flow projections 
had different estimates been applied  the amount of the reserves reversed might have been different than the amounts actually recorded 
for the years ended january  and  the company reduced reserves of  and  respectively 
economic lives depreciation and amortization is generally computed on a straight line method over the estimated useful life of the asset 
tenant improvements are amortized over the life of the tenant s lease 
the estimated useful lives of buildings are primarily years 
this estimate is based on the length of time the asset is expected to generate positive operating cash flows 
actual events and circumstances can cause the life of the building to be different than the estimates made 
additionally  lease terminations can affect the economic life of the tenant improvements 
the company believes the estimated useful lives of fixed assets are reasonable and follow industry standards 
asset impairment the company reviews its investment portfolio to determine if its carrying costs will be recovered from future cash flows whenever events or changes indicate that recoverability of long lived assets may not be assured 
in cases where the company does not expect to recover its carrying costs  an impairment loss is recorded as a provision for decline in real estate for assets in the company s real estate portfolio pursuant to the guidance established in fasb no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
as part of the analysis to determine if an impairment loss has occurred the company is required to make estimates to determine future operating cash flows 
if different estimates are applied in determining future operating cash flows  such as occupancy rates and rent and expense increases  the company may not record an impairment loss  or may record a greater impairment loss on a property
