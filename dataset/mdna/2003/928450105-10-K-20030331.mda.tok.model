as the tables indicate  historically the company s net sales and net income have typically been the highest in the fourth quarter of each year 
the company s business is seasonal because its sales volume increases significantly during the christmas holiday season and  to a lesser extent  during other holidays in the fall and spring and periods of colder weather in certain sections of the country 
certain of these holidays  including passover  easter  yom kippur and rosh hashanah  may fall in different quarters in different years and could cause the company s quarterly operating results to fluctuate in the future 
however  the company believes that through the vita specialty food acquisitions and the introduction of new non seasonal or counter seasonal products  it can  over time  reduce the variability in its quarterly operating results by increasing sales during the second and third quarters of each year

the  of cash flow provided through operations for the year ending december  is  less than the  provided for the year ending december  this is largely due to the fact that the cash flow made available in the year ending december  due to the reduction of inventory net of associated accounts payable  totaled  thus resulting in a  variance when compared to the net  of cash used in this category for the most recent year
