item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition the bank provides a full range of banking services  including the accepting of demand and time deposits  the making of secured and unsecured loans to individuals and businesses  and the offering of credit cards and debit cards 
in  as in recent prior years  the bank accounted for substantially all of the company s consolidated net income

because the majority of the bank s customers are individuals and small to medium sized businesses located in the counties it serves  management does not believe that the loss of a single customer or group of customers would have a material adverse impact on the bank 
there are no seasonal factors that tend to have any material effect on the bank s business  and the bank does not rely on foreign sources of funds or income 
because the bank operates primarily within the central piedmont region of north carolina  the economic conditions within that area could have a material impact on the company see additional discussion below in the section entitled territory served and competition 
beginning in  first bank insurance began offering non fdic insured investment and insurance products  including mutual funds  annuities  long term care insurance  life insurance  and company retirement plans  as well as financial planning services 
in may  first bank insurance added to its product line when it acquired two insurance agencies that specialized in the placement of property and casualty insurance 
first bank insurance collects commissions for the services it provides 
montgomery data s primary business is to provide electronic data processing services for the bank 
ownership and operation of montgomery data allows the company to do all of its electronic data processing without paying fees for such services to an independent provider 
maintaining its own data processing system also allows the company to adapt the system to its individual needs and to the services and products it offers 
although not a significant source of income  montgomery data has historically made its excess data processing capabilities available to area financial institutions for a fee 
montgomery data now has four outside customers that provided gross revenues of   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
first bancorp financial was organized under the name of first recovery in september of for the purpose of providing a back up data processing site for montgomery data and other financial and non financial clients 
first recovery s back up data processing operations were divested in first bancorp financial now owns and leases the first recovery building 
first bancorp financial periodically purchases parcels of real estate from the bank that were acquired through foreclosure or from branch closings 
the parcels purchased consist of real estate having various purposes 
first bancorp financial actively pursues the sale of these properties 
first bancorp capital trust i was organized in october for the purpose of issuing million in debt securities 
these borrowings are due on november  and were structured as trust preferred capital securities  which qualify as tier i capital for regulatory capital adequacy requirements 
these debt securities are callable by the company at par on any quarterly interest payment date beginning on november  the interest rate on these debt securities adjusts on a quarterly basis at a rate of three month libor plus 
this rate may not exceed through november first montgomery was incorporated on november  first montgomery s business activities are currently limited to the selection and acquisition of real estate in virginia that is leased to the bank for use as bank branches 
first troy was incorporated on may  as a subsidiary of the bank 
upon the formation of first montgomery as a subsidiary of the bank  the bank contributed its interest in first troy to first montgomery  resulting in first troy becoming a subsidiary of first montgomery 
first troy allows the bank to centrally manage a portion of its residential  mortgage  and commercial real estate loan portfolio 
first troy has elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust for tax purposes 
territory served and competition the company s headquarters are located in troy  montgomery county 
the company serves primarily the south central area of the piedmont region of north carolina  with offices in counties 
the following table presents  for each county the company operates in  the number of bank branches operated by the company within each of those counties  the approximate amount of deposits with the company in each county as of december   the company s approximate market share  and the number of bank competitors located in the county 
no 
of deposits market number of county branches in millions share competitors anson cabarrus chatham davidson guilford harnett lee montgomery moore randolph richmond robeson rowan scotland stanly wake wythe  va total  the company s branches and facilities are primarily located in small communities whose economies are based primarily on services  manufacturing and light industry 
although the company s market is predominantly small communities and rural areas  the area is not dependent on agriculture 
textiles  furniture  mobile homes  electronics  plastic and metal fabrication  forest products  food products and cigarettes are among the leading manufacturing industries in the trade area 
leading producers of socks  hosiery and area rugs are located in montgomery county 
the pinehurst area within moore county is a widely known golf resort and retirement area 
the high point area is widely known for its furniture market 
additionally  several of the communities served by the company are bedroom communities serving charlotte and greensboro in addition to smaller cities such as albermarle  asheboro  high point  pinehurst and sanford 
as shown in the table above  approximately of the company s deposit base is in moore county  and  accordingly  material changes in competition  the economy or population of moore county could materially impact the company 
no other county comprises more than of the company s deposit base 
the company competes in its various market areas with  among others  several large interstate bank holding companies that are headquartered in north carolina 
these large competitors have substantially greater resources than the company  including broader geographic markets  higher lending limits and the ability to make greater use of large scale advertising and promotions 
a significant number of interstate banking acquisitions have taken place in the past decade  thus further increasing the size and financial resources of some of the company s competitors  three of which are among the largest bank holding companies in the nation 
moore county  which as noted above comprises a disproportionate share of the company s deposits  is a particularly competitive market  with at least ten other financial institutions having a physical presence 
see supervision and regulation below for a further discussion of regulations in the company s industry that affect competition 
the company competes not only against banking organizations  but also against a wide range of financial service providers  including federally and state chartered savings and loan institutions  credit unions  investment and brokerage firms and small loan or consumer finance companies 
competition among financial institutions of all types is virtually unlimited with respect to legal ability and authority to provide most financial services 
the company also experiences competition from internet banks  particularly as it relates to time deposits 
however  the company believes it has certain advantages over its competition in the areas it serves 
the company seeks to maintain a distinct local identity in each of the communities it serves and actively sponsors and participates in local civic affairs 
most lending and other customer related business decisions can be made without delays often associated with larger systems 
additionally  employment of local managers and personnel in various offices and low turnover of personnel enable the company to establish and maintain long term relationships with individual and corporate customers

the bank continually monitors its loan portfolio to identify areas of concern and to enable management to take corrective action 
lending officers and the board of directors meet periodically to review past due loans and portfolio quality  while assuring that the bank is appropriately meeting the credit needs of the communities it serves 
individual lending officers are responsible for pursuing collection of past due amounts and monitoring any changes in the financial status of the borrowers 
the bank s internal audit department evaluates specific loans and overall loan quality at individual branches as part of its regular branch reviews 
the bank also contracts with an independent consulting firm to review new loan originations meeting certain criteria  as well as assign risk grades to existing credits meeting certain thresholds 
the consulting firm s observations  comments  and risk grades  including variances with the bank s risk grades  are shared with the company s audit committee of the board of directors  and are considered by management in setting bank policy  as well as in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
see allowance for loan losses and loan loss experience in item below 
investment policy and procedures the company has adopted an investment policy designed to optimize the company s income from funds not needed to meet loan demand in a manner consistent with appropriate liquidity and risk objectives

the company may purchase non rated municipal bonds only if such bonds are in the company s general market area and determined by the company to have a credit risk no greater than the minimum ratings referred to above 
industrial development authority bonds  which normally are not rated  are purchased only if they are judged to possess a high degree of credit soundness to assure reasonably prompt sale at a fair value 
in  the company s board of directors authorized the company to invest a portion of its security portfolio in high quality corporate bonds  with the amount of bonds related to any one issuer not to exceed the company s legal lending limit 
prior to purchasing a corporate bond  the company s management performs due diligence on the issuer of the bond  and the purchase is not made unless the company believes that the purchase of the bond bears no more risk to the company than would an unsecured loan to the same company 
the company s investment officers implement the investment policy  monitor the investment portfolio  recommend portfolio strategies  and report to the company s investment committee 
reports of all purchases  sales  issuer calls  net profits or losses and market appreciation or depreciation of the bond portfolio are reviewed by the company s board of directors each month

once a year  the written investment policy is reviewed by the board of directors and the company s portfolio is compared with the portfolios of other companies of comparable size 
mergers and acquisitions as part of its operations  the company has pursued an acquisition strategy over the years to augment its internal growth and regularly evaluates the potential acquisition of  or merger with  and holds discussions with  various financial institutions 
the company s acquisitions to date have generally fallen into one of three categories an acquisition of a financial institution or branch thereof within a market the company operates  an acquisition of a financial institution or branch thereof in a market contiguous to which the company operates  or an acquisition of a company that has products or services that the company does not currently offer 
the company believes that by pursuing these types of acquisition opportunities the company can enhance its earnings by any combination or all of the following achieving cost efficiencies  enhancing the acquiree s earnings or gaining new customers by introducing a more successful banking model with more products and services to the acquiree s market base  increasing customer satisfaction or gaining new customers by providing more locations for the convenience of customers  and leveraging the company s customer base by offering new products and services 
in the last three years  the company has made acquisitions in all three of the aforementioned categories of acquisitions 
in  the company completed the acquisition of a branch within its market geography broadway  located in lee county with approximately million in deposits and million in loans 
in  acquisitions resulted in the company adding million in loans and million in deposits  expansion into three contiguous markets lumberton  pembroke  st 
pauls  provided another branch for customers in one of the company s newer markets salisbury  and gave the company the ability to offer property and casualty insurance coverage 
in addition  the company had two acquisitions pending completion at december  both of which were completed in january  one of which is the acquisition of a financial institution in a market contiguous to a current market  and the other is the acquisition of a property and casualty insurance agency located in montgomery county 
the company plans to continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities that could potentially benefit the company 
this may include acquisitions that do not fit the categories discussed above 
for a further discussion of recent acquisition activity  see merger and acquisition activity under item management s discussion and analysis 
employees as of december   the company had full time and part time employees 
the company is not a party to any collective bargaining agreements and considers its employee relations to be good 
supervision and regulation as a bank holding company  the company is subject to supervision  examination and regulation by the board of governors of the federal reserve system and the north carolina office of the commissioner of banks 
the bank is subject to supervision and examination by the federal deposit insurance corporation and the north carolina office of the commissioner of banks 
see also note to the consolidated financial statements 
supervision and regulation of the company the company is a bank holding company within the meaning of the bank holding company act of  as amended the bank holding company act  and is required to register as such with the board of governors of the federal reserve system the federal reserve board or frb 
the company is also regulated by the north carolina office of the commissioner of banks the commissioner under the bank holding company act of a bank holding company is required to file quarterly reports and other information regarding its business operations and those of its subsidiaries with the federal reserve board 
it is also subject to examination by the federal reserve board and is required to obtain federal reserve board approval prior to making certain acquisitions of other institutions or voting securities 
the commissioner is empowered to regulate certain acquisitions of north carolina banks and bank holding companies  issue cease and desist orders for violations of north carolina banking laws  and promulgate rules necessary to effectuate the purposes of the bank holding company act of regulatory authorities have cease and desist powers over bank holding companies and their nonbank subsidiaries where their actions would constitute a serious threat to the safety  soundness or stability of a subsidiary bank 
those authorities may compel holding companies to invest additional capital into banking subsidiaries upon acquisition or in the event of significant loan losses or rapid growth of loans or deposits 
in  the us enacted legislation that allowed bank holding companies to engage in a wider range of non banking activities  including greater authority to engage in securities and insurance activities 
under the gramm leach bliley act the act  a bank holding company that elects to become a financial holding company may engage in any activity that the federal reserve board  in consultation with the secretary of the treasury  determines by regulation or order is i financial in nature  ii incidental to any such financial activity  or iii complementary to any such financial activity and does not pose a substantial risk to the safety or soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally 
this act made significant changes in us banking law  principally by repealing certain restrictive provisions of the glass steagall act 
the act specifies certain activities that are deemed to be financial in nature  including lending  exchanging  transferring  investing for others  or safeguarding money or securities  underwriting and selling insurance  providing financial  investment  or economic advisory services  underwriting  dealing in or making a market in  securities  and any activity currently permitted for bank holding companies by the federal reserve board under section c of the holding company act 
the act does not authorize banks or their affiliates to engage in commercial activities that are not financial in nature 
a bank holding company may elect to be treated as a financial holding company only if all depository institution subsidiaries of the holding company are well capitalized  well managed and have at least a satisfactory rating under the community reinvestment act 
at the present time  the company does not anticipate applying for status as a financial holding company under the act 
national and state banks are also authorized by the act to engage  through financial subsidiaries  in any activity that is permissible for a financial holding company as described above and any activity that the secretary of the treasury  in consultation with the federal reserve board  determines is financial in nature or incidental to any such financial activity  except i insurance underwriting  ii real estate development or real estate investment activities unless otherwise permitted by law  iii insurance company portfolio investments and iv merchant banking 
the authority of a national or state bank to invest in a financial subsidiary is subject to a number of conditions  including  among other things  requirements that the bank must be well managed and well capitalized after deducting from the bank s capital outstanding investments in financial subsidiaries 
the act also contained a number of other provisions that affected the company s operations and the operations of all financial institutions 
one of those provisions related to the financial privacy of consumers and authorized federal banking regulators to adopt rules that would limit the ability of banks and other financial entities to disclose non public information about consumers to non affiliated entities 
the rules that have subsequently been adopted by the bank regulators require more disclosure to consumers regarding the privacy of the information they provide  and in some circumstances  require consent by the consumer before information is allowed to be provided to a third party 
these rules took effect on july  the company believes its operations are in compliance with the rules 
the united states congress and the north carolina general assembly have periodically considered and adopted legislation that has resulted in  and could result in further  deregulation of both banks and other financial institutions 
such legislation could modify or eliminate geographic restrictions on banks and bank holding companies and current restrictions on the ability of banks to engage in certain nonbanking activities 
for example  the riegle neal interstate banking act  which was enacted several years ago  allows expansion of interstate acquisitions by bank holding companies and banks 
this and other legislative and regulatory changes have increased the ability of financial institutions to expand the scope of their operations  both in terms of services offered and geographic coverage 
such legislative changes have placed the company in more direct competition with other financial institutions  including mutual funds  securities brokerage firms  insurance companies  investment banking firms  and internet banks 
the company cannot predict what other legislation might be enacted or what other regulations might be adopted or  if enacted or adopted  the effect thereof on the company s business 
supervision and regulation of the bank federal banking regulations applicable to all depository financial institutions  among other things  i provide federal bank regulatory agencies with powers to prevent unsafe and unsound banking practices  ii restrict preferential loans by banks to insiders of banks  iii require banks to keep information on loans to major shareholders and executive officers  and iv bar certain director and officer interlocks between financial institutions 
as a state chartered bank  the bank is subject to the provisions of the north carolina banking statutes and to regulation by the commissioner 
the commissioner has a wide range of regulatory authority over the activities and operations of the bank  and the commissioner s staff conducts periodic examinations of banks and their affiliates to ensure compliance with state banking regulations 
among other things  the commissioner regulates the merger and consolidation of state chartered banks  the payment of dividends  loans to officers and directors  recordkeeping  types and amounts of loans and investments  and the establishment of branches 
the commissioner also has cease and desist powers over state chartered banks for violations of state banking laws or regulations and for unsafe or unsound conduct that is likely to jeopardize the interest of depositors 
the dividends that may be paid by the bank to the company are subject to legal limitations under north carolina law 
in addition  regulatory authorities may restrict dividends that may be paid by the bank or the company s other subsidiaries 
the ability of the company to pay dividends to its shareholders is largely dependent on the dividends paid to the company by its subsidiaries 
the bank is a member of the federal deposit insurance corporation the fdic  which currently insures the deposits of member banks 
for this protection  each bank pays a quarterly statutory assessment  based on its level of deposits  and is subject to the rules and regulations of the fdic 
the fdic also is authorized to approve conversions  mergers  consolidations and assumptions of deposit liability transactions between insured banks and uninsured banks or institutions  and to prevent capital or surplus diminution in such transactions where the resulting  continuing  or assumed bank is an insured nonmember bank 
in addition  the fdic monitors the bank s compliance with several banking statutes  such as the depository institution management interlocks act and the community reinvestment act of the fdic also conducts periodic examinations of the bank to assess its compliance with banking laws and regulations  and it has the power to implement changes in or restrictions on a bank s operations if it finds that a violation is occurring or is threatened 
neither the company nor the bank can predict what other legislation might be enacted or what other regulations might be adopted  or if enacted or adopted  the effect thereof on the bank s operations

item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition management s discussion and analysis is intended to assist readers in understanding the company s results of operations and changes in financial position for the past three years 
this review should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes beginning on page of this report and the supplemental financial data contained in tables through included with this discussion and analysis 
critical accounting policies due to the estimation process and the potential materiality of the amounts involved  the company has identified the accounting for the allowance for loan losses and the related provision for loan losses as an accounting policy critical to the company s financial statements 
the provision for loan losses charged to operations is an amount sufficient to bring the allowance for loan losses to an estimated balance considered adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the portfolio 
management s determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based primarily on a mathematical model that estimates the appropriate allowance for loan losses 
this model has two components 
the first component involves the estimation of losses on loans defined as impaired loans 
a loan is considered to be impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the estimated valuation allowance is the difference  if any  between the loan balance outstanding and the value of the impaired loan as determined by either an estimate of the cash flows that the company expects to receive from the borrower discounted at the loan s effective rate  or in the case of a collateral dependent loan  the fair value of the collateral 
the second component of the allowance model is to estimate losses for all loans not considered to be impaired loans 
first  loans that have been risk graded by the company as having more than standard risk but are not considered to be impaired are assigned estimated loss percentages generally accepted in the banking industry 
loans that are classified by the company as having normal credit risk are segregated by loan type  and estimated loss percentages are assigned to each loan type  based on the historical losses  current economic conditions  and operational conditions specific to each loan type 
the reserve estimated for impaired loans is then added to the reserve estimated for all other loans 
this becomes the company s allocated allowance 
in addition to the allocated allowance derived from the model  management also evaluates other data such as the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans  net loan growth information  nonperforming asset levels and trends in such data 
based on this additional analysis  the company may determine that an additional amount of allowance for loan losses is necessary to reserve for probable losses 
this additional amount  if any  is the company s unallocated allowance 
the sum of the allocated allowance and the unallocated allowance is compared to the actual allowance for loan losses recorded on the books of the company and any adjustment necessary for the recorded allowance to equal the computed allowance is recorded as a provision for loan losses 
while management uses the best information available to make evaluations  future adjustments may be necessary if economic  operational  or other conditions change 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the company s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require the company to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on the examiners judgment about information available to them at the time of their examinations

discussion regarding impact of accounting methods used in mergers and acquisitions while merger and acquisition activity was relatively insignificant in  the years ended december  and were both significantly impacted by merger and acquisition activity  as discussed below 
the merger and acquisition activities for each year were recorded using different methods of accounting 
the different methods of accounting impacted the financial information presented in this form k in different ways 
as previously noted  in the company completed the merger acquisition of first savings bancorp  inc  which just prior to the merger date had total assets equaling of the company s total assets and had more shareholders equity than the company 
because this merger was accounted for under pooling of interests accounting  the financial reporting rules required that the company restate all historical financial results by retroactively combining the past results that each company achieved separately and presenting them as the company s historical financial results as if the two companies had always operated together 
therefore  except in specifically noted circumstances  there is no incremental impact to the company s financial information presented herein that can be discerned as a result of the acquisition of first savings 
the company s one acquisition in and all four acquisitions in see discussion below were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
the purchase method of accounting requires that the assets and liabilities acquired be reflected as part of the company s assets and liabilities as of the date of the acquisition 
therefore  the incremental impact of each of the acquisitions since is more evident 
other significant differences in pooling of interests accounting and purchase accounting relate to the treatment of certain merger expenses and the method of recording the assets and liabilities of the acquired entity  as discussed in the following two paragraphs 
in accordance with pooling of interests accounting  all merger costs eg attorney fees  investment banker fees  accounting fees  employment contract payments related to the first savings acquisition were recognized as expense in the income statement 
conversely  purchase accounting requires that the direct costs related to a merger be treated as part of the purchase price of the acquisition  and therefore all such direct merger costs were effectively capitalized and increased the amount of goodwill recorded in each purchase transaction 
in accordance with pooling of interests accounting  the company recorded the acquisition of first savings using the historical cost basis for all of first savings assets and liabilities 
the excess of the assets over liabilities recorded ie first savings shareholders equity was added to the shareholders equity of the company 
the value of the stock that the company issued as merger consideration was not considered in the accounting entries  and therefore under pooling of interests accounting  no intangible assets were recognized 
under the purchase accounting method used for the company s and acquisitions  the company valued all assets and liabilities of the acquired entities at their fair market value 
because for each of the company s and acquisitions  the value of the consideration paid exceeded the net fair market value of its assets less its liabilities  intangible assets were recorded for the differences between the two 
merger and acquisition activity over the past three fiscal years  the company has completed several acquisitions and had one branch divestiture 
significant amounts of intangible assets have been recorded in connection with the company s acquisitions  as detailed below 
the accounting for intangible assets changed significantly in with the company being required under new accounting standards to cease the amortization of virtually all of its intangible assets 
see the section entitled current accounting matters below and note and note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding intangible assets and their amortization under previous and new accounting standards 
the company completed one acquisition in as follows a broadway branch purchase on october   the company completed the purchase of a branch of rbc centura located in broadway  north carolina 
the company assumed the branch s million in deposits and million in loans 
the primary reason for this acquisition was to increase the company s presence in lee county  a market that the company already had two branches in with a large customer base 
an intangible asset of million  all of which was allocated to goodwill  was recorded in connection with this acquisition 
the company s acquisitions completed during were as follows a salisbury branch purchase on december   the company completed the purchase of a branch of first union national bank located in salisbury  north carolina 
the company assumed the branch s million in deposits and million in loans 
an intangible asset of million was recorded in connection with this acquisition 
b insurance agency acquisitions on may   the company completed the purchase of two insurance agencies aberdeen insurance realty company and hobbs insurance and realty company 
both agencies were located in moore county and specialized in placing property and casualty insurance coverage for individuals and businesses in the moore county area 
in completing the acquisition  the agencies were merged into first bank insurance services  inc approximately  shares of company stock were issued in connection with the acquisition of the two agencies 
an intangible asset of  was recorded in connection with the acquisition 
c century bancorp  inc on may   the company completed the purchase of century bancorp  inc century 
century was the holding company for home savings  inc  ssb  a one branch savings institution located in thomasville  nc 
century had total assets of million  total loans of million  and total deposits of million 
in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement  the company issued approximately  shares of common stock and paid cash of approximately million to century shareholders in exchange for all shares of century outstanding 
an intangible asset of million was recorded in connection with this acquisition 
d robeson and scotland counties branch purchase on march   the company completed the purchase of four branches from first union national bank with aggregate deposits of approximately million and aggregate loans of approximately million 
the four branches acquired were in lumberton  pembroke  st 
pauls all located in robeson county  nc  and laurinburg scotland county  nc 
total intangible assets of million were recorded in connection with the purchase 
as discussed above  each of the above transactions was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
the following table presents a summary of the fair market value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the purchases described above robeson and salisbury insurance scotland assets acquired branch agencies century counties branches total in millions cash securities loans  gross allowance for loan losses premises and equipment other total assets acquired liabilities assumed deposits borrowings other total liabilities assumed value of cash paid and or stock issued to stock holders of acquiree n a n a intangible assets recorded there are many factors that the company considers when evaluating how much to offer for potential acquisition candidates in the form of a purchase price comprised of cash and or stock for a whole company purchase or a deposit premium in a branch purchase 
most significantly  the company compares expectations of future earnings per share on a stand alone basis with projected future earnings per share assuming completion of the acquisition under various pricing scenarios 
significant assumptions that affect this analysis include the estimated future earnings stream of the acquisition candidate  the amount of cost efficiencies that can be realized  and the interest rate earned lost on the cash received paid 
in addition to the earnings per share comparison  the company also considers other factors including but not limited to marketplace acquisition statistics  location of the candidate in relation to the company s expansion strategy  market growth potential  management of the candidate  potential integration issues including corporate culture  and the size of the acquisition candidate 
the generally higher amounts of intangible assets recorded relative to assets and deposits acquired in the branch purchases shown above compared to the century acquisition are primarily a result of the branches having a higher relative earnings stream  due largely to having a higher mix of transaction oriented deposit accounts that carried low interest rates and high potential for service charge income 
the lone acquisition during was the september  merger acquisition of first savings bancorp  inc the holding company for first savings bank of moore county  ssb collectively referred to as first savings 
each share of first savings stock was exchanged for shares of the company s stock  resulting in the company issuing approximately  shares of stock to complete the transaction 
at june   first savings had total assets of million  with loans of million and deposits of million 
to gain federal reserve approval for the merger with first savings  the company was required to divest the first savings bank branch located in carthage  nc 
this branch was sold to another north carolina community bank in a transaction that was completed in november at the time of the divestiture  the carthage branch had approximately million in total deposits and million in total loans 
the sale of the branch resulted in a net gain of the company had two pending acquisitions as of december   as follows a uwharrie insurance group on october   the company announced that its insurance subsidiary  first bank insurance  had reached an agreement to acquire uwharrie insurance group  a montgomery county based property and casualty insurance agency 
with eight employees  uwharrie insurance group  inc serves approximately  customers  primarily from its troy based headquarters  and has annual commissions of approximately  the primary reason for the acquisition was to gain efficiencies of scale with the company s existing property and casualty insurance business 
the transaction was completed on january   with the company paying cash in the amount of  the tangible assets of uwharrie insurance group on the date of acquisition were approximately  which resulted in the company recording an intangible asset of approximately  the company is currently in the process of determining what portion of the intangible asset will be allocated to identifiable intangible assets and what portion will be allocated as goodwill 
b on july   the company reported that it had agreed to acquire carolina community bancshares  inc ccb  a south carolina community bank with total assets of approximately million 
ccb operates out of three branches in dillon county  south carolina  with its headquarters and one of its branches located in latta  and two branches in the city of dillon 
this represents the company s first entry into south carolina 
dillon county  south carolina is contiguous to robeson county  north carolina  a county where the company operates four branches 
the terms of the agreement called for shareholders of carolina community to receive shares of first bancorp stock and in cash for each share of carolina community stock they owned 
the transaction was completed on january  with the company paying cash of million  issuing  shares of common stock valued at approximately million  and assuming employee stock options with an intrinsic value of approximately million  for a total deal value of approximately million 
the following is a condensed unaudited balance sheet  as reported by ccb  as of the acquisition date of january  ccb assets in millions cash and cash equivalents securities loans  gross allowance for loan losses premises and equipment intangible assets other total assets liabilities deposits borrowings other total liabilities shareholders equity total liabilities and shareholders equity analysis of results of operations net interest income  the spread between earnings on interest earning assets and the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities  constitutes the largest source of the company s earnings 
other factors that significantly affect operating results are the provision for loan losses  noninterest income such as service fees and noninterest expenses such as salaries  occupancy expense  equipment expense and other overhead costs  as well as the effects of income taxes 
note regarding pro forma information in an effort to enhance the comparability of the core operating results of the company between years  the company has presented certain pro forma financial data in table selected consolidated financial data and at various times in the discussion below will refer to pro forma data 
in table  the pro forma data is presented as adjustments to reported earnings  with the resulting pro forma diluted earnings per share shown 
performance ratios have not been adjusted to reflect the effects of the pro forma data 
two types of pro forma adjustments have been made 
the first adjustment identifies the net after tax effects of unusual or nonrecurring gains or losses 
examples of these types of items are merger expenses  securities gains losses  fixed asset gains losses  and foreclosed property gains losses 
these types of gains or losses occur at irregular intervals and are not considered by the company to be an indication of the core operating results of the company 
to eliminate the effects of these nonrecurring items  net gains are deducted from reported income and net losses are added to reported income 
in the past five years  only net income for the year included nonrecurring income or expense that impacted net income by more than 
the results of operations for the year were significantly impacted by the company s merger acquisition of first savings 
in connection with this acquisition  there were several material nonrecurring items of income and expense related to the transaction  as follows o  in expenses  after tax that were incurred in completing the merger 
these expenses consisted primarily of investment banker fees  attorney fees  employment contract payments  accountant fees  and early termination fees associated with vendor contracts 
these expenses were all recorded in the third quarter of o  in losses  after tax from sales of securities 
the merger with first savings increased the company s liability sensitive position 
to reduce the company s interest rate risk exposure  approximately million in securities were sold at a total loss of  the proceeds from the sale were first used to repay short term debt  with the remaining proceeds invested in investments with a shorter average life and a higher yield than the securities sold 
o  was recorded  after tax as a one time adjustment to the allowance for loan losses during the third quarter of this provision for loan losses was recorded in order to align the credit risk methodologies of the company and first savings 
o  was realized as a gain  after tax from the sale of the company s carthage branch during the fourth quarter of the sale of this branch was a regulatory requirement for approval of the merger with first savings 
the following table presents a summary of items for each of the past three years that the company considers to be nonrecurring in nature 
the impact on net income and impact on diluted earnings per share columns reflect the after tax amount of the pro forma data at the blended federal and state tax rate

entitled goodwill and other intangible assets and no 
entitled acquisitions of certain financial institutions 
under these standards  as of january   the company was required to cease the systematic amortization as expense of virtually all of its intangible assets 
the elimination of this type of expense for but not for previous years as required by the standards affects the comparability of the company s financial results between and all previous years 
to enhance comparability  in table for years prior to  the after tax effect of the amortization of intangible assets that were no longer amortized beginning in is shown as a positive adjustment to adjust the company s net income for each year to reflect what it would have been had the new accounting standards been applicable to previous years 
the following table presents gross amortization expense for each of the past three years  along with the amounts of amortization expense related to intangible assets that ceased to be amortized beginning on january  the table also includes the after tax effects on net income and diluted earnings per share associated with this amortization expense that represents the additional amounts the company would have reported had the amortization provisions of statements and been applicable in those years 
impact on diluted amortization earnings per share expense related to of amortization intangible assets expense related to gross amortization expense related that ceased to be intangible assets amortization to intangible assets that amortized on that ceased to be expense ceased to be amortized on january   amortized on recorded january  net of taxes january  in thousands  except per share data overview compared to net income for the year ended december  amounted to  or per diluted share  a increase in diluted earnings per share over the per diluted share for the year ended december  as noted above  in  in accordance with the adoption of two new accounting standards  the company discontinued the amortization of most of its intangible assets 
if the newly adopted standards had been applicable in  the company would have recorded additional net income of  or approximately per diluted share  for the twelve months ended december  nonrecurring items of income expense were insignificant for the year ended december   while nonrecurring gains of approximately one cent per share were realized for the twelve months ended december  adjusting for the pro forma items discussed in the paragraph above and in the section entitled note regarding pro forma information above  the company s pro forma net income for amounted to  a increase from pro forma net income for of  pro forma diluted earnings per share for remained unchanged from the unadjusted reported amount of per share  higher than pro forma diluted earnings per share of for the most significant factor in the company s increase in net income from to was an million  or  increase in net interest income 
as discussed in more detail below in the section entitled net interest income  the increase in net interest income was a result of a higher level of average earning assets and a higher net interest margin 
average earning assets increased in  while the company s net interest margin tax equivalent net interest income divided by average earning assets increased from in to in partially offsetting the increase in net interest income was a higher provision for loan losses 
although asset quality ratios generally improved in  the company s provision for loan losses more than doubled due to high loan growth  amounting to  in compared to  in in  first bancorp experienced million in internal loan growth compared to million in noninterest income increased and noninterest expense increased in compared to  primarily as a result of the company s growth  including a full year s impact of the acquisitions completed in noninterest income was also positively affected in by increased mortgage loan refinancing activity that increased mortgage origination fees  as well as the offering of a check overdraft product beginning in august that increased fees earned on deposit accounts for a full months in the increase in noninterest expenses was partially offset by the near elimination of amortization expense related to intangible assets 
as noted above in the section entitled note regarding pro forma information  in the company adopted two new accounting standards that required the company to cease amortization of virtually all of its intangible assets 
excluding amortization expense in related to intangible assets that ceased to be amortized in  the company s noninterest expenses increased in the company s income taxes increased from  in to  in the increase in income tax expense was a result of higher income before income taxes 
the effective tax rate for both years was approximately 
overview compared to net income for the year ended december  amounted to  a increase from the  recorded for diluted earnings per share for amounted to  a increase from the reported for as discussed above  net income for was significantly impacted by the merger with first savings 
adjusting for the pro forma items discussed above  pro forma net income for the year ended december  amounted to  a increase from the  in pro forma net income for diluted earnings per share on a pro forma basis for amounted to  a increase from the pro forma diluted earnings per share amount of for the company s net income and most individual components of net income for were significantly impacted by the acquisitions completed during the year 
as a result of the acquisitions  the company s loans increased by million and deposits increased by million  whereas internally generated loan and deposit growth amounted to only million and million  respectively 
as a result of the incremental impact of these acquired loans and deposits  net interest income for the year increased despite a decrease in the net interest margin from in to in the provision for loan losses for amounted to  which is comparable to the recurring provision for loan losses of  recorded in the amount excludes the one time  acquisition related provision previously discussed 
the slightly lower provision in compared to the recurring provision was a result of lower net internal loan growth in in  the company s net internal loan growth amounted to million compared to million in an increase in nonperforming assets during increased what otherwise would have been an even lower level of provision for loan losses in the incremental impact of the acquisitions also contributed significantly to the increase in noninterest income increase on a pro forma basis when nonrecurring gains losses are excluded and the increase in noninterest expenses from the amounts recorded in increase on a pro forma basis 
also increasing noninterest income in were increased fees earned from presold mortgages  which benefited from a lower interest rate environment  and the introduction of a deposit product in august which  for a fee  allows checking account customers to overdraw their deposit account 
the company s income taxes increased from  in to  in the increase in income tax expense was a result of higher income before income taxes 
the effective tax rate for of was lower than the effective tax rate in  primarily due to nondeductible merger related expenses incurred in that had the effect of increasing the effective tax rate 
net interest income net interest income on a reported basis amounted to  in   in  and  in for internal purposes and in the discussion that follows  the company evaluates its net interest income on a tax equivalent basis by adding the tax benefit realized from tax exempt securities to reported interest income 
net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis amounted to  in   in  and  in table analyzes net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis 
the company s net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis increased by in and in there are two primary factors that cause changes in the amount of net interest income recorded by the company growth in loans and deposits  and the company s net interest margin tax equivalent net interest income divided by average interest earning assets 
in both and  net interest income was positively impacted by higher amounts of average loans and deposits outstanding 
table illustrates that the change in the average volume of loans and deposits was the predominant factor in the higher amounts of net interest income realized by the company in and in  the average amount of loans outstanding grew by  while the average amount of deposits increased by 
in  the average amount of loans outstanding increased and the average amount of deposits outstanding increased 
the higher amounts of loans and deposits outstanding in and were a result of both internal growth  as well as growth achieved in corporate acquisitions 
in  most of the loan and deposit growth was achieved in acquisitions  with of the year s million in loan growth and of the year s million deposit growth coming by way of acquisition 
in  the increase in the average amount of loans and deposits outstanding was partially a result of a full year s effect of the growth as well as growth realized in  most all of which was internally generated 
in  loans grew by million  with all but million of the growth internally generated  while deposits grew by million  with all but million internally generated 
the effects on net interest income of the higher amounts of average loans and deposits outstanding in were enhanced by a higher net interest margin in compared to the company s net interest margin for was compared to in the net interest margin for was a decrease from the margin realized in the variations in net interest margin over the past two years have been largely a result of the federal reserve s interest rate policies during that time 
in  the company s interest rate spreads were negatively impacted by the federal reserve board cutting interest rates times totaling basis points 
although at january  the company had more interest sensitive liabilities than interest sensitive assets subject to repricing within twelve months  the company s interest sensitive assets repriced sooner generally the day following the interest rate cut and by a larger percentage generally by the same number of basis points that the federal reserve discount rate was decreased than did the company s interest sensitive liabilities that were subject to repricing 
the company s primary interest sensitive liabilities at january  in the twelve month horizon consisted of the following savings  now  and money market deposits  and time deposits 
interest rates paid on savings  now and money market deposits are set by management of the company  and although the interest rates on these accounts were decreased by the company within days of each of the federal reserve rate cuts  it was not possible to reduce the interest rates by the full amount of the federal reserve cuts due to competitive considerations and the already relatively low rates paid on these types of accounts 
interest rates paid on time deposits are generally fixed and not subject to automatic adjustment 
when time deposits mature  the company has the opportunity  at the customers discretion  to renew the time deposit at a rate set by the company 
because time deposits that are interest sensitive in a twelve month horizon mature throughout the twelve month period  any change in the renewal rate will only affect a portion of the twelve month period 
also  although changes in interest rates on renewing time deposits generally track rate changes in the interest rate environment  the company was not able to decrease rates on renewing time deposits during by the corresponding decreases in the federal reserve discount rate because of competitive pressures in the company s market 
in  there were no changes to interest rates initiated by the federal reserve for the first ten months of the year 
this allowed a significant portion of the company s time deposit portfolio that had been originated when rates were higher to mature and reprice at lower rates as noted above  much of the company s interest sensitive assets had repriced immediately in when the rate cuts were made and did not experience further declines 
the basis point rate cut announced by the federal reserve on november  negatively impacted the company s net interest margin in much the same way as the rate cuts did 
the company s fourth quarter of net interest margin decreased to from the margin realized in the third quarter of another factor affecting the company s net interest margin in and was the reinvestment of funds received in the company s acquisitions and the mix of loans and deposits assumed in the acquisitions 
the march acquisition of four branches from first union national bank resulted in the company receiving million in cash 
the company was not able to immediately redeploy the cash received into a mix of higher yielding investments and loans consistent with the company s historic asset mix  and therefore the company s net interest margin was negatively impacted 
in  due to the high loan growth experienced by the company  a significant portion of this cash was redeployed into loans with higher interest rates than the short term investments in which the cash had been invested 
additionally  in connection with the acquisition of century in may  the company assumed a high mix of residential mortgage loans and time deposits which are generally the lowest yielding type of loan and highest rate type of deposit 
this mix of loans and deposits negatively impacted net interest margins in in  many of century s loans were refinanced by the borrower and then resold in the secondary market by the company  with the resulting funds used to fund the company s commercial loan growth which generally has higher interest rates than residential mortgages 
in addition  many of century s time deposits also had the opportunity to reprice at lower rates in  thus positively impacting the net interest margin 
see additional information regarding net interest income on page in the section entitled interest rate risk 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses charged to operations is an amount sufficient to bring the allowance for loan losses to an estimated balance considered appropriate to absorb probable losses inherent in the portfolio 
management s determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based on the level of loan growth  an evaluation of the portfolio  current economic conditions  historical loan loss experience and other risk factors 
the company recorded provisions for loan losses of  in compared to  in and  in the increase in the provision for loan losses for compared to was primarily a result of higher internal loan growth  as asset quality ratios generally improved during the year 
in  the company generated million in internal loan growth compared to million in internal growth in the remainder of the million in loan growth in and million in loan growth in came by way of acquisitions with a preexisting allocation for loan losses already in place 
the decrease in the provision for loan losses in compared to was impacted by the company s merger with first savings 
as noted earlier  in connection with the merger with first savings  a provision of  was recorded in in order to align the risk methodologies of the two merging companies 
excluding the merger related provision  the company s provision for loan losses was approximately less than the recurring provision of  the decrease in the recurring provision for loan losses was a result of significantly lower loan growth experienced 
net internal loan growth excludes loans assumed in acquisitions for amounted to million compared to million for an increase in nonperforming assets and net charge offs during increased what would have been an otherwise lower level of provision for loan losses in see the section entitled allowance for loan losses and loan loss experience below for a more detailed discussion of the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance is monitored and analyzed regularly in conjunction with the company s loan analysis and grading program  and adjustments are made to maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses 
noninterest income noninterest income recorded by the company amounted to  in   in  and  in noninterest income for was significantly impacted by losses incurred from sales of securities that were partially offset by a gain realized from the sale of a branch 
both the securities losses and the branch sale gain were related to the merger acquisition of first savings see additional discussion below 
as shown in table  core noninterest income  which excludes gains and losses from sales of securities  loans  and other assets  as well as nonrecurrring items  amounted to  in a increase from the  in the core noninterest income of  was higher than the  recorded in see table and the following discussion for an understanding of the components of noninterest income 
service charges on deposit accounts in amounted to  a increase compared to the  recorded in the amount of  was higher than the amount of  in addition to incremental service fee income associated with the company s internally generated deposit growth and periodic deposit rate fee increases  there have been two primary factors driving the high growth in service charges the acquisition of five first union branches during four bank branches were acquired in march and one branch was acquired in december these branches had a high level of transaction accounts non time deposits  million in total  which afforded the company the opportunity to earn deposit service charges  and the introduction of a product in august that charges a fee for allowing customers to overdraw their deposit account 
this product has generated approximately  in fees per month net of related expenses since its introduction 
other service charges  commissions and fees amounted to  in  a increase from the  earned in the amount of  was higher than the  recorded in this category of noninterest income includes items such as safety deposit box rentals  fees from sales of personalized checks  check cashing fees  credit card and merchant income  debit card income  and atm charges 
this category of income grew primarily because of increases in these activity related fee services as a result of overall growth in the company s total customer base  including growth achieved from corporate acquisitions 
fees from presold mortgages amounted to  in  a increase from the amount of  the amount was a increase from the  recorded in the increases in the past two years have been primarily attributable to two factors a higher level of mortgage loan refinancings caused by the progressively lower interest rate environments  and the decision by the company in late to sell a higher percentage of single family home loan originations into the secondary market as opposed to holding them in the company s loan portfolio 
this strategy was implemented in an effort to shift the company s loan portfolio to having a higher percentage of commercial loans  which are generally shorter term in nature and have higher interest rates 
commissions from sales of insurance and financial products amounted to  in   in  and  in this line item includes commissions the company receives from three sources sales of credit insurance associated with new loans  commissions from the sales of investment  annuity  and long term care insurance products  and commissions from the sale of property and casualty insurance 
the following table presents the contribution of each of the three sources to the total amount recognized in this line item in thousands commissions earned from sales of credit insurance sales of investments  annuities  and long term care insurance sales of property and casualty insurance total the variance in the commissions from sales of credit insurance has been primarily due to fluctuations in the annual profit sharing bonus that the company received from the insurance carriers for which the company acts as a broker 
commissions from sales of investments  annuities  and long term care insurance increased throughout and after its late introduction and decreased slightly in as a result of a lower amount of investment transactions  possibly due to the declining stock market 
commissions from the sale of property and casualty insurance have increased since the may completion of the purchase of two insurance companies that specialize in such insurance 
property and casualty insurance commissions are expected to further increase beginning in the first quarter of as a result of the pending acquisition of uwharrie insurance group  which was completed on january  see the section above entitled merger and acquisition activity for additional discussion 
data processing fees amounted to  in   in  and  in as noted earlier  montgomery data makes its excess data processing capabilities available to area financial institutions for a fee 
these fees have increased as a result of an increase in data processing clients from two clients to four clients in the past three years  as well as an increase in the size and number of transactions generated by those clients 
noninterest income not defined as core amounted to a net gain of  in  a net gain of  in  and a net loss of  in the net gain of  primarily related to miscellaneous securities gains of  the net gain of  primarily relates to a  gain from the sale of two buildings that the company previously operated as branches that were consolidated with other branches in the same towns  and securities that were sold at a  gain 
the net losses of  recorded in primarily related to two merger related events a  loss resulting from a third quarter restructuring of the combined investment portfolio to reduce the company s liability sensitive position and an  gain realized from the fourth quarter sale of a branch that was required to be divested in order to gain regulatory approval 
noninterest expenses noninterest expenses for were  compared to  in and  in table presents the components of the company s noninterest expense during the past three years 
based on the recorded amounts noted above  noninterest expenses increased in and in those growth rates were impacted by two factors  both of which served to reduce the year to year percentage increases 
first  as noted earlier  amortization expense was significantly lower in than in previous years as a result of adopting two new accounting standards in that resulted in the company ceasing to record amortization expense related to nearly all of its intangible assets as of january  second  the company recorded  in merger expenses in the third quarter of these expenses consisted primarily of investment banker fees  attorney fees  employment contract payments  accountant fees  and early termination fees associated with vendor contracts 
adjusting the reported amounts in and to exclude amortization expense related to intangible assets that ceased to be amortized beginning on january  and excluding merger expenses recorded in  the increases in noninterest expenses were in and in over the prior year amounts 
the increases in noninterest expenses over the past two years have occurred in nearly every line item of expense and have been primarily as a result of the significant growth experienced by the company 
over the past two years  the number of the company s branches has increased from to  and the number of full time part time employees has increased from at december  to at december  additionally  from december  to december   the amount of loans outstanding has increased and deposits have increased 
income taxes the provision for income taxes was  in   in  and  in the increase in income tax expense in compared to was a result of a increase in income before income taxes 
the effective tax rate for each of the years ended december  and was approximately 
the increase in income tax expense in compared to was a result of a increase in pretax income  which was partially offset by a lower effective tax rate in compared to in the lower effective tax rate in was due to the effective tax rate being inflated because of the nondeductibility for tax purposes of certain merger expenses 
table presents the components of tax expense and the related effective tax rates 
analysis of financial condition and changes in financial condition overview over the past two years the company has achieved high increases in its levels of loans and deposits 
in  most of the increase was internally generated whereas in  this growth was primarily related to corporate acquisitions 
the following table presents information regarding the nature of the company s growth in and balance at balance at total percentage growth  in thousands beginning internal growth from end of percentage excluding of period growth acquisitions period growth acquisitions loans     deposits noninterest bearing     deposits savings  now  and money market     deposits time     deposits time      total deposits     loans     deposits noninterest bearing     deposits savings  now  and money market     deposits time      deposits time      total deposits     as noted above  in the company s growth was primarily internally generated and loan growth more than doubled deposit growth 
most of the company s internal loan growth occurred in the first half of the year million of the million in total internal growth as the company experienced strong growth in several of the markets it had entered in in the second half of the year  loan growth slowed due to the company having met the initial credit demand in the new markets it had entered  and due to the continued effects of the recessionary economy 
new loan originations throughout the year were partially offset by a large volume of loan customers that refinanced their home loans with the company  which the company subsequently sold into the secondary market instead of maintaining in the company s loan portfolio 
as noted above in the section entitled noninterest income  in late  the company decided to sell a higher percentage of single family home loan originations into the secondary market as opposed to holding them in the company s loan portfolio 
this strategy was implemented in an effort to shift the company s loan portfolio to having a higher percentage of commercial loans  which are generally shorter term in nature and have higher interest rates 
in the first half of  the company s deposit growth continued the low internal growth rates experienced in recent years  with just million in net deposit growth 
however  internal deposit growth increased significantly in the second half of  amounting to million  which the company believes was partially due to investors taking their money out of the chronically declining stock market and depositing it into fdic insured bank deposits 
in  the company s corporate acquisitions were the primary reason for the increases in loans and deposits 
internal loan growth was substantially matched by a similar rate of internal deposit growth 
the rates of internal growth were less than for each 
the company believes the relatively low loan demand and deposit growth in were a result of the recessionary economy and the lower interest rates paid on deposits as a result of the declining interest rate environment 
the higher loan growth experienced in compared to deposit growth resulted in a reduction of the company s liquidity 
the company s liquidity had improved significantly in as a result of receiving million in net cash in connection with the acquisitions 
these funds served as the primary source of funding needs in the company issued million in trust preferred securities in  which qualify as tier i capital 
as a result  the company s capital ratios improved in after declining in as a result of the acquisitions completed during the year 
all three regulatory capital ratios have significantly exceeded the minimum regulatory thresholds for all periods covered by this report 
the company s asset quality ratios generally improved in and remain favorable compared to peers 
in  the company s asset quality ratios declined slightly as a result of the generally recessionary economy that caused an increase in delinquencies and bankruptcies  as well as one large credit that was placed on nonaccrual status in the first quarter of in the years leading up to  the company s market area  the central piedmont region of north carolina  had a healthy economy  with low unemployment and a low business failure rate 
during  the economy in this area  as well as the rest of the nation  slowed 
in the second half of  there were announcements of corporate bankruptcies  layoffs and plant closings in the company s market area 
while the economy in the company s market area remained recessionary in  it did not significantly worsen from  and the company s credit losses remained stable during the year 
the company does not participate in large syndicated credits that have resulted in large credit losses at several other north carolina based banks 
distribution of assets and liabilities table sets forth the percentage relationships of significant components of the company s balance sheets at december    and the most significant variance in the percentages from to is the relative percentage of loans to total assets this amount increased from at december  to at december  the increase in this percentage primarily reflects the high loan growth experienced by the company in of million  which outpaced deposit growth of million 
the funding for this loan growth primarily came from maturities of securities available for sale  which decreased by three percentage points as a percent of total assets during within deposit categories  there was a slight shift from time deposits to demand deposits and savings  now  and money market deposits 
the company believes this may be due to customers deciding that it is advantageous to have their funds in more liquid investments due to the relatively small difference in rates paid on non time deposits compared to the rates paid on time deposits in today s interest rate environment 
the variances in the percentages from to reflect the effects of the company s acquisitions during  as internal growth  as noted above  did not materially impact the company s balance sheet 
the total growth in deposits of million exceeded the million in total loan growth  which resulted in net loans to total assets decreasing from at year end to at year end  and deposits to total assets increasing from to over the same period 
the company assumed million in net cash related to the acquisitions which was not fully reinvested in securities or loans  resulting in the percentage of short term investments to total assets increasing from to 
a slight decrease in the dollar amount of total securities outstanding  coupled with the significant increase in the company s total assets  had the effect of reducing the percentage of total securities to total assets from at december  to at december  securities information regarding the company s securities portfolio as of december    and is presented in tables and the composition of the investment securities portfolio reflects the company s investment strategy of maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity while providing a relatively stable source of income 
the investment portfolio also provides a balance to interest rate risk and credit risk in other categories of the balance sheet while providing a vehicle for the investment of available funds  furnishing liquidity  and supplying securities to pledge as required collateral for certain deposits 
total securities available for sale and held to maturity amounted to million  million  and million at december    and  respectively 
the decrease in securities from december  to december  was primarily attributable to called and maturing bonds  as well as a high level of principal repayments on mortgage backed securities due to the low interest rate environment 
instead of reinvesting the maturities paydowns back into securities  the proceeds were used to fund the high loan growth experienced 
in comparing december  to december   although the total amount of the company s securities did not change materially  upon the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  the company transferred on january   as permitted by the standard upon its adoption  held to maturity securities with an amortized cost of approximately million to the available for sale category at fair value 
from to  the primary variance in the mix of the securities portfolio was a shift from us government agency debt to mortgage backed securities and corporate bonds 
obligations of us government agencies as a percentage of total securities decreased from at december  to at december   while mortgage backed securities increased from at december  to at december  and corporate bonds increased from to of total securities over that same one year period 
during  in an effort to enhance yield  while at the same time managing interest rate exposure  the company invested more heavily in mortgage backed securities and corporate bonds than us government agencies 
in  the change in the mix of securities was primarily due to variances in the receipt of maturities paydowns of the various categories of investments  as the company purchased very few securities as a result of the proceeds of the maturities paydowns being used to fund loan growth 
the majority of the company s us government agency debt securities are issued by the federal home loan bank and carry one maturity date  often with an issuer call feature  while the mortgage backed securities have been primarily issued by freddie mac and fannie mae and vary in their repayment in correlation with the underlying pools of home mortgage loans 
the company s investment in corporate bonds is primarily comprised of trust preferred securities issued by other north carolina bank holding companies 
included in mortgage backed securities at december  were collateralized mortgage obligations cmo s with an amortized cost of  and a fair value of  included in mortgage backed securities at december  were cmo s with an amortized cost of  and a fair value of  included in mortgage backed securities at december  were cmo s with an amortized cost of  and a fair value of  the cmo s that the company has invested in are substantially all early tranche pieces of the cmo  which minimizes the prepayment risk to the company 
at december   net unrealized gains of  were included in the carrying value of securities classified as available for sale  compared to a net unrealized gain of  at december  and a net unrealized gain of  at december  the increase in the unrealized gain position at each of the past two year ends is a result of the progressively lower interest rate environment in effect at each period end 
management evaluated any unrealized losses on individual securities at each year end and determined them to be of a temporary nature and caused by fluctuations in market interest rates  not by concerns about the ability of the issuers to meet their obligations 
net unrealized gains  net of applicable deferred income taxes  of   and  have been reported as part of a separate component of shareholders equity accumulated other comprehensive income as of december    and  respectively 
the fair value of securities held to maturity  which the company carries at amortized cost  was more than the carrying value at december  and by  and  respectively 
management evaluated any unrealized losses on individual securities at each year end and determined them to be of a temporary nature and caused by fluctuations in market interest rates  not by concerns about the ability of the issuers to meet their obligations 
table provides detail as to scheduled contractual maturities and book yields on securities available for sale and securities held to maturity at december  mortgage backed and other amortizing securities are shown maturing in the time periods consistent with their estimated lives based on expected prepayment speeds 
the weighted average taxable equivalent yield for the securities available for sale portfolio was at december  the expected weighted average life of the available for sale portfolio using the call date for above market callable bonds  the maturity date for all other non mortgage backed securities  and the expected life for mortgage backed securities  was years 
the weighted average taxable equivalent yield for the securities held to maturity portfolio was at december  the expected weighted average life of the held to maturity portfolio using the call date for above market callable bonds and the maturity date for all other securities  was years 
as of december  and  the company held no investment securities of any one issuer  other than us treasury and us government agencies or corporations  in which aggregate book values and market values exceeded of shareholders equity 
other than the cmo s previously discussed  the company owned no securities considered by regulatory authorities to be derivative instruments 
loans table provides a summary of the loan portfolio composition at each of the past five year ends 
the loan portfolio is the largest category of the company s earning assets and is comprised of commercial loans  real estate mortgage loans  real estate construction loans  and consumer loans 
the company restricts virtually all of its lending to its county market area  which is located in the central piedmont region of north carolina  and one county in virginia 
the diversity of the region s economic base has historically provided a stable lending environment 
loans outstanding increased million  or  to million during approximately million of the growth was from net internal loan growth  while million was assumed in acquisitions 
in  loans outstanding increased million  or  to million 
approximately million of the growth was from net internal loan growth  while million was assumed in acquisitions 
the most significant acquisition contributing to the loan growth was the may acquisition of century bancorp  which had million in loans outstanding on the date of the acquisition 
the great majority of century s loans were family home loans 
the majority of the and loan growth occurred in loans secured by real estate  with approximately million  or in  and million  or  in of the net loan growth occurring in real estate mortgage or real estate construction loans 
over the years  the company s loan mix has remained fairly consistent  with real estate loans mortgage and construction comprising approximately of the loan portfolio  commercial  financial  and agricultural loans comprising  and consumer installment loans comprising approximately of the portfolio 
at december   million  or  of the company s loan portfolio was secured by liens on real property 
included in this total are million  or of total loans  in loans secured by liens on family residential properties and million  or of total loans  in loans secured by liens on other types of real estate 
the company s million in real estate mortgage loans can be further classified as follows o million  or of total loans  are traditional residential mortgage loans in which the borrower s personal income is the primary repayment source 
o million  or of total loans  are primarily dependent on cash flow from a commercial business for repayment 
o million  or of total loans  are personal consumer installment loans in which the borrower has provided residential real estate as collateral 
o million  or of total loans  are real estate construction loans 
o million  or of total loans  are home equity loans 
o million  or of total loans  are primarily dependent on cash flow from agricultural crop sales 
table provides a summary of scheduled loan maturities over certain time periods  with fixed rate loans and adjustable rate loans shown separately 
approximately of the company s loans outstanding at december  mature within one year and of total loans mature within five years 
the percentages of variable rate loans and fixed rate loans as compared to total performing loans were and  respectively  as of december  the company intentionally makes a blend of fixed and variable rate loans so as to reduce interest rate risk 
nonperforming assets nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans  loans past due or more days and still accruing interest  restructured loans and other real estate 
as a matter of policy the company places all loans that are past due or more days on nonaccrual basis  and thus there were no loans at any of the past five year ends that were days past due and still accruing interest 
table summarizes the company s nonperforming assets at the dates indicated 
nonaccrual loans are loans on which interest income is no longer being recognized or accrued because management has determined that the collection of interest is doubtful 
the placing of loans on nonaccrual status negatively impacts earnings because i interest accrued but unpaid as of the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status is either deducted from interest income or is charged off  ii future accruals of interest income are not recognized until it becomes probable that both principal and interest will be paid and iii principal charged off  if appropriate  may necessitate additional provisions for loan losses that are charged against earnings 
in some cases  where borrowers are experiencing financial difficulties  loans may be restructured to provide terms significantly different from the originally contracted terms 
nonperforming loans which includes nonaccrual loans and restructured loans as of december   and totaled   and  respectively 
nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans amounted to   and  at december    and  respectively 
the variances in nonperforming loans over the past two years have been primarily due to changes in nonaccrual loans  as restructured loans have not changed significantly 
the variances in nonaccrual loans at each of the past two year ends relate primarily to the same loan relationship 
during  the company placed a loan relationship on nonaccrual status that had an outstanding balance of million at december  this relationship  secured primarily by real estate  was placed on nonaccrual status due to liquidity problems experienced by the borrower 
the borrower has been actively working to sell real estate to pay down the balance  and during several sales were completed that resulted in the company receiving paydowns of approximately  at december   the company had accepted a nonbinding proposal from a third party that would result in the receipt of approximately  of the million outstanding in the first half of  with the remaining  to be charged off by the company 
at december   the company had a specific impaired loan valuation allowance of  assigned to this relationship 
also contributing to the increase in nonaccrual loans at december  compared to december  was a general increase in bankruptcies and other financial difficulties experienced among the company s borrowers 
the company attributed this increase to the negative effects of the recessionary economy and manufacturing plant shutdowns in the company s market area 
this led to a total of loans being on nonaccrual status at december  compared to loans at december  during  the number of loans on nonaccrual status remained comparable to the level during  with loans on nonaccrual status at december  if the nonaccrual loans and restructured loans as of december   and had been current in accordance with their original terms and had been outstanding throughout the period or since origination if held for part of the period  gross interest income in the amounts of approximately   and  for nonaccrual loans and   and  for restructured loans would have been recorded for  and  respectively 
interest income on such loans that was actually collected and included in net income in  and amounted to approximately   and  for nonaccrual loans prior to their being placed on nonaccrual status and   and  for restructured loans  respectively 
management routinely monitors the status of certain large loans that  in management s opinion  have credit weaknesses that could cause them to become nonperforming loans 
in addition to the nonperforming loan amounts discussed above  management believes that an estimated million of large loans that were performing in accordance with their contractual terms at december  have the potential to develop problems depending upon the particular financial situations of the borrowers and economic conditions in general 
management has taken these potential problem loans into consideration when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses at december  see discussion below 
loans classified for regulatory purposes as loss  doubtful  substandard  or special mention that have not been disclosed in the problem loan amounts and the potential problem loan amounts discussed above do not represent or result from trends or uncertainties that management reasonably expects will materially impact future operating results  liquidity  or capital resources  or represent material credits about which management is aware of any information that causes management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the loan repayment terms 
other real estate includes foreclosed  repossessed  and idled properties 
other real estate has not varied materially at any of the past three year ends  amounting to  at december    at december   and  at december  other real estate represented   and of total assets at the end of   and  respectively 
the company s management believes that the fair values of the items of other real estate  less estimated costs to sell  equal or exceed their respective carrying values at the dates presented 
allowance for loan losses and loan loss experience the allowance for loan losses is created by direct charges to operations 
losses on loans are charged against the allowance in the period in which such loans  in management s opinion  become uncollectible 
the recoveries realized during the period are credited to this allowance 
the company considers its procedures for recording the amount of the allowance for loan losses and the related provision for loan losses to be a critical accounting policy 
see the heading critical accounting policies above for further discussion 
the factors that influence management s judgment in determining the amount charged to operating expense include past loan loss experience  composition of the loan portfolio  evaluation of probable inherent losses and current economic conditions 
the company uses a loan analysis and grading program to facilitate its evaluation of probable inherent loan losses and the adequacy of its allowance for loan losses 
in this program  risk grades are assigned by management and tested by the company s internal audit department and an independent third party consulting firm 
the testing program includes an evaluation of a sample of new loans  loans that management identifies as having potential credit weaknesses  loans past due days or more  nonaccrual loans and any other loans identified during previous regulatory and other examinations 
the company strives to maintain its loan portfolio in accordance with what management believes are conservative loan underwriting policies that result in loans specifically tailored to the needs of the company s market areas 
every effort is made to identify and minimize the credit risks associated with such lending strategies 
the company has no foreign loans  few agricultural loans and does not engage in significant lease financing or highly leveraged transactions 
commercial loans are diversified among a variety of industries 
the majority of loans captioned in the tables discussed below as real estate loans are primarily various personal and commercial loans where real estate provides additional security for the loan 
collateral for virtually all of these loans is located within the company s principal market area 
the allowance for loan losses amounted to  at december  compared to  as of december  and  at december  this represented   and  of loans outstanding as of december    and  respectively 
the four basis point increase in this percentage is primarily a result of a slight shift in the composition of the company s loan portfolio from residential mortgage loans to commercial loans commercial loans carry a higher reserve percentage in the company s allowance for loan loss model than do residential mortgage loans 
the slight shift from residential mortgage loans to commercial loans has been intentional 
two of the company s recent bank acquisitions first savings bancorp in september and century bancorp in may had loan portfolios that were highly concentrated in residential mortgage loans 
as many of those loans have refinanced at lower rates over the past months  the company chose to sell them in the secondary market instead of holding them in the company s loan portfolio 
this strategy was implemented in an effort to shift the company s loan portfolio to having a higher percentage of commercial loans  which are generally shorter term in nature and have higher interest rates 
as noted in table  the company s allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans coverage ratio amounted to at december   compared to at december  and at december  the change in the coverage ratio is inversely proportional to the level of nonperforming loans at each period end 
due to the secured nature of virtually all of the company s loans that are on nonaccrual status  the variance in the coverage ratio is not necessarily indicative of the relative adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
table sets forth the allocation of the allowance for loan losses at the dates indicated 
the portion of these reserves that was allocated to specific loan types in the loan portfolio increased to  at december  from  at december  and  at december  the increase in the amount of the allocated allowance during is consistent with the increase in total loans outstanding 
similarly  the increase in the allocated reserve when comparing december  to december  is consistent with the increase in loans outstanding experienced in the slightly higher increase in the allocated allowance compared to the increase in loan growth for each of the past two years relates to the company s loan mix shifting slightly from residential real estate loans to commercial real estate loans which carry a higher reserve allocation in the company s allowance model as discussed two paragraphs above 
in addition to the allocated portion of the allowance for loan losses  the company maintains an unallocated portion that is not assigned to any specific category of loans  but rather is intended to reserve for the inherent risk in the overall portfolio and the intrinsic inaccuracies associated with the estimation of the allowance for loan losses and its allocation to specific loan categories 
the amount of the unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses did not vary materially at any of the past three year ends  while the decrease in the unallocated allowance from to was related to the company segregating and assigning higher reserve percentages to particular loan types that were identified during as having inherently higher risk this resulted in a portion of the allowance for loan losses shifting from unallocated to allocated 
these additional risk characteristics were noted by management as a part of its ongoing analysis and review of its loan portfolio and historical charge off experience  and did not result from any deterioration of the portfolio during management considers the allowance for loan losses adequate to cover probable loan losses on the loans outstanding as of each reporting date 
it must by emphasized  however  that the determination of the allowance using the company s procedures and methods rests upon various judgments and assumptions about economic conditions and other factors affecting loans 
no assurance can be given that the company will not in any particular period sustain loan losses that are sizable in relation to the amount reserved or that subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio  in light of conditions and factors then prevailing  will not require significant changes in the allowance for loan losses or future charges to earnings 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the allowances for loan losses and losses on foreclosed real estate 
such agencies may require the company to recognize additions to the allowances based on the examiners judgments about information available to them at the time of their examinations 
for the years indicated  table summarizes the company s balances of loans outstanding  average loans outstanding  and a detailed rollforward of the allowance for loan losses 
in addition to the increases to the allowance for loan losses related to normal provisions  the increases in the dollar amounts of the allowance for loan losses in and were also affected by amounts recorded to provide for loans assumed in corporate acquisitions 
in   was provided for loans assumed in the broadway branch acquisition in which the company assumed approximately million in loans 
in  the company recorded  to the allowance for loan losses related to loans assumed in two corporate acquisitions 
approximately  of the  related to million in mostly consumer loans assumed in the march and december branch acquisitions  while  related to the century acquisition 
the  addition related to century represented the book value of century s allowance for loan losses on the date of the acquisition 
the company s net loan charge offs were approximately  in   in  and  in this represents   and of average loans during   and respectively 
a rise in consumer bankruptcy filings is primarily responsible for the increase in net charge offs in  while the increase in is primarily related to several commercial loans that were secured by equipment and inventory 
deposits the average amounts of deposits of the company and the average yield paid for those deposits for the years ended december   and are presented in table average deposits grew to billion in  an increase of million  or 
in  the company s average deposits experienced growth of million  or 
approximately half of the increase in average deposits in and a large majority of the average deposit growth relate to corporate acquisitions completed in  which increased deposits outstanding a total of million over the course of the year 
the effect of having the acquired deposits for all months in coupled with the increase in the year end balance at december  compared to december  resulted in the increase in average deposits for the year 
the increase in average deposits in was primarily driven by increases in the non time deposit categories 
during  average noninterest bearing demand deposits increased  interest bearing demand deposits increased  and savings deposits increased 
average time deposits and time deposits greater than  increased at lower rates of and respectively 
the higher increases in non time deposits were primarily a result of the mix of the company s deposit acquisitions and the mix of the company s deposit growth 
the company s acquisitions were comprised of a high mix of non time deposits  while in the company noted that many customers deposited their maturing time deposits into other categories of deposits rather than renew their time deposits at the historically low rates in effect 
the growth in average deposits occurred in all types of deposits  with each category experiencing an increase of at least 
the increases in the average amounts of non time deposits which include noninterest bearing deposits  interest bearing demand deposits  and savings deposits were primarily due to the march acquisition of the four first union branches  the deposits of which were comprised of a high percentage of non time deposits of those branches total deposits 
the increases in time deposits less than  and time deposits greater than  were primarily due to the first union time deposits  as well as the time deposits million assumed in the may century acquisition 
internal growth during of approximately for noninterest bearing deposits  interest bearing demand deposits and savings deposits contributed to the deposit growth in non time deposits 
internal growth in time deposits greater than  of contributed to the growth in this category  while a net decrease in internally generated time deposits less than  of partially negated the overall increase in this category 
as of december   the company held approximately million in time deposits of  or more and other time deposits of million 
table is a maturity schedule of time deposits of  or more as of december  this table shows that of the company s time deposits greater than  mature within one year 
the company does not issue any time deposits through foreign offices  nor does the company believe that it holds any deposits by foreign depositors 
borrowings at december   the company had three sources of readily available borrowing capacity an approximately  line of credit with the federal home loan bank fhlb  of which million was outstanding  a  overnight federal funds line of credit with a correspondent bank  and an approximately  line of credit through the federal reserve bank of richmond s frb discount window 
the company s line of credit with the fhlb totaling approximately  can be structured as either short term or long term borrowings  depending on the particular funding or liquidity need  and is secured by the company s fhlb stock and a blanket lien on its one to four family residential loan portfolio 
at december   the company had million in outstanding borrowings under this line of credit  with million at a fixed rate of due in may and million at a fixed rate of due in april  with a call date by the fhlb in april the company also has a correspondent bank relationship established that allows the company to purchase up to  in federal funds on an overnight  unsecured basis 
the company had no borrowings outstanding under this line at december  or this line of credit was not drawn upon in or there was insignificant use of this line during  with total interest expense incurred amounting to approximately  the company also has a line of credit with the frb discount window 
this line is secured by a blanket lien on a portion of the company s commercial  consumer and real estate portfolio excluding family residences 
based on the collateral owned by the company as of december   the available line of credit is approximately  this line of credit was established primarily in connection with the company s yk liquidity contingency plan and has not been drawn on since inception 
the frb has indicated that it would not expect lines of credit that have been granted to financial institutions to be a primary borrowing source 
the company plans to maintain this line of credit  although it is not expected that it will be drawn upon except in unusual circumstances 
in addition to the lines of credit described above in which the company has million outstanding  the company issued million in borrowings on october  these borrowings are due on november  and were structured as trust preferred capital securities that qualify as tier i capital for regulatory capital adequacy requirements 
these debt securities are callable by the company at par on any quarterly interest payment date beginning on november  the interest rate on these debt securities adjusts on a quarterly basis at a rate of three month libor plus 
this rate may not exceed through november average short term borrowings for each of the past five years were less than thirty percent of total shareholders equity at all times during each period 
liquidity the company s liquidity is determined by its ability to convert assets to cash or acquire alternative sources of funds to meet the needs of its customers who are withdrawing or borrowing funds  and to maintain required reserve levels  pay expenses and operate the company on an ongoing basis 
the company s primary liquidity sources are net income from operations  cash and due from banks  federal funds sold and other short term investments 
the company s securities portfolio is comprised almost entirely of readily marketable securities which could also be sold to provide cash 
as noted above  in addition to internally generated liquidity sources  the company has the ability to obtain borrowings from the following three sources an approximately million line of credit with the fhlb  a million overnight federal funds line of credit with a correspondent bank  and an approximately million line of credit through the federal reserve bank of richmond s frb discount window 
the company s on balance sheet liquidity declined in as a result of the strong loan growth million that outpaced deposit growth million during the year 
the imbalance in the loan growth compared to the deposit growth in increased the loan to deposit ratio from at december  to at december  additionally  the percentage of balance sheet assets that are generally regarded as being liquid consisting of cash  due from banks  federal funds sold  presold mortgages in process of settlement and securities decreased from of total deposits and borrowings at december  to at december  in  liquidity indicators increased as a result of the corporate acquisitions completed during the year 
in connection with the acquisitions  the company received a net of million in cash and securities  million in loans  and million in deposits 
as a result  the company s loan to deposit ratio decreased from at december  to at december  additionally  the percentage of liquid balance sheet assets increased from of total deposits and borrowings at december  to at december in the normal course of business there are various outstanding contractual obligations of the company that will require future cash outflows 
in addition  there are commitments and contingent liabilities  such as commitments to extend credit  that may or may not require future cash outflows 
table reflects the contractual obligations and other commercial commitments of the company outstanding as of december  of the million in long term debt maturing in more than five years  million relates to fhlb debt that has a call option whereby the fhlb may call the debt in also  any outstanding borrowings with the fhlb may be accelerated immediately by the fhlb in certain circumstances  including material adverse changes in the condition of the company or if the company s qualifying collateral amounts to less than times the amount of borrowings outstanding 
at december   the company s qualifying collateral amounted to times the amount of borrowings outstanding 
in the normal course of business there are various outstanding commitments and contingent liabilities  such as commitments to extend credit  which are not reflected in the financial statements 
table also reflects other commercial commitments of the company outstanding as of december  this table reflects that as of december   the company had outstanding loan commitments of  the sum of credit cards and lines of credit and loan commitments line items  of which  were at variable rates and  were at fixed rates 
included in outstanding loan commitments were unfunded commitments of  on revolving credit plans  of which  were at variable rates and  were at fixed rates 
in addition to the credit card and other loan commitments described above  at december   the company had  in standby letters of credit outstanding 
the company has no carrying amount for these standby letters of credit 
the nature of the standby letters of credit is a guarantee made on behalf the company s customers to suppliers of the customers to guarantee payments owed to the supplier by the customer 
the standby letters of credit have two to three year terms  and the payment of the guarantees would generally be triggered by a continued nonpayment of an obligation owed by the customer to the supplier 
the maximum potential amount of future payments undiscounted the company could be required to make under the guarantees in the event of nonperformance by the parties to whom credit or financial guarantees have been extended is represented by the contractual amount of the financial instruments discussed above 
in the event that the company is required to honor a standby letter of credit  a note  already executed with the customer  is triggered which provides repayment terms and any collateral 
over the past ten years  the company has had to honor one standby letter of credit  which was repaid by the borrower without any loss to the company 
it has been the experience of the company that deposit withdrawals are generally replaced with new deposits  thus not requiring any net cash outflow 
based on that assumption  management believes that it can meet its contractual cash obligations and existing commitments from normal operations 
the company is not involved in any legal proceedings that  in management s opinion  could have a material effect on the consolidated financial position of the company 
off balance sheet derivative financial instruments include futures  forwards  interest rate swaps  options contracts  and other financial instruments with similar characteristics 
the company does not engage in off balance sheet derivatives activities 
despite the decline in on balance sheet liquidity levels in discussed above  the company s management believes its liquidity sources  including unused lines of credit  are at an acceptable level and remain adequate to meet its operating needs in the foreseeable future 
the company will continue to monitor its liquidity position carefully and will explore and implement strategies to increase liquidity if deemed appropriate 
interest rate risk including quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk item a 
net interest income is the company s most significant component of earnings 
notwithstanding changes in volumes of loans and deposits  the company s level of net interest income is continually at risk due to the effect that changes in general market interest rate trends have on interest yields earned and paid with respect to the various categories of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
it is the company s policy to maintain portfolios of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities with maturities and repricing opportunities that will afford protection  to the extent practical  against wide interest rate fluctuations 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk is analyzed on a regular basis by management using standard gap reports  maturity reports  and an asset liability software model that simulates future levels of interest income and expense based on current interest rates  expected future interest rates  and various intervals of shock interest rates 
over the years  the company has been able to maintain a fairly consistent yield on average earning assets net interest margin 
over the past five calendar years the company s net interest margin has ranged from a low of realized in to a high of realized in 
during that five year period the prime rate of interest has ranged from a low of to a high of 
in  the company experienced downward pressure on its net interest margin  primarily as a result of the significant decreases in the interest rate environment the company s interest earning assets adjusted downwards quicker and by a greater amount than did the company s interest bearing liabilities 
in the first quarter of  the company s net interest margin was the highest it had been since the fourth quarter of  primarily as a result of the stable interest rate environment  when for the first time in five quarters  there were no decreases in rates initiated by the federal reserve 
this allowed a significant portion of the company s time deposits that were originated during periods of higher interest rates and matured during the quarter to reprice at lower levels  whereas the company s rate sensitive interest earning assets had repriced lower immediately upon the rate cuts by the federal reserve in  and thus did not experience further rate reductions 
there were also no changes in rates in the second or third quarters of  which allowed the company s time deposits to continue to mature and reprice at lower levels 
as a result  the company s net interest margin for the third quarter of was  its highest level since the company s merger with first savings bancorp in consistent with what occurred in  the basis point rate cut initiated by the federal reserve on november  negatively impacted the company s net interest margin as interest sensitive assets repriced downwards sooner and by a greater amount than did the company s interest sensitive liabilities 
the company s net interest margin for the fourth quarter of was  a basis point decrease from the third quarter of assuming rates remain unchanged in  the company expects the net interest margin to rebound as the company s time deposits reprice at lower rates upon their maturity 
competitive pressures in the marketplace could limit or eliminate the expected increase in the net interest margin 
table sets forth the company s interest rate sensitivity analysis as of december   using stated maturities for all instruments except mortgage backed securities which are allocated in the periods of their expected payback and securities and borrowings with call features that are expected to be called which are shown in the period of their expected call 
as illustrated by this table  the company had million more in interest bearing liabilities that are subject to interest rate changes within one year than earning assets 
this generally would indicate that net interest income would experience downward pressure in a rising interest rate environment and would benefit from a declining interest rate environment 
however  this method of analyzing interest sensitivity only measures the magnitude of the timing differences and does not address earnings  market value  or management actions 
also  interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
in addition to the effects of when various rate sensitive products reprice  market rate changes may not result in uniform changes in rates among all products 
for example  included in interest bearing liabilities at december  subject to interest rate changes within one year are deposits totaling million comprised of now  savings  and certain types of money market deposits with interest rates set by management 
these types of deposits historically have not repriced coincidentally with or in the same proportion as general market indicators 
thus  the company believes that in the near term twelve months  net interest income would not likely experience significant downward pressure from rising interest rates 
similarly  management would not expect a significant increase in near term net interest income from falling interest rates in fact  as discussed above under the heading components of earnings  a declining interest rate environment during negatively impacted at least temporarily the company s net interest margin 
generally  when rates change  the company s interest sensitive assets that are subject to adjustment reprice immediately and in an amount that is close to the full amount of the change  while the company s interest sensitive liabilities that are subject to adjustment reprice at a lag to the rate change and typically not to the full extent of the rate change 
the net effect is that in the twelve month horizon  as rates change  the impact of having a higher level of interest sensitive liabilities is substantially negated by the later and lower amount of change these liabilities experience compared to interest sensitive assets 
the company has no market risk sensitive instruments held for trading purposes  nor does it maintain any foreign currency positions 
table presents the expected maturities of the company s other than trading market risk sensitive financial instruments 
table also presents the estimated fair values of market risk sensitive instruments as estimated in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about fair value of financial instruments 
the company s assets and liabilities each have estimated fair values that are slightly higher than their carrying value 
this is due to the yields on these portfolios being higher than market yields at december  for instruments with maturities similar to the remaining term of the portfolios  due to the declining interest rate environment 
see additional discussion regarding net interest income  as well as discussion of the changes in the annual net interest margin in the section entitled net interest income above 
return on assets and equity table shows return on assets net income divided by average total assets  return on equity net income divided by average shareholders equity  dividend payout ratio dividends per share divided by net income per share and shareholders equity to assets ratio average shareholders equity divided by average total assets for each of the years in the three year period ended december  return on assets  return on equity  and dividend payout ratio per basic share for the year were significantly impacted by the nonrecurring merger related charges discussed previously 
capital resources and shareholders equity shareholders equity at december  amounted to million compared to million at december  the two basic components typically affecting the company s shareholders equity are net income  which increases shareholders equity  and dividends declared  which decreases shareholders equity 
in  net income of  increased equity  while dividends declared of  reduced equity 
in addition to the two basic components affecting shareholders equity  during the past three years shareholders equity has also been significantly impacted by repurchases of the company s common stock 
in connection with the october announcement that a definitive merger agreement had been executed with century bancorp in a part cash part stock transaction  the company announced its intent to repurchase  beginning immediately  up to the  shares that would be issued to complete the acquisition 
subsequent to the date of the announcement and through december   the company repurchased approximately  shares at an average cost of  shares had been repurchased early in at an average price of 
in  the company repurchased another  shares of common stock at an average repurchase price of per share 
after completing the repurchase of the  shares in the first quarter of  the company continued to repurchase stock under additional authorizations granted by the company s board of directors 
the extensions of the share repurchase authorizations have been intended to provide the company flexibility in managing its capital and enhance shareholder value 
in total  during the year ended december   the company repurchased  shares of stock at an average price of per share 
at december   the company had a remaining authorization to repurchase  shares of stock 
other items affecting shareholders equity in were proceeds of  received from common stock issued as a result of stock option exercises  proceeds of  received from the issuance of stock into the company s dividend reinvestment plan  a  increase to equity related to the tax benefit that the company realized due to exercises of nonqualified stock options  and other comprehensive income of  which was comprised of the  increase in the net unrealized gain  net of taxes  of the company s available for sale securities that was reduced by an adjustment to the company s pension liability of  net of taxes 
in  one other item had a significant effect on shareholders equity common stock issued in acquisitions  which primarily related to the company s may acquisition of century in which approximately  shares of common stock were issued 
the issuance of stock in connection with the company s acquisitions increased shareholders equity by million in other items affecting shareholders equity in were proceeds of  received from common stock issued as a result of stock option exercises  proceeds of  received from the issuance of stock into the company s dividend reinvestment plan  and other comprehensive income  which was comprised entirely of the change in the unrealized gain or loss  net of taxes  of the company s available for sale securities and amounted to  in in  in addition to net income and dividends  there were two other items that had a significant effect on shareholders equity other comprehensive income related to the company s available for sale securities of  and repurchases and retirement of  shares of common stock amounting to  in addition to the items noted above that affected shareholders equity in  the company received proceeds of  in connection with the issuance of  shares related to exercises of stock options  issued  shares and received  in proceeds from issuances of stock into the company s dividend reinvestment plan  and recorded a  increase to equity related to the tax benefit that the company realized due to exercises of nonqualified stock options

table presents the company s regulatory capital ratios as of december    and in  while at all times the company s regulatory capital ratios far exceeded regulatory minimums  the ratios decreased significantly as a result of the company s acquisitions  which increased assets and decreased tangible capital 
in  as a result of the company forecasting that its strategic growth goals would likely result in the need for additional capital  the company issued million in debt structured as trust preferred capital securities that qualify as tier i capital for regulatory capital adequacy requirements see borrowings above for further discussion 
as a result of the issuance of the trust preferred securities  the company s capital ratios increased significantly at december  compared to december  in addition to the minimum capital requirements described above  the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action also contains specific capital guidelines for a bank s classification as well capitalized 
the specific guidelines are as follows tier i capital ratio of at least  total capital ratio of at least  and a leverage ratio of at least 
the bank s regulatory ratios exceeded the threshold for well capitalized status at december   and see supervision and regulation under business above and note to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of other matters that may affect the company s capital resources 
inflation since the assets and liabilities of a bank are primarily monetary in nature payable in fixed determinable amounts  the performance of a bank is affected more by changes in interest rates than by inflation 
interest rates generally increase as the rate of inflation increases  but the magnitude of the change in rates may not be the same 
the effect of inflation on banks is normally not as significant as its influence on those businesses that have large investments in plant and inventories 
during periods of high inflation  there are normally corresponding increases in the money supply  and banks will normally experience above average growth in assets  loans and deposits 
also  general increases in the price of goods and services will result in increased operating expenses
