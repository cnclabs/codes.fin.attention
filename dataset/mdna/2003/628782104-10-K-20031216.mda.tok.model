critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the most significant estimates include revenue recognition and estimating allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation and obsolescence  valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill including the values assigned to acquired intangible assets  income tax valuation allowance  foreign currency  and estimating accruals for  and probability of  the outcome of current litigation 
the company continually evaluates its accounting policies and the estimates it uses to prepare the consolidated financial statements 
in general  the estimates are based on historical experience  on information from third party professionals and on various other sources and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances at the time such estimates are made 
management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made  and changes in the estimate  or the use of different estimating methods  could have a material impact on the company s consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements  which are included in item in this form k filing 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
certain of the company s accounting policies are deemed critical  as they require management s highest degree of judgment  estimates and assumptions 
the following critical accounting policies are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of the company s accounting policies or estimates 
revenue recognition the company applies the provisions of staff accounting bulletin revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue from products shipped when title and risk of loss has passed to its customers  and with respect to its own retail store operations  upon the sale of its products 
the company s net sales represent gross sales invoiced to customers  less certain related charges  including discounts  returns  rebates and other allowances 
most of the company s sales require judgments principally in the areas of returns  rebates and other allowances 
the provision for estimated sales returns and other allowances and deferrals require significant judgment whereby the company must estimate  based on historical trends and individual agreements with customers  the reduction of revenue at the time of revenue recognition 
if these estimates  which are based on historical experience  are significantly below the actual amounts  revenue could be adversely affected 
the company has no single customer that represents more than ten percent of annual net sales of the company for the fiscal years ended september   and for the fiscal years ended  and  one customer  two customers and one customer  respectively  represented  individually  more than of the wholesale division net sales 
accounts receivable the company performs on going credit evaluations of its customers and adjusts credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by the review of their current credit information 
collections and payments from customers are continuously monitored 
the company also maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts  which is estimated based upon historical experience as well as specific customer collection issues that have been identified 
while such bad debt expenses have historically been within expectations and allowances established  the company cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that it has in the past 
one customer accounted for and of the company s accounts receivable at september  and  respectively 
additionally  a new customer accounted for of the company s accounts receivable at september  the loss of either or both of these customers is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
the cost elements of inventory include materials  labor and overhead 
the company regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on estimated forecasts of product demand and production requirements for the next twelve months 
in assessing the realization of inventories  the company is required to make judgments as to future demand requirements and compare that with inventory levels 
it is possible that changes in consumer demand could cause a reduction in the net realizable value of inventory 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
these evaluations require the use of judgment as to the effects of external factors and market conditions on the company s conduct of its operations  and they require the use of estimates in projecting future operating results 
if actual external conditions or future operating results differ from the company s judgments  impairment charges may be necessary to reduce the carrying value of the subject assets 
pursuant to sfas no 
 the company performs an annual goodwill impairment review for each business segment  as defined in note  goodwill and intangible assets to the consolidated financial statements  or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the company considers the following to be some examples of important indicators that may trigger an impairment review i significant under performance or loss of key contracts acquired in an acquisition relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  ii significant changes in the manner or use of the acquired assets or in the company s overall strategy with respect to the manner or use of the acquired assets or changes in the company s overall business strategy  iii significant negative industry or economic trends  iv increased competitive pressures  v a significant decline in the company s stock price for a sustained period of time  and vi regulatory changes 
in assessing the recoverability of the company s goodwill and intangibles  the company must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
the fair value of an asset could vary  depending upon the estimating method employed  as well as assumptions made 
this may result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and or goodwill  or alternatively an acceleration in amortization expense 
an impairment charge would reduce operating income in the period it was determined that the charge was needed 
as a result of the september  impairment testing  no impairment adjustments were deemed necessary 
purchase price allocation during fiscal  the company acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of rexall for  in cash subject to adjustment based upon finalization of working capital balances on the closing date 
prior to this acquisition  rexall was owned by numico usa  inc  an indirect subsidiary of royal numico nv this acquisition was accomplished through purchase by the company of certain partnership and limited liability company interests 
the company also incurred approximately  of direct transaction costs as well as approximately  in insurance and other indirect costs for a total purchase price of approximately  additionally  finance related costs of approximately  were paid to secure the financing for this acquisition  which costs will be amortized until its approximate year maturity 
the total purchase price was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value was recorded as goodwill 
the fair value assigned to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed was based upon estimates and assumptions developed by management and other information compiled by management  including a valuation  prepared by an independent valuation specialist that utilized established valuation techniques appropriate for the industry 
upon completion of the valuation of the fair value of the net assets acquired which the company expects to finalize by end of fiscal  actual results may differ from those presented herein 
impairment of long lived assets the company follows the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement requires that certain assets be reviewed for impairment and  if impaired  remeasured at fair value whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
impairment loss estimates are primarily based upon management s analysis and review of the carrying value of long lived assets at each balance sheet date  utilizing an undiscounted future cash flow calculation 
during fiscal years  and  the company recognized impairment losses of  and  respectively  on assets to be held and used 
the impairment losses related primarily to leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures for us retail operations and were recorded in selling  general and administrative expense 
income taxes the company estimates the degree to which tax assets and loss carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction 
a valuation allowance for such tax assets and loss carryforwards is provided when it is determined that such assets will more likely than not go unused 
if it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset or loss carryforward will be used  the related valuation allowance on such assets is reversed 
if actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction varies from estimates  additional allowances or reversals of reserves may be necessary 
foreign currency foreign subsidiaries account for approximately of net revenues  of assets and of total liabilities of the company as of september in preparing the consolidated financial statements  the financial statements of the foreign subsidiaries are translated from the currency in which they keep their accounting records  generally the local currency  into us dollars 
this process results in exchange gains and losses  which  under the relevant accounting guidance  are either included within the statement of operations or as a separate component of stockholders equity under the caption accumulated other comprehensive income 
under the relevant accounting guidance  the treatment of these translation gains or losses is dependent upon management s determination of the functional currency of each subsidiary 
the functional currency is determined based on management s judgment and involves consideration of all relevant economic facts and circumstances affecting the subsidiary 
generally  the currency in which the subsidiary transacts a majority of its transactions  including billings  financing  payroll and other expenditures would be considered the functional currency but any dependency upon the parent and the nature of the subsidiary s operations must also be considered 
if a subsidiary s functional currency is deemed to be the local currency  then any gain or loss associated with the translation of that subsidiary s financial statements is included in accumulated other comprehensive income 
however  if the functional currency is deemed to be the us dollar  then any gain or loss associated with the translation of these financial statements would be included within the statement of operations 
if the company disposes of subsidiaries  then any cumulative translation gains or losses would be recorded into the statement of operations 
if the company determines that there has been a change in the functional currency of a subsidiary to the us dollar  any translation gains or losses arising after the date of change would be included within the statement of operations 
based on an assessment of the factors discussed above  the company considers the relevant subsidiary s local currency to be the functional currency for each of its foreign subsidiaries 
during fiscal years  and  translation gains losses of   and  respectively  were included under accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
accordingly  cumulative translation gains of approximately  and  were included as part of accumulated other comprehensive income within the balance sheet at september  and september   respectively 
had the company determined that the functional currency of its subsidiaries was the us dollar  these gains losses would have increased reduced net income for each of the periods presented 
the magnitude of these gains or losses is dependent upon movements in the exchange rates of the foreign currencies against the us dollar 
these currencies include the euro and the british pound 
any future translation gains or losses could be significantly higher than those noted in each of these years 
in addition  if a change in the functional currency of a foreign subsidiary has occurred at any point in time  the company would be required to include any translation gains or losses from the date of such change in the statement of operations 
contingencies as discussed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  nbty is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liabilities that may result from the final resolution of certain contingencies disclosed 
assessments of each potential liability will be made as additional information becomes available

in may  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue  determining whether an arrangement is a lease  which provides guidance on identifying leases that may be embedded in contracts or other arrangements that sell or purchase products or services 
the evaluation of whether an arrangement contains a lease within the scope of sfas no 
 accounting for leases  should be based on an evaluation of whether the arrangement conveys the right to use and control specific property or equipment 
the consensus requires sellers to report revenues from the leasing component of these arrangements as leasing or rental income rather than revenues from product sales or services  and requires purchasers to report the costs from these arrangements as costs under capital leases 
this could affect the timing and amount of recognition of revenues and expenses and the classification of assets and liabilities on the balance sheet  and it could require additional footnote disclosure of lease terms and future minimum lease commitments 
this consensus is effective for contracts entered into or significantly modified after july  the company does not have relationships with customers that meet the eitf definition of a lease arrangement
