item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations greenbrier currently operates in two primary business segments manufacturing and leasing services 
the two business segments are operationally integrated 
from operations in north america  the manufacturing segment produces double stack intermodal railcars  conventional railcars  marine vessels and forged steel products and performs railcar repair  refurbishment and maintenance activities 
the company may also manufacture new freight cars through the use of unaffiliated subcontractors 
the leasing services segment owns  railcars and provides management services for approximately  railcars for railroads  shippers  carriers and other leasing and transportation companies 
in august  the company s board of directors committed to a plan to recapitalize operations in europe  which consist of a railcar manufacturing plant in poland and a railcar sales  design and engineering operation in germany 
accordingly  the company has classified its european operations as discontinued operations in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the assets  liabilities  operating results and cash flows related to the discontinued operations are presented as a single line item in the consolidated balance sheets  statements of operations and statements of cash flows 
railcars are generally manufactured  repaired  or refurbished under firm orders from third parties  and revenue is recognized when the cars are completed  accepted by the customer  and contractual contingencies removed 
greenbrier may also manufacture railcars prior to receipt of firm orders and build railcars for its own lease fleet 
railcars produced in a given period may be delivered in subsequent periods  delaying revenue recognition 
revenue does not include sales of new railcars to  or refurbishment services performed for  the leasing services segment since intercompany transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements 
the margin generated from such sales or refurbishment activity is realized by the leasing services segment over the related life of the asset or upon sale of the equipment to a third party 
overview total revenue from continuing operations was million  million and million for the years ended august   and earnings from continuing operations for were million  or per diluted common share  while the loss from continuing operations was million  or per diluted common share and earnings from continuing operations were million  or per diluted common share 
results from discontinued operations were near breakeven for the year ended august  for the years ended august  and  losses from discontinued operations were million and million 
results of continuing operations the discussion of results of continuing operations excludes the results of european operations for all periods presented 
manufacturing segment manufacturing revenue includes new railcar  marine  forge  refurbishment and maintenance activities 
new railcar delivery and backlog information disclosed herein includes all north american facilities  including the mexico joint venture that is accounted for by the equity method 
manufacturing revenue was million  million and million for the years ended  and manufacturing revenue increased million  or  in from due to increased deliveries in response to improvements in the industry demand for railcars  slightly offset by a product mix with a lower unit sales value 
manufacturing revenue decreased million  or  in from due to fewer deliveries resulting from a cyclical downturn in the north american railcar market and competitive pressure on prices 
deliveries of new railcars  which are the primary source of revenue  were approximately  in   in  and  in deliveries for exclude units that have been delivered to and paid for by a customer for which revenue has been deferred pending removal of contractual contingencies 

table of contents as of august   the backlog of new railcars to be manufactured for sale and lease at north american facilities was approximately  railcars with an estimated value of million 
backlog has increased significantly over the year as the railcar market began to recover 
backlog as of august  was  railcars with a value of million 
manufacturing margin increased to in from in due to efficiencies associated with higher production rates and the impact of a favorable shift in product mix  offset somewhat by costs related to production that was delayed due to an injunction associated with a patent litigation lawsuit 
results for were impacted by the closure of one plant for five months of the year 
the effects of increased competition on selling prices  inefficiencies associated with slower production rates and the overhead associated with a plant that was temporarily shut down for five months of the year were the cause of the decline from in to in the factors influencing cost of revenue and gross margin in a given period include order size which affects economies of plant utilization  production rates  product mix  changes in manufacturing costs  product pricing and currency exchange rates 
leasing services segment leasing services revenue was million  million and million for the years ended  and the decrease in leasing services revenue is due to a number of factors including maturation of the direct finance lease portfolio  increased pressure on lease renewal rates and a reduction of gains on sale of equipment from the lease fleet  offset partially by reductions of accruals for rental assistance guarantees and increased utilization of the car hire lease fleet 
a substantial portion of the owned equipment in the lease fleet was acquired through an agreement entered into in august with southern pacific transportation company  which has since merged with union pacific  to purchase and refurbish approximately  railcars between and the railcars were refurbished by greenbrier or unaffiliated contract shops and placed on predominantly year finance leases with union pacific  which contain a fixed price purchase option exercisable upon lease expiration 
union pacific has exercised the purchase option on approximately  railcars through august  and has notified greenbrier of their intention to exercise this option on all remaining railcars in this program 
as these leases mature over the next five years  related leasing revenue will continue to decline 
revenue may be replaced by growth of the lease fleet and management services 
a portion of leasing services revenue is derived from car hire which is a fee that a railroad pays for the use of railcars owned by other railroads or third parties 
car hire earned by a railcar is usually made up of hourly and mileage components 
until  the interstate commerce commission directly regulated car hire rates by prescribing a formula for calculating these rates 
government regulation of car hire rates continues but the system of prescribed rates has been superseded by a system known as deprescription 
january  ended a ten year period used to phase in this new system 
deprescription is a system whereby railcar owners and users have the right to negotiate car hire rates 
if the railcar owner and railcar user cannot come to an agreement on a car hire rate  then either party has the right to call for arbitration 
in arbitration either the owner s or user s rate is selected and that rate becomes effective for a one year period 
substantially all railcars in the greenbrier fleet are subject to deprescription 
there is some risk that car hire rates could be negotiated or arbitrated to lower levels in the future 
this could reduce future car hire revenue 
greenbrier earned car hire revenue of million  million and million in  and leasing services margin  as a percentage of revenue  was in consistent with margins 
margin was in margins have declined from  as a result of the maturation of the direct finance lease portfolio and competitive and economic pressure on lease renewal rates  offset by changes in product mix as direct finance leases are replaced with operating leases and maintenance and management services 
pre tax earnings realized on the disposition of leased equipment amounted to million during compared to million in and million in assets from greenbrier s lease fleet are periodically sold in the normal course of business in order to take advantage of market conditions  manage risk and maintain liquidity 

table of contents other costs selling and administrative expense was million  million and million in  and the million increase from to is primarily the result of professional fees associated with strategic initiatives and litigation and increases in employee costs 
the million decrease from to is primarily due to cost reduction measures  including reductions in work force  consolidations of facilities and elimination or reduction of non essential costs 
interest expense was million  million and million in  and decreases were the result of lower outstanding debt balances due to scheduled repayments of debt 
pre tax special charges of million were incurred during for severance costs associated with north american operations and legal and professional fees incurred at the corporate level to evaluate european operations 
income tax expense or benefit for all periods presented represents an effective tax rate of on united states operations and varying effective tax rates on foreign operations 
the effective tax rate for continuing operations was for the consolidated effective tax rate for and was and 
the fluctuations in effective tax rates are due to the geographical mix of pre tax earnings and losses 
equity in loss of the mexican joint venture decreased million for as compared to as a result of higher production levels and favorable exchange rates 
the plant resumed deliveries in may after a shutdown that began in january equity in loss of this joint venture increased million for as compared to as a result of the shutdown of the plant for eight months of the year in response to reduced demand for railcars 
the joint venture agreement provides that when certain conditions are met either party can request that the joint venture be dissolved 
such conditions have been met  however  management believes it is not the current intent of either party to make such a request 
liquidity and capital resources greenbrier has been financed through cash generated from operations and borrowings 
at august   cash increased million to million from million at the prior year end 
cash provided by operations for the year ended august   was million compared to million for the same period in the lower amount is primarily due to changes in working capital to support increased production and a payment of participation partially offset by tax refunds received during the year 
cash provided by investing activities for the year ended august  was million compared to million in the prior year 
the increase was a result of elimination of investments in discontinued operations which amounted to million in the prior year and fewer additions to the lease fleet as the company focused on the growth of management services  offset partially by reduced principal payments received under direct finance lease due to the maturation of the portfolio 
cash used in financing activities of million for the year ended august  was a decrease of million from million in the same period in the decline was primarily due to reduced scheduled repayments of borrowings 
the company repaid million in term debt and subordinated debt in compared to million in the prior year 
all amounts originating in foreign currency have been translated at the august  exchange rate for the following discussion 
credit facilities for continuing operations aggregated million as of august  available borrowings under the credit facilities are principally based upon defined levels of receivables  inventory and leased equipment  which at august  levels would provide for maximum borrowing of million 
a million revolving line of credit is available through january to provide working capital and interim financing of equipment for the leasing services operations 
a million line of credit to be used for working capital is available through march for united states manufacturing operations 
an million line of credit is available through february for working capital for canadian manufacturing operations 
advances under the lines of credit bear interest at rates that vary depending on the type of borrowing and certain defined ratios 
at august   there were no borrowings outstanding under the united states manufacturing and leasing services lines while the canadian manufacturing line had million outstanding 
the company has guaranteed certain obligations relating to european discontinued operations consisting of million in notes payable  million in revolving credit facilities  of which million was outstanding at august   and million in bank and third party performance and warranty guarantees  of which million has been utilized at year end 
to date no amounts have been drawn under these guarantees 
approximately of the revolving credit facilities mature in june with the remainder maturing in december 
table of contents in  an agreement was entered into for the purchase and refurbishment of over  used railcars between and the agreement provides that  under certain conditions  the seller will receive a percentage of defined earnings of a subsidiary  and further defines the period when such payments are to be made 
such amounts  referred to as participation  are accrued when earned  charged to leasing services cost of revenue  and unpaid amounts are included as participation in the consolidated balance sheets 
participation expense was million  million and million in  and payment of participation was million in and is estimated to be million in  million in  million in  million in and million in the company has entered into contingent rental assistance agreements  aggregating million  on certain railcars subject to leases that have been sold to third parties 
these agreements guarantee the purchasers a minimum lease rental  subject to a maximum defined rental assistance amount  over periods that range from three to ten years 
a liability is established and revenue is reduced in the period during which a determination can be made that it is probable that a rental shortfall will occur and the amount can be estimated 
for the years ended august   and million  million and million was accrued to cover estimated obligations of which million is remaining as a liability at august  the company and its joint venture partner have each advanced million to an unconsolidated subsidiary for working capital needs 
the advance is secured by accounts receivable and inventory 
capital expenditures for continuing operations totaled million  million and million in  and of these capital expenditures  approximately million  million and million  in  and were attributable to leasing services operations 
leasing services capital expenditures for are expected to be approximately million 
greenbrier regularly sells assets from its lease fleet  some of which may have been purchased within the current year and included in capital expenditures 
approximately million  million and million of capital expenditures for  and were attributable to manufacturing operations 
capital expenditures for manufacturing are expected to be approximately million in and will be limited to expenditures necessary to further enhance efficiencies 
foreign operations give rise to risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
greenbrier utilizes foreign currency forward exchange contracts with established financial institutions to hedge a portion of that risk 
no provision has been made for credit loss due to counterparty non performance 
no dividends were paid during the year  consistent with the company s policy to manage for cash flow and liquidity during the downturn in the railcar industry 
a dividend of per share was declared in the first quarter and paid in the second quarter of quarterly dividends of per share were paid during future dividends are dependent upon the market outlook as well as earnings  capital requirements and financial condition of the company 
certain loan covenants restrict the transfer of funds from subsidiaries to the parent company in the form of cash dividends  loans or advances 
the restricted net assets of subsidiaries amounted to million as of august  consolidated retained earnings of million at august  were restricted as to the payment of dividends 
management expects existing funds and cash generated from operations  together with borrowings under existing credit facilities and long term financing  to be sufficient to fund dividends  if any  working capital needs  planned capital expenditures and expected debt repayments for the foreseeable future 
the following table shows the company s estimated future contractual cash obligations as of august  year ending in thousands total thereafter participation revolving notes notes payable railcar leases operating leases 
table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires judgment on the part of management to arrive at estimates and assumptions on matters that are inherently uncertain 
these estimates may affect the amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses reported in a given period 
estimates and assumptions are periodically evaluated and may be adjusted in future periods 
impairment of long lived assets when changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of certain long lived assets may not be recoverable  the assets will be evaluated for impairment 
if the forecast undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the assets  an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the assets to fair value will be recognized in the current period 
income taxes for financial reporting purposes  the company estimates income tax expense based on planned tax return filings 
the amounts anticipated to be reported in those filings may change between the time the financial statements are prepared and the time the tax returns are filed 
further  because tax filings are subject to review by taxing authorities  there is also the risk that a position taken in preparing a tax return may be challenged by a taxing authority 
if the taxing authority is successful in asserting their position  differences in tax expense or between current and deferred tax items may arise in future periods 
such differences would be reflected in the financial statements when management considers them probable of occurring and the amount reasonably estimable 
valuation allowances may also be provided against deferred tax assets if the realization of such assets is not more likely than not 
management s estimates of the company s ability to realize deferred tax assets is based on the information available at the time the financial statements are prepared and may include estimates of future income and other assumptions that are inherently uncertain 
maintenance obligations the company is responsible for maintenance on a portion of the managed and owned lease fleet whereby the terms of the maintenance obligations are defined in the underlying lease or management agreement 
the estimated liability is based on maintenance histories for each type and age of car 
the liability is periodically reviewed and updated based on maintenance trends and known future repair or refurbishment requirements 
warranty accruals warranty accruals are estimated and charged to operations to cover a defined warranty period 
the estimated warranty cost is based on historical warranty claims for each particular product type 
for new product types without a warranty history  preliminary estimates are based on historical information for similar product types 
the warranty accrual is periodically reviewed and updated based on warranty trends 
contingent rental assistance the company has entered into contingent rental assistance agreements on certain railcars  subject to leases  that have been sold to third parties 
these agreements guarantee the purchasers a minimum lease rental  subject to a maximum defined rental assistance amount  over periods that range from three to ten years 
a liability is established when management believes that it is probable that a rental shortfall will occur and the amount can be estimated 
adjustments to net realizable value the adjustment of net assets of the european operations to estimated net realizable value is based upon various options that management believes could occur 
the nature and type of the transaction that ultimately is negotiated may vary from these options causing the estimate to differ from the amount recorded in the financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
railcars are generally manufactured under firm orders from third parties 
revenue on railcars is recognized when railcars are completed  accepted by an unaffiliated customer and contractual contingencies removed 
marine vessels are constructed under contracts  which may be less than a year in duration 
marine revenues are generally recognized on the percentage of completion method during the construction period 
direct finance lease revenue is recognized over the lease term in a manner that produces a constant rate of return on the net investment in the lease 
operating lease revenue is recognized as earned under the lease terms 
certain leases are operated under car hire arrangements whereby revenue is earned based on utilization  car hire rates and terms specified in the lease agreement 
car hire revenue is reported from a third party source two months in arrears  however  such revenue is accrued in the month earned based on estimates of use from historical activity and is adjusted to actual as reported 
such adjustments have not been material

table of contents results of discontinued operations in august  the company s board of directors committed to a plan to recapitalize operations in europe  which consist of a railcar manufacturing plant in swidnica  poland and a railcar sales  design and engineering operation in siegen  germany 
the european operations have not met expectations for profitability or return on capital invested resulting in the decision to discontinue those operations and refocus resources on north american operations 
european operations are treated as discontinued operations for financial reporting purposes and  accordingly  are not included in any discussions of continuing operations 
in september  the company signed a letter of intent with a private equity group to recapitalize the european operations 
some of the investors in the private equity group issuing the letter of intent are part of an investment group which has a preferred stock ownership interest in and representation on the board of directors of the company s canadian manufacturing subsidiary 
the letter of intent requires satisfactory third party debt financing and final documentation and does not preclude the company from negotiating other offers prior to closing 
greenbrier will also invest additional funds  currently estimated at million  to pay down indebtedness of the recapitalized operation and it will then retain a small minority interest and assume a passive investment role 
under the terms of the letter of intent  the company will be relieved of its guarantee obligations related to revolving lines of credit for discontinued operations of million 
the company anticipates it will continue to guarantee long term debt of million and bank and third party performance  advance payment and warranty guarantees amounting to million as of august  the company may be required to provide performance and warranty guarantees required to be issued on production of backlog subsequent to august   but prior to closing 
it will not issue any additional financial guarantees for the operation after the closing 
the company is in conversation with another unrelated party regarding a potential sale of the european operations 
if the company is unsuccessful in closing a transaction to recapitalize european operations  financial results may be restated as part of continuing operations in future periods 
summarized results of operations related to discontinued operations years ended august  in thousands revenue cost of revenue margin selling and administrative expense interest expense special charges loss from operations adjustment of assets to net realizable value loss before income taxes and minority interest income tax benefit minority interest loss from discontinued operations consists of the million pre tax cost associated with a restructuring plan to decrease operating expenses  consolidate offices and reduce the scale of european operations  and a million pre tax impairment write down of european railcar designs and patents 
includes a million tax benefit in related to deductions for the company s investments in european operations for united states income tax purposes and million and million in and for tax benefits relating to selling and administrative expense reclassifications 
includes reclassification of million and million in and of direct european expenses from continuing operations 

table of contents revenues increased from million in to million in as a result of obtaining certification on certain railcars that were produced in a prior period for which revenue recognition had been delayed pending final certification 
final certification was received in the first quarter of for these cars that have a unit sales value of more than twice the average sales price of other production 
new railcar deliveries in europe were approximately in  in and  in decreases in revenue from million in to million in were the result of lower deliveries due to a cyclical downturn in the railcar market and delivery delays due to certification issues on a certain car type 
margin increased to in from in as the result of a change in product mix  favorable exchange rates and lower depreciation and amortization primarily as a result of asset write downs taken in august decreases in margin from in to in were due to a lower margin product mix and the impact of lower production rates on overhead absorption 
selling and administrative expense decreased to million in as compared to million in due to elimination of amortization associated with the reclassification to a discontinued operation and cost reduction measures implemented in the prior year 
decreases from to were the result of cost reduction measures implemented as part of a restructuring in february capital expenditures for discontinued operations totaled million  million and million in  and the company has guaranteed certain obligations relating to european discontinued operations consisting of million in notes payable  million in revolving credit facilities  of which million was outstanding at august   and million in bank and third party performance and warranty guarantees  of which million has been utilized at year end 
to date no amounts have been drawn under these guarantees 
approximately of the revolving credit facilities mature in with the remainder maturing in december item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk in addition to the united states  greenbrier has operations in canada  mexico  germany and poland that conduct business in their local currencies as well as other regional currencies 
to mitigate its exposure to transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of each entity  greenbrier enters into forward exchange contracts to protect its margin on a portion of its forecast foreign currency sales 
at august   million of forecast sales were hedged by forward exchange contracts 
because of the variety of currencies in which purchases and sales are transacted  it is not possible to predict the impact of a movement in foreign currency exchange rates on future operating results 
however  greenbrier intends to continue to mitigate its exposure to foreign exchange gains or losses 
in addition to greenbrier s exposure to transaction gains or losses  the company is also exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to the net asset position of its foreign subsidiaries 
at august   the net assets of foreign subsidiaries aggregated million 
at august   a uniform strengthening of the united states dollar relative to the foreign currencies would result in a decrease in stockholders equity of million  less than of total stockholders equity 
this calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the united states dollar 
interest rate risk at august   greenbrier s exposure to interest rate risk for both continuing and discontinued operations is limited since of the company s debt has fixed interest rates 
the company actively manages its floating rate debt with interest rate swap agreements  effectively converting million million relates to continuing operations and million relates to discontinued operations of variable rate debt to fixed rate debt at august  as a result  greenbrier is only exposed to interest rate risk relating to its revolving debt and a small portion of term debt 
at august   a uniform increase in interest rates would result in approximately million of additional annual interest expense
