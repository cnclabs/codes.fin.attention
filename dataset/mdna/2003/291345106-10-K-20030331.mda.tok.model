item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general emisphere technologies  inc  is a biopharmaceutical company specializing in the oral delivery of therapeutic macromolecules and other compounds that are not currently deliverable by oral means 
since its inception in  the company has devoted substantially all of its efforts and resources to research and development conducted on its own behalf and through collaborations with corporate partners and academic research institutions 
emisphere has had no product sales to date 
the timing of future product sales depends on many factors  including the company s relationship with partners  the progress of its products in development through clinical trials  regulatory approval  commercialization and market acceptance 
these and other factors that may impact future results are described under risk factors below 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  contract research revenues were million in  representing a decrease of million or compared to the year ended december  revenues for related to research and development expense reimbursement primarily under its collaborative agreements with eli lilly and company  cubist pharmaceuticals  inc  and regeneron pharmaceuticals inc 
cost of contract research revenues approximate such revenues and are included in research and development expenses 
the decrease was primarily attributable to the winding down by emisphere of certain phase i clinical studies in collaboration with eli lilly and company for million in addition to a million decrease due to the near completion of the company s screening phase research  primarily related to its efforts on behalf of cubist pharmaceuticals  inc  regeneron pharmaceuticals inc  and other agreements 
total operating expenses were million for  an increase of million  or  compared to the year ended december  the total operating expenses for  excluding the restructuring costs and loss on asset impairment of million was million  an increase of million  or over the year ended december  the details of this increase are outlined below 
research and development costs were million for the year ended december   a decrease of million or  as compared to the same period in this decrease consisted of a million decrease in clinical trial expenses partially offset by million increase in research costs 
the decrease in clinical trial expenses were primarily due to a million decrease in protect and protect related clinical trial expenses resulting from the completion of the trial partially offset by increased phase i proof of concept clinical expenses primarily for solid oral heparin  oral insulin and rhgh trial expense of million 
the million increase in research cost consisted of million higher compensation expense due to increased headcount that was partially related to the first full year of the operations at farmtech  one time production plant design expenses for the oral liquid heparin delivery agent of million in  increased lease and utility costs of million and million in consulting expenses offset by a decrease in overall research and development expenses resulting from the restructuring announced in may of overall the oral liquid heparin project expense for  excluding restructuring and impairment costs  was million  consisting of million in clinical trial expenses  million in consulting  million in clinical supplies  million production facility design work and million in all other expenses 
with the discontinuance of the liquid oral heparin program and any related initiatives these program costs will not recur in general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  as compared to the same period in this increase was primarily the result of million in bonus payouts  million in increased compensation expense  million in relocation expenses  million in recruiting expense primarily associated with the addition of a chief operating officer and overall salary increases  million in overall occupancy and utility fees partially offset by a million reduction in legal and professional fees 
restructuring on may   the company announced a plan for restructuring its operations  which included the discontinuation of its liquid oral heparin program and any related initiatives  and a reduction of any associated infrastructure 
additionally  in the third quarter of  the company evaluated several alternatives to consolidate its two research facilities in tarrytown  new york and farmington  connecticut in order to eliminate excess capacity  reduce spending  and raise cash 
the decision was made to dispose of the farmington research facility 
as a result of the restructuring plan  the company announced a reduction in force  which was implemented during may and june at the tarrytown facility and november and december for the farmington facility 
the company terminated full time and temporary employees  including administrative personnel and scientists and research assistants 
five employees will remain until final disposition of the farmington research facility 
the company paid approximately 
million in stay bonuses to the severed employees at farmington 
the restructuring plan resulted in the reduction of the company s full time work force by approximately 
the following table presents the original restructuring accruals for tarrytown and farmington  the adjustments to these accruals  and the amounts paid through december  in millions estimated restructuring restructuring actual reserve as of expenses disbursements adjustments december  severance and accrued vacation outplacement services employee benefits contract exit costs other total in addition  the company forgave loans to certain terminated employees and recognized compensation expense of million 
the million remaining reserve is expected to be paid in the second quarter of the reserve is included in accounts payable and accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheet as of december  loss on impairment of intangible and fixed assets in connection with the results of the oral liquid heparin clinical trials  management performed an evaluation of the recoverability of certain intangible and fixed assets related to the oral liquid heparin program and related initiatives 
management concluded that a total impairment of the portion of the purchased technology intangible asset  representing patents related to the liquid form of oral heparin was required because the company does not anticipate realization of the carrying value of this asset 
the company recorded a million impairment charge 
at december   management performed an evaluation of the recoverability of the remaining purchased technology related to the solid forms of oral heparin 
since the studies related to this formulation are proceeding as planned  management estimates that future undiscounted cash flows from programs related to the solid form of oral heparin are still valid and therefore  an impairment of the remaining purchased technology has not been triggered as of december  the book value of the remaining purchased technology is approximately million 
a negative outcome in the development of solid oral heparin may trigger a write down of related patents of million in the future 
in addition  an impairment of a reactor and associated accessories  which was to be used only for manufacture of oral liquid heparin  and a gene chip array system and related accessories had occurred 
during the year  the company recorded a million impairment charge  representing the reduction of the carrying value of the reactor and gene chip array system and associated accessories to their fair value  based on the sale of the machinery to third parties 
in connection with the decision to dispose of the farmington  connecticut research facility  management performed an evaluation of the recoverability of land  building and equipment at the farmington research facility 
the evaluation was based on the weighted average probability of estimated undiscounted future cash flows from five expressions of interest from third parties 
based on this evaluation  an impairment loss of the carrying value of the land  building and equipment has not been triggered as of december  the carrying value of land  building  and equipment as of december  was approximately million 
emisphere continues to be in discussions with potential buyers of its connecticut facility with proposals ranging from continuing operations as a research facility to selling the facility and the acres of land surrounding the facility 
in the event that the company is not successful in selling the farmington facility  the company will need to write down the carrying value of the land  building and equipment further 
depreciation and amortization costs were million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  as compared to the same period in this increase is mainly the result of depreciation expense related to the farmington research facility  which was acquired in april  along with amortization expense for leasehold improvements related to additional laboratory and office space placed into service at the tarrytown facility in as a result  the operating loss was million including the restructuring and impairment charges in the year ended december   an increase of million as compared to a million operating loss for the year ended december  excluding the restructuring and asset impairment charges the operating loss was million in the year ended december  or an increase of million compared to the same period last year 
other income and expense changed to approximately million of expense for the year ended december  as compared to million of income in the same period of the change is primarily the result of a decrease in investment income of million  plus an increase in interest expense of million related to the note due to elan corporation  plc 
the decrease in investment income resulted from lower cash and investment balances and lower interest rates 
the company also recorded a million other than temporary impairment charge to write down to fair value its million investment in the preferred stock of a biotech company with products that could potentially use emisphere s oral delivery technology 
the company considered the following factors to be primary indicators of impairment i 
the biotech company s need to raise sufficient capital to ensure funding of its research and development projects  ii 
the inability to meet payment obligations as they become due and iii 
the possibility that the company may not be able to continue as a going concern unless additional financing is obtained 
fair value was estimated based on the price of the biotech company s publicly traded common stock 
based on the above  emisphere sustained a net loss of million including restructuring and impairment charges in the year ended december  as compared to a net loss of million in the same period of  an increase of million or 
excluding the restructuring and impairment charges our net loss was million in the year ended december  or an increase of million or compared to the same period last year 
the company s costs in the first half of were relatively high due to payments related to the phase iii protect trial and related studies 
since the conclusion of these trials and subsequent restructuring  overall operating costs have decreased dramatically 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  contract research revenues were million in  representing a decrease of million or compared to the year ended december  the decrease was primarily attributable to the absence of revenues from the novartis pharma ag development program  including a non recurring milestone payment in and the near completion of the company s related research efforts 
revenues for related to research and development expense reimbursement primarily under our collaborative agreements with eli lilly and company  cubist pharmaceuticals  inc  and regeneron pharmaceuticals inc 
costs of contract research revenues approximate such revenues and are included in research and development expenses 
total operating expenses were million for  an increase of million  or  compared to the year ended december  the details of the increase are as follows research and development costs were million for  an increase of million  or  compared to the year ended december  this increase is mainly attributable to an increase of million related to conducting phase i and phase iii clinical trials for our product candidates 
the remainder of the increase was primarily due to increased outside laboratory fees and laboratory supply expenses of million  salaries of million  and cost of occupancy of million associated with the increased activities under collaborative and proprietary development programs 
general and administrative expenses were million in  an increase of million  or  compared to the year ended december  this increase is primarily the result of increased legal and professional fees  general occupancy costs  and salaries to support the increase in research activity 
depreciation and amortization was million in  an increase of million  or  compared to the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to depreciation of equipment and leasehold improvements made in as we expanded our facilities at tarrytown  new york and acquired land  building and equipment in connecticut 
other income and expenses were million of net income in  a decrease of million  or  compared to the year ended december  this decrease is primarily the result of a million decrease in investment income resulting from lower cash  investment balances  and interest rates and an increase of million in non cash interest accrued on a note payable 
based on the above factors  we sustained a net loss of million in an increase of million compared to a net loss of million in the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources as of december   the company had cash  cash equivalents and investments totaling million  a decrease of million  compared to december  net cash used in operations was million in  as compared to million in the year ended december  the increase in cash used in operations primarily occurred in the first half of and was related to the proof of concept phase i and ii clinical trials as well as the completion of our oral heparin solution phase iii clinical development program and the related support spending 
after completion of the phase iii clinical trial for oral liquid heparin and the restructuring of the company announced in may  the use of cash dropped significantly 
capital expenditures were approximately million in compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in capital expenditures is primarily due to the termination of all capital projects as well as the new business model adopted after the restructuring  as outlined below 
net cash provided by financing activities was approximately million in  compared to million during the year ended december  or an increase of million 
the proceeds from the exercise of stock options decreased from million in to million in  due to lower prices of the company s common stock and fewer employee exercises 
in  the company used million of cash to repurchase its common stock 
emisphere s business model is to conduct proof of concept phase i and ii clinical trials with the objective of attracting a partner to commercialize our product without our funding 
this business model will significantly reduce its cash requirements in that the company does not plan to self fund projects beyond phase i and ii clinical trials 
in the company expects no oral heparin solution clinical development expenses as the program was discontinued in may however  given its new business model of out licensing and focusing on partnerships rather than on self development of projects  the company expects to expand the company s efforts to partner its products  including oral insulin  solid heparin  cromolyn sodium and other projects 
as a result  even though the company expects to continue to incur operating losses  these losses are estimated to be significantly less that those incurred in likewise  emisphere s cash requirements are expected to continue to decrease due to the change in the company s business model 
these reduced costs include  but are not limited to  decreases in personnel related costs and operating costs at the tarrytown and the connecticut facilities  leasing of certain capital equipment  and potential sub leasing of office space in the tarrytown facility 
capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of to million in purchases may be financed by a lease arrangement 
emisphere expects its cash  cash equivalent and investment balances to decrease by to million in ending the year at approximately million 
this level of cash usage assumes that we will not enter into partnership agreements for either solid oral heparin or oral insulin 
if the company were to develop solid oral heparin and insulin without a partner  it would limit our development programs at a point prior to entering into a phase iii clinical trial 
in  in the absence of a partnership  the company may be required to raise additional funds 
conversely  if the company enters into a collaboration agreement to develop oral heparin or oral insulin  depending upon the terms of the partnership  emisphere could receive expense reimbursement and or cash infusions 
such fundings may delay the company s need for equity financing to maintain operations beyond in addition to  shares of the company s common stock which had been repurchased in prior years  in september  the company enacted a share repurchase program  which our board of directors authorized for up to million 
during  the company repurchased an additional  shares of our common stock for a total of million 
the current share repurchase program was terminated in october such stock  which is deemed to be treasury stock  is recorded at cost 
from time to time  in order to meet corporate needs  we may repurchase further shares of our common stock 
the timing of stock repurchases is made at the discretion of management  with the approval of our board of directors 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations for long term debt  clinical research organization expense and research consulting agreements amount due in less than more than type of obligation total obligation year to years to years years long term debt million million clinical research organizations million million research consultant agreements million million total million million million million note payable to elan in connection with the purchase of ebbisham ltd 
due in july  accrued interest to accumulate to million if held to maturity  payable in cash or emisphere stock at emisphere s option  balance due at december  was approximately million 
critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states involves the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the recorded amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
certain of these estimates and assumptions are considered to be critical accounting policies  due to their complexity  subjectivity  and uncertainty  along with their relevance to the financial performance of the company 
actual results may differ substantially from these estimates 
these policies and their key characteristics are outlined below 
investments 
the company invests excess cash in accordance with a policy objective seeking to preserve both liquidity and safety of principal 
the company considers all highly liquid  interest bearing debt instruments with maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents 
cash and cash equivalents include demand deposits held in banks and interest bearing money market funds 
investments are carried at fair value and  are considered to be available for sale 
accordingly  unrealized holding gains and losses are reported in stockholders equity 
the company generally invests its excess funds in obligations of the us government and its agencies  bank deposits  mortgage backed securities  and investment grade debt securities issued by corporations and financial institutions at ratings of a or a standard and poor s 
although the company s investments carry high ratings when purchased  a lowering of the rating of the corporate debt securities in our portfolio could result in impairment to our investments 
purchased technology 
purchased technology represents the value assigned to patents underlying research and development projects of ebbisham ltd  related to oral heparin  that were commenced but not yet completed as of the date of the company s acquisition of full ownership and which  if unsuccessful  have no alternative future use 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the fair value of purchased technology is reviewed for impairment on a quarterly basis or whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value might not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount exceeds its fair value  which is based upon estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
at december   purchased technology is approximately million  net of amortization 
the company amortizes purchased technology on a straight line basis over a period of years  the average life of the related patents 
estimated amortization expense for the purchased technology intangible asset is  for each of the next five fiscal years 
if there is an impairment in the purchased technology intangible asset  this amount could be significantly different 
impairment of long lived assets 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the company reviews its long lived assets for impairment on a quarterly basis or whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset might not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the long lived asset exceeds its fair value  which is based upon estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
in the third quarter of  the company evaluated several alternatives to consolidate its two research locations in tarrytown  new york and farmington  connecticut in order to eliminate excess capacity  reduce spending and raise cash 
the decision was made to dispose of the farmington research facility 
in the fourth quarter  the company evaluated the recoverability of the land  building and equipment at the farmington research facility 
the evaluation was based on the weighted average probability of certain estimated undiscounted future cash flows from five expressions of interest from third parties 
based on estimates of expected proceeds  no impairment was recognized 
the company estimated the proceeds of the sale of the lab equipment to be of net book value 
if the company based its estimates on the same weighted average probability of expected cash flows  but received no value for the equipment  the impairment charge would be in the range of million 
if the company receives the lowest offer and a return on the equipment  our impairment would be in the range of million 
if the company received the next highest offer and a return on the equipment  our impairment charge would be in the range of million 
the remaining offers  if taken individually would provide the company with a gain on sale 
in the event that the company is not successful in selling the farmington facility  the company will need to write down the carrying value of the land  building and equipment further 
clinical trial accrual methodology 
clinical trial expenses represent obligations resulting from the company s contracts with various research organizations in connection with conducting clinical trials for the company s product candidates 
the company accounts for those expenses on an accrual basis according to the progress of the trial as measured by patient enrolment and the timing of the various aspects of the trial 
accruals are recorded as follows contract costs are broken down based on the nature and the timing of costs  the costs for period expenses  such as investigator meetings and initial start up costs  are expensed as incurred based on management s estimates  such estimates are impacted by the change in the number of sites and recruitment of patients and when they start  direct service costs are recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the contract on going monitoring costs  and principal investigator expenses that are directly associated with recruitment are recognized based on actual patient recruitment 
all changes to the contract amounts due to change orders are analyzed and recognized in accordance with the above methodology 
change orders are triggered by changes in the scope  time to completion and the number of sites 
the company adjusts its estimates of expenses to reflect actual expenses 
revenue recognition 
contract research revenues consist of revenue from collaborative agreements and feasibility studies and are comprised of reimbursed research and development costs  as well as upfront and research and development milestone payments 
deferred revenue represents payments received  which are related to future performance 
non refundable upfront and research and development milestone payments and payments for services are recognized as revenue as the related services are performed over the term of the collaboration 
revenue recognized is the lower of i the percentage complete  measured by incurred costs  applied to expected contractual payments or ii the total non refundable cash received to date 
with regards to our revenues from non refundable fees  changes in our assumptions of estimated costs to complete could have a material impact on the revenue we recognize 
contract research revenues are expected to fluctuate from year to year and are dependent upon the timing of work plans mutually agreed to with collaborators and to the allocation of efforts between ourselves and our collaborators 
research project spending emisphere has devoted substantially all of our efforts and resources to research and development conducted on its own behalf self funded and through collaborations with corporate partners partnered 
due to the uncertainties and risk factors as described below  including the progress of its products in development through clinical trials  regulatory approval  commercialization and market acceptance  it is not possible to reliably predict future spending or time to completion by project or project category 
the following table summarizes research and development spending by project category in thousands five months year cumulative year ended ended ended spending december  december  july to date feasibility projects self funded    partnered  development projects oral heparin self funded       partnered       all other self funded 
other       total all projects 
      cumulative spending from august  through december  during the year ending december   million of research and development expense  related to certain projects  was reclassified to restructuring for severance charges in the consolidated statement of operations 
transactions with related parties during  the company paid million to a former member of the board of directors  subsequent to the cancellation of his vested stock options  and recognized compensation expense for that amount 
future impact of recently issued accounting standards 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities fas 
fas nullifies emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
fas requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred  rather than on the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan and establishes that fair value as the objective for initial measurement of the liability 
the provisions of this statement shall be effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  the provisions of issue shall continue to apply for an exit activity initiated under an exit plan that met the criteria of issue prior to this statement s initial application 
the company adopted fas on january  on december   the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fas fas 
fas provides several transition provisions that may be used upon adoption of the accounting provisions of fas fas also mandates certain new disclosures  whether or not fas is adopted  that are incremental to those required by fas those disclosures must be made in both interim and annual financial statements 
the transition and annual disclosure provisions of fas are effective for fiscal years ending after december  the new interim disclosure provisions are effective for the first interim period beginning after december  on november   the eitf finalized issue no 
accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  eitf which addresses how to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting 
eitf also addresses how arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate units of accounting in the arrangement 
the guidance in eitf is effective for revenue arrangements entered into for interim and annual periods beginning after june  on november   the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december   irrespective of the guarantor s fiscal year end 
the disclosure requirements in this interpretation are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  these standards may apply to the company should transactions falling within the scope of these standards arise in the future 
risk factors the following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward looking statements that we make in this report and elsewhere including oral statements from time to time 
any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business  our operating results  our financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward looking statements are made in this report 
risks related to emisphere technologies emisphere is highly dependent on the clinical success of our oral heparin and oral insulin products 
one of emisphere s leading product candidates it s developing and hope to partner is a solid oral heparin 
heparin is currently not available in oral form 
this is the second form of oral heparin that the company is attempting to develop after its first attempt at developing an oral heparin in liquid form did not meet its targeted endpoint of superiority to lovenox 
the company commenced phase iii clinical trials protect for this solution form of product in and began dosing patients in january this trial was completed in early and did not meet its endpoint of superiority 
as a result  all further development of oral heparin solution was terminated 
the company s next leading product  a solid oral heparin which is in phase i testing  is also inherently risky  and the outcome of its development is subject to uncertainty  as was the liquid form 
while emisphere s objective is to show the superiority equivalence non inferiority of solid oral heparin to an existing therapy  the company cannot assure that future data will in fact demonstrate superiority equivalence non inferiority in the phase i or later stage clinical studies nor can the company be assured that it can engage in a partnership to enter into phase ii and iii studies for the development of this product candidate 
should this candidate be successful  there are still risks in commercialization 
another leading product candidate emisphere is developing and hopes to partner is an oral form of insulin 
insulin is currently only available as an injection for type i and type ii patients 
we are aware that other companies are currently developing alternative forms of delivery for insulin in spray buccal or aerosol pulmonary forms and that this is a highly competitive area with a large market risk 
the company has evaluated the performance of this product candidate in early patient testing in both type i and type ii patients 
while the company believes that an oral insulin has the potential to be an improved therapy for diabetics  and it has demonstrated favorable data in early patient studies  it cannot assure that this  or future data will in fact demonstrate that this product will be better than existing therapy in forthcoming studies nor can it be assured that it can engage in a partnership to enter into a development program for this product candidate 
should this candidate be successful  there are still risks in commercialization 
in addition  the manufacture  marketing and distribution of pharmaceuticals is a formidable undertaking 
the company does not have the marketing expertise to bring oral forms of heparin or insulin to market on its own and our competitors may have more resources and or experience in bringing their product candidates to market 
oral heparin potential partnership status in july  we reacquired all product  marketing and technology rights for emisphere s heparin products from elan corporation  plc  which had been our joint venture partner since until the company enters into a new partnership agreement  the company remains responsible for the clinical trials  development  manufacturing  marketing and distribution of our oral forms of heparin 
in accordance with the elan agreement  emisphere will be required to pay elan royalties on emisphere sales which are capped on an annual basis 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
the company continues to seek a partner for this product candidate to conduct later stage development and potential commercialization efforts 
oral insulin potential partnership status in  an oral insulin partnership had been disclosed as a near term milestone as a result of late stage negotiations with a partnered entity 
on march   emisphere received a letter stating that the entity would no longer pursue the partnership 
emisphere disclosed that the entity s decision to no longer pursue a partnership for the oral insulin program  and emisphere s decision to continue to develop this program would not affect the fiscal budget 
until emisphere enters into a partnership agreement  it remains responsible for the clinical trials  development  manufacturing  marketing and distribution of its oral forms of insulin 
the company continues to seek a partner for this product candidate to conduct later stage development and potential commercialization efforts 
the company s product candidates are in various stages of development  and emisphere cannot be certain that any will be suitable for commercial purposes 
to be profitable  the company must successfully research  develop  obtain regulatory approval for  manufacture  introduce  market and distribute our products under development  or find a partner to assist us financially and logistically with these steps 
the time necessary to achieve these goals for any individual product is long and uncertain 
before the company or a potential partner can sell any of our products under development  the company must demonstrate through preclinical animal studies and clinical human trials that each product is safe and effective for human use for each targeted indication 
the company cannot be certain that emisphere or its current or future partners will be able to begin  or continue  our planned clinical trials for our product candidates  or if it is able  that its product candidates will prove to be safe and will produce their intended effects 
a number of companies in the drug delivery  biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries have suffered significant setbacks in clinical trials  even after showing promising results in earlier studies or trials 
emisphere cannot assure you that favorable results in any preclinical study or early clinical trial will mean that favorable results will ultimately be obtained in future clinical trials 
nor can emisphere assure you that results of our limited animal and human studies are indicative of results that would be achieved in future animal studies or human clinical studies  all or some of which will be required in order to have its proposed products obtain regulatory approval 
similarly  emisphere cannot assure you that any of its product candidates will be approved by the fda 
emisphere s future business success depends heavily upon regulatory approvals  which can be difficult to obtain for a variety of reasons  including cost 
emisphere s preclinical studies and clinical trials  as well as the manufacturing and marketing of its technologies  are subject to extensive  costly and rigorous regulation by various governmental authorities in the united states and other countries 
the process of obtaining required regulatory approvals from the fda and other regulatory authorities often takes many years  is expensive and can vary significantly based on the type  complexity and novelty of the product candidates 
emisphere cannot assure you that any technologies or delivery agents developed by the company  either independently or in collaboration with others  will meet the applicable regulatory criteria in order to receive the required approvals for manufacturing and marketing 
delays in obtaining united states or foreign approvals for its self funded projects could result in substantial additional costs to the company  and  therefore  could adversely affect our ability to compete with other companies 
additionally  delays in obtaining regulatory approvals encountered by others with whom we collaborate  or other licensees of ours  could also adversely affect our business and prospects 
if regulatory approval of a product is granted  the approval may place limitations on the intended uses of the product the company wishes to commercialize  and may restrict the way in which the company is permitted to market the product  either of which may affect cost greatly 
the company is dependent upon collaborative partners to develop and commercialize compounds using our delivery agents 
a key part of the company s strategy is to form collaborations with pharmaceutical companies that will assist us in developing  testing  obtaining government approval for and commercializing oral forms of therapeutic compounds using our drug delivery technologies 
the company does not currently possess the ability or resources necessary to reach these goals alone  and it does not currently intend independently to market products incorporating our technologies in the foreseeable future 
other than our strategic alliances with novartis  lilly  and regeneron we have no commitments or development agreements currently in effect 
accordingly  the company cannot assure you that o it will be able to enter into collaborative arrangements to develop products utilizing its drug delivery technologies  o any existing or future collaborative arrangements will be successful  or o milestones in these agreements will be met 
if the company is unable to obtain development assistance and funds from other pharmaceutical companies to fund a portion of its product development costs and to commercialize products  the company may have to delay  scale back or curtail one or more of its projects 
the company has incurred substantial losses since inception and may require additional capital 
since the company s inception in  it has generated significant losses from operations and it anticipates that it will continue to generate significant losses from operations for the foreseeable future 
on december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million 
operations to date have been funded with the proceeds from collaborative research agreements  public and private equity and debt financings and income earned on investments 
the company expects to continue clinical development expenses for self funded projects including solid oral heparin and oral insulin clinical development expenses in as it conducts phase i ii clinical trials 
the company expects no significant oral heparin solution clinical development expenses as the program was discontinued in may however  given its new business model of out licensing and focusing on partnerships not self development of projects  the company expects to expand its efforts to partner its products  including oral insulin  solid heparin  cromolyn sodium and other projects 
as a result  even though the company expects to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future  however these losses are estimated to be significantly less that those incurred in emisphere s business model is to conduct proof of concept phase i and ii clinical trials with the objective to attract a partner to commercialize our product without our funding 
this business model will significantly reduce its cash requirements in that it does not plan on self funding projects 
the company anticipates that its existing capital resources will enable us to continue operations through the end of without raising additional capital 
however  this expectation is based on the current operating plan  that could change as a result of many factors  and the company may need additional funding sooner than anticipated 
to the extent operating and capital resources are insufficient to meet future requirements  it will have to raise additional funds to continue the development and commercialization of its products or reduce spending by cutting spending on non critical projects 
the ability to raise funds in the future may not be available on favorable terms  or at all 
to the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of such securities could result in dilution to its existing stockholders 
actual savings and improvements in operations from current restructurings may be lower than expected 
the ultimate sale of the connecticut facility may not occur for the foreseeable future and the costs of closing the facility may still require cash outlays for utilities  insurance  maintenance  lawn care and real estate taxes 
even if the facility sells  it may sell for less than the company estimated  resulting in an impairment charge 
if the company cannot adequately protect its patent and proprietary rights  the company business will suffer 
although the company has patents for some of its product candidates and have applied for additional patents  there can be no assurance that patents applied for will be granted  that patents granted to or acquired by us now or in the future will be valid and enforceable and provide us with meaningful protection from competition or that we will possess the financial resources necessary to enforce any of its patents 
there can also be no assurance that any products that emisphere or a licensee develop will not infringe upon any patent or other intellectual property right of a third party 
emisphere also relies upon trade secrets  know how and continuing technological advances to develop and maintain our competitive position 
the company maintains a policy of requiring employees  scientific advisors  consultants and collaborators to execute confidentiality and invention assignment agreements upon commencement of a relationship with emisphere 
the company cannot assure you  however  that these agreements will provide meaningful protection for its trade secrets in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information 
emisphere s success also depends  in part  on its ability to obtain patent protection for its products  processes and technologies  to preserve its trade secrets  and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties  in various jurisdictions 
emisphere cannot assure you that any patent applications relating to its potential products or processes will result in patents being issued  or that resulting patents  if any  are valid  enforceable or will provide protection against competitors who challenge its patents  obtain patents that may have an adverse effect on its ability to conduct business  or are able to circumvent its patent position 
emisphere cannot assure you that we will have the necessary financial resources to enforce any of our patents 
part of emisphere s strategy involves collaborative arrangements with other pharmaceutical companies for the development of new formulations of drugs developed by others and  ultimately  the receipt of royalties on sales of the new formulations of those drugs 
these drugs are generally the property of the pharmaceutical companies and may be the subject of patents or patent applications and other forms of protection owned by the pharmaceutical companies 
to the extent those patents or other forms of protection expire  become invalid or otherwise ineffective  or to the extent those drugs are covered by patents or other forms of protection owned by third parties  sales of those drugs by the collaborating pharmaceutical company may be restricted  limited  enjoined  or may cease 
accordingly  the potential for royalty revenues to us may be adversely affected 
the company may be at risk of having to obtain a license from partners making proprietary improvements to the company s technology 
there is a risk that a partner may make improvements or innovations to the company s technology and that emisphere may need to obtain a license from that partnership 
royalties payable under such a license  if obtainable  would reduce emisphere s share of total revenue 
the company is dependent on third parties to manufacture and in some cases  test emisphere s products 
while as of  the company now has a gmp compliant facility to manufacture a limited number of clinical supplies related to our emisphere delivery agents  the company currently has no manufacturing facilities for large scale clinical or commercial production of any compounds under consideration as products 
the company also has no research facilities for later stage product candidate testing prior to first human testing 
management is currently evaluating its options to manufacture or rely on third parties 
the company may face product liability claims related to participation in clinical trials or the use or misuse of its products 
the company has product liability insurance with a policy limit of million per occurrence and in the aggregate 
the testing  manufacturing and marketing of products for humans utilizing its drug delivery technologies may expose us to potential product liability and other claims resulting from their use 
liability may also result from claims made directly by consumers or by pharmaceutical companies or others selling emsiphere products 
the company seeks to structure future development programs with pharmaceutical companies that would complete the development  manufacturing and marketing of the finished product  but the indemnity undertakings for product liability claims that we secure from the pharmaceutical companies may later prove to be insufficient 
risks related to our industry the company faces rapid technological change and intense competition 
the company s success depends  in part  upon maintaining a competitive position in the development of products and technologies in an evolving field in which developments are expected to continue at a rapid pace 
the company competes with other drug delivery  biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  research organizations  individual scientists and non profit organizations engaged in the development of alternative drug delivery technologies or new drug research and testing  as well as with entities developing new drugs that may be orally active 
many of these competitors have greater research and development capabilities  experience  and marketing  financial and managerial resources than we do  and  therefore  represent significant competition for the company 
the company s products  when developed and marketed  may compete with existing injectable versions of the same drug  some of which are well established in the marketplace and manufactured by formidable competitors  as well as other existing drugs 
for example  the company s oral heparin product candidate  if successful  would compete with injectable heparin  injectable low molecular weight heparin and warfarin  an oral anti coagulant 
these products are marketed throughout the world by very large companies such as aventis sa  pharmacia upjohn  inc and bristol myers squibb 
similarly  our salmon calcitonin product candidate  if developed and marketed  would compete with a wide array of existing osteoporosis therapies  including a nasal dosage form of salmon calcitonin  estrogen replacement therapy  bisphosphonates and selective receptor modulators 
the company s competitors may succeed in developing competing technologies or obtaining government approval for products before we do 
developments by others may render our product candidates  or the therapeutic compounds used in combination with its product candidates  noncompetitive or obsolete 
for example  the company is aware that astrazeneca plc has completed phase iii clinical trials of a pro drug form of melagantran  a direct thrombin inhibitor  which  if successfully developed  would compete with our oral heparin products 
similarly  the company is aware that nobex corporation has an oral insulin formulation being developed by glaxosmithkline and that at least one competitor has notified the fda that it is developing a competing formulation of salmon calcitonin 
the company cannot assure you that  if our products are marketed  they will be preferred to existing drugs or that they will be preferred to or available before other products in development

risks relating to the company s common stock anti takeover provisions of the company s corporate charter documents  delaware law and its agreements with collaborators may affect the price of the company s common stock 
emisphere s board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the rights  preferences and privileges of those shares without any further vote or action by its stockholders 
of these  shares   are currently designated series a junior participating cumulative preferred stock in connection with its stockholders rights plan  and the remaining  shares remain available for future issuance 
your rights as a holder of common stock may be adversely affected by the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
additional provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by laws could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting common stock 
these include provisions that classify our board of directors  limit the ability of stockholders to take action by written consent  call special meetings  remove a director for cause  amend the by laws or approve a merger with another company 
the company also has a stockholder s right s plan  commonly referred to as a poison pill  that makes it difficult  if not impossible  for a person to acquire control of the company without the consent of our board of directors 
emisphere is subject to the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law which prohibits a publicly held delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder  unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner 
for purposes of section  a business combination includes a merger  asset sale or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder  and an interested stockholder is a person who  either alone or together with affiliates and associates  owns or within the past three years  did own or more of the corporation s voting stock 
emisphere s stock price has been and may continue to be volatile 
the trading price for the company s common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile 
the market prices for securities of drug delivery  biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies have historically been highly volatile 
factors that could adversely affect the company s stock price include o fluctuations in the company s operating results  o announcements of partnerships or technological collaborations  innovations or new products by emisphere or its competitors  o governmental regulation  o developments in patent or other proprietary rights  o public concern as to the safety of drugs developed by emisphere or others  o the results of preclinical testing and clinical studies or trials by emisphere  our partners or our competitors  o litigation  o general market conditions  o number of shares available for trading float 
o inclusion in or dropping from stock indexes 
future sales of common stock  or the prospect of future sales  may depress the company s stock price 
sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock  or the perception that sales could occur  could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
as of december   emisphere has outstanding options to purchase up to  shares of common stock which are currently exercisable and additional options to purchase up to  shares of common stock are exercisable over the next several years 
in addition  an aggregate of  shares of common stock have been reserved for issuance under our directors deferred compensation plan  of which  shares are currently issuable 
the holders of these options or rights have an opportunity to profit from a rise in the market price of our common stock with a resulting dilution in the interests of the other 
the existence of these options or rights may adversely affect the terms on which we may obtain additional financing 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk emisphere s primary investment objective is to preserve principal while maximizing yield without significantly increasing our risk 
our investments consist of us treasuries  commercial paper and corporate notes 
the company s investments totaled million at december  approximately million  of which million were short term and million were long term investments  had fixed interest rates  and million  of which million were short term  and million were long term investments  with variable interest rates 
due to the conservative nature of its short term fixed interest rate investments maturities in less than one year  the company does not believe that we have a material exposure to interest rate risk 
the company s fixed interest rate long term investments are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
interest rate changes would result in a change in the fair value of these investments due to differences between the market interest rate and the rate at the date of purchase of the investment 
a basis point increase in the year end market interest rates would result in a decrease of approximately million in the market values of these investments
