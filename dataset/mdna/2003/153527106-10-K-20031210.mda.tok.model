overview central garden pet company is a leading innovator  marketer and producer of quality branded products for the pet and lawn and garden supplies markets 
we are one of the largest companies in the fragmented  billion billion us pet supplies industry and in the billion us lawn and garden supplies industry 
our pet products include pet bird and small animal food  wild bird food  aquarium products  flea  tick  mosquito and other insect control products  edible bones  cages  carriers  pet books  and other dog  cat  reptile and small animal products 
these products are sold under a number of brand names  including kaytee  all glass aquarium  oceanic  zodiac  pre strike  altosid  nylabone  tfh and four paws 
our lawn and garden products include grass seed  wild bird food  weed and insect control products  decorative outdoor patio products and ant control products 
these products are sold under a number of brand names  including pennington  norcal pottery  lilly miller  matthews four seasons  amdro and grant s 
in fiscal  our consolidated net sales were billion  of which our pet products segment  or pet products  accounted for million and our lawn and garden products segment  or garden products  accounted for million 
in fiscal  our income from operations was million  of which pet products accounted for million and garden products accounted for million  before corporate expenses and eliminations of million 
background during the past several years  we have transitioned our company to a leading marketer and producer of branded products from a traditional pet and lawn and garden supplies distributor 
we initiated this transition because we recognized the opportunity to build a portfolio of leading brands and improve profitability by capitalizing on our knowledge of the pet and lawn and garden supplies sectors  our strong relationships with retailers and our nationwide sales and logistics network 
our goal was to diversify our business and improve operating margins by establishing a portfolio of leading brands 
since  we have acquired numerous branded products companies and product lines  including wellmark and four paws in fiscal  kaytee products  tfh and pennington seed in fiscal  norcal pottery in fiscal  and amdro and all glass aquarium in fiscal while expanding our branded products business  we experienced adverse events in our distribution business 
from to  we were the master distributor of round up and ortho products 
in january  the scotts company  one of our largest distribution suppliers at the time  acquired ortho and became the marketing agent for round up 
in july  scotts terminated its relationship with us 
due to these events  we significantly downsized our garden distribution operations and closed a total of facilities from fiscal to fiscal we have incurred significant legal expenses associated with lawsuits with scotts and others 
in fiscal  we integrated our sales and logistics networks into our pet and lawn and garden products businesses to allow us to focus resources and provide strategic sales support for our brands 
virtually all of our sales before fiscal were from distributing other manufacturers products 
since then  our branded product sales have grown to approximately million  or approximately of total sales  in fiscal during this same period  our sales of other manufacturers products have declined to approximately million  approximately of total sales  and our gross profit margins have improved from in fiscal to in fiscal 
table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the relative percentages that certain income and expense items bear to net sales fiscal year ended september  september  september  net sales cost of goods sold and occupancy gross profit selling  general and administrative income from operations interest expense  net other income income taxes income loss before cumulative effect of accounting change cumulative effect of accounting change  net of tax net income loss fiscal compared to fiscal net sales net sales for fiscal increased million  or  to  million from  million in fiscal this was due primarily to a million  or  increase in our branded product sales 
all branded product sales growth was organic 
sales of our own branded products represented of our total sales in fiscal year garden products sales for fiscal increased million  or  to million from million in fiscal contributing to the sales increase in garden products was increased sales of our own branded products led by strong sales of our grass seed  wild bird food and ant control products  partially offset by a minor reduction in sales of other manufacturers products 
pet products sales for fiscal increased million  or  to million from million in fiscal contributing to the sales increase in pet products were increased sales of our own branded products resulting from the continued strength of our insect control products  including pre strike  our new consumer mosquito control product  increased bird food sales  and increased aquarium sales 
gross profit gross profit increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal pet products gross profit increased million  or  reflecting increased gross profit from sales of our own branded products and increased margin for other manufacturers products 
garden products gross profit increased million  or  reflecting increased sales of our own branded products 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal  reflecting decreases from to in pet products and from to in garden products 
the decline in gross margin was due primarily to the impact of higher than normal grain prices caused by last year s drought in the plains states  partially offset by increased sales of our higher margin branded products 
we are now seeing wild bird feed margins recover to more normal levels and expect gross margins to improve in fiscal year 
table of contents selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease was due primarily to decreased administrative costs  partially offset by increased selling and delivery expenses 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased from during fiscal to during fiscal selling and delivery expenses increased by million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase was due primarily to increased sales and higher advertising expenses 
selling and delivery expenses as a percentage of net sales increased from in fiscal to in fiscal advertising expenses included an aggressive advertising campaign for the launch of pre strike and a significantly increased consumer advertising campaign for our fire ant bait brand 
facilities expenses decreased million from million in fiscal to million in the decrease was shared by both pet products and garden products due to the decreased number of sales and logistics centers and shutdown costs that were absorbed in fiscal warehouse and administrative expenses decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal garden products decreased million  pet products decreased million and corporate decreased million 
the decreases were due primarily to a million reduction in legal and litigation expenses and million in reduced costs due to the impact of facility closures in fiscal additionally  increased sales and inventory levels in fiscal reduced the amount of purchasing  merchandise  handling and storage costs charged to warehouse and administration expense and instead included as inventory costs 
these decreases were offset partially by increased health care and workers compensation insurance expenses 
other income other income decreased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease was due primarily to million of life insurance proceeds  partially offset by a million write off of goodwill associated with an unsuccessful equity method investment  recorded in fiscal earnings from equity method investments were million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal interest expense net interest expense increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal of this increase  million represented fees and expenses associated with the early retirement of our convertible subordinated notes in january and the refinancing of our senior credit facility in may the remainder of the increase was due primarily to higher interest expense associated with the issuance in january of our million percent senior subordinated notes due average borrowings for fiscal were million compared to million in fiscal the average interest rates for fiscal and were and  respectively 
income taxes our effective income tax rate in fiscal was compared with in fiscal  before the cumulative effect of accounting change 
our marginal tax rate is generally 
the difference between the marginal tax rate and the effective tax rate in fiscal was due primarily to utilization of state income tax credits and in fiscal was due primarily to non taxable insurance proceeds 

table of contents fiscal compared with fiscal net sales net sales for fiscal decreased million  or  to  million from  million in fiscal the decrease is due to a million decrease in garden products and a million decrease in pet products 
the decreases in both garden products and pet products relate to reductions in sales of other manufacturers products resulting from facility closures in fiscal and  as well as the business closure of two customers during the fourth quarter of fiscal in fiscal  kal kan  a supplier of dog food  and arch chemical  a major pool chemical supplier  each terminated their relationships with us to distribute their products directly to retailers 
in fiscal  sales of kal kan products were approximately million  and sales of arch products were approximately million 
the reduced revenues from sales of other manufacturers products were partially offset by increases in sales of our own pet branded products and lawn and garden branded products 
contributing to these increases were increased consumer acceptance of new products  continued strength of methoprene sales  the introduction of several new products and upgraded packaging 
gross profit gross profit increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal pet products gross profit increased million  or  reflecting increased gross profit from sales of our own branded products and cost improvements  partially offset by decreased sales of other manufacturers products 
garden products gross profit increased million  or  reflecting increased sales of our own branded products  partially offset by the effects of lower sales of other manufacturers products 
another factor contributing to the increase in gross profit in for both pet products and garden products was inventory and inventory related book and grass seed write downs in fiscal of million 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to in fiscal from in fiscal  reflecting increases from to in pet products and from to in garden products 
the percentage improvement was principally due to higher sales of our own branded products  a favorable mix of sales  and reduced sales of other manufacturers products  which generally result in lower gross margins as compared to sales of our own branded products 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased from during fiscal to for fiscal a portion of the decrease was due to million in goodwill amortization incurred in fiscal  which did not occur in fiscal as we ceased amortizing goodwill upon the adoption of sfas no 
at the beginning of fiscal selling and delivery expenses decreased by million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal both pet products and garden products shared in the decrease  which was principally due to the overall decrease in sales of other manufacturers products 
included in fiscal selling and delivery expense was approximately million attributable to the closure of pet products branches and increased freight costs to service out of market customers transferred from garden products distribution centers closed in fiscal facilities expenses remained flat at million in both fiscal and increased facilities expenses at pet products  principally due to shutdown costs related to the kal kan termination  offset a decrease at garden products  due to the decreased number of sales and logistics centers 
warehouse and administrative expenses decreased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal garden products decreased million  pet products decreased million and corporate decreased million 
the reductions in garden products and pet products were largely due to the impact of facility closures as well as the elimination of costs associated with certain personnel 
table of contents reductions and bad debt write offs incurred in fiscal  which were at lower levels in fiscal the decrease at corporate related to the elimination of million of goodwill amortization in fiscal  upon our adoption of sfas no 
these decreases were partially offset by increased legal and litigation related expenses and insurance premium costs in fiscal other income other income increased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase was due primarily to million of life insurance proceeds  partially offset by million in charges related to the write off of goodwill associated with an unsuccessful equity method investment 
earnings from equity method investments were million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal interest expense net interest expense decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease is due to both lower average short term borrowings and lower average short term interest rates 
average short term borrowings for fiscal were million compared to million in fiscal the average short term interest rates for fiscal and were and  respectively 
income taxes our effective income tax rate  before the cumulative effect of accounting change  for fiscal was compared to an effective rate of in fiscal for fiscal  our marginal tax rate was 
the difference between the marginal tax rate and the effective tax rate is due primarily to non taxable insurance proceeds recorded in fiscal in fiscal  we recognized a tax benefit of million on a pre tax loss of million 
the low effective tax rate in fiscal resulted primarily from the inclusion of non deductible goodwill amortization  which ceased upon adoption of sfas no 
ebitda ebitda is a basis used by our chief operating decision makers to measure our operating results and to measure profitability and performance 
we also use ebitda in evaluating performance for executive compensation purposes and budgeting purposes 
ebitda is also an important measure used in our evaluation of acquisition candidates  and our experience is that targets we approach with transactions involving our stock rely extensively on ebitda 
we calculate ebitda as income from operations plus depreciation and amortization 
management believes ebitda is meaningful to investors because it provides analysis of operating results using the same measures used by our chief operating decision makers 
while ebitda is frequently used as a measure of operations and the ability to meet debt service requirements  it is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation 
consistent with our calculation in the past and with our current debt covenants  our calculation excludes other income 
ebitda should not be viewed by investors as an alternative to generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  measures of income as a measure of performance or to cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities as a measure of liquidity 
in addition  ebitda does not take into account capital expenditures or certain changes in assets and liabilities as well as interest and income taxes which can affect cash flows

table of contents goodwill in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
changed the accounting for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives from an amortization method to an impairment approach 
we will continue to amortize other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives 
amortization of goodwill  including goodwill recorded in prior business combinations  ceased upon the adoption of the standard  which we adopted for the fiscal year beginning september  as required by sfas no 
 we performed our goodwill impairment analysis in fiscal and recorded a non cash charge to write down goodwill in garden products by million million after tax and in pet products by million million after tax 
we also performed our annual goodwill impairment analysis on the first day of our fiscal and fourth quarters  using a valuation model based on estimated future operating results and cash flows 
these analyses indicated that no additional adjustments were required to the remaining goodwill balances 
for more information  see notes and of our consolidated financial statements 
the following financial information for fiscal is presented as if sfas no 
were adopted at the beginning of fiscal september  in thousands  except per share amounts reported net loss goodwill amortization  net of tax net income  as adjusted basic and diluted loss per share reported loss goodwill amortization adjusted income per share inflation the results of operations and financial condition are presented based upon historical cost 
while it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation  we believe that the effects of inflation on our operations have been immaterial 
weather and seasonality historically  our sales of lawn and garden products have been influenced by weather and climate conditions in the different markets we serve 
additionally  garden products business has historically been highly seasonal 
in fiscal  approximately of garden products net sales and of our total net sales occurred in the second and third fiscal quarters 
substantially all of garden products operating income is typically generated in this period  which has historically offset the operating loss incurred during the first fiscal quarter of the year 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our growth through a combination of bank borrowings  supplier credit  internally generated funds and sales of equity and debt securities to the public 
historically  our business has been seasonal and our working capital requirements and capital resources tracked closely to this seasonal pattern 
during the first fiscal quarter  accounts receivable reach their lowest level 
table of contents while inventory  accounts payable and short term borrowings begin to increase 
during the second fiscal quarter  receivables  accounts payable and short term borrowings begin to increase  reflecting the build up of inventory and related payables in anticipation of the peak lawn and garden selling season 
during the third fiscal quarter  inventory levels remain relatively constant while accounts receivable peak and short term borrowings start to decline as cash collections are received during the peak selling season 
during the fourth fiscal quarter  inventory levels are at their lowest  and accounts receivable and payables are substantially reduced through conversion of receivables to cash 
as a result of the reduction in sales of garden products manufactured by other parties as a percentage of overall sales  this seasonal pattern has become somewhat less significant 
we service two broad markets pet supplies and lawn and garden supplies 
our pet supplies businesses involve products that have a year round selling cycle with very little change quarter to quarter 
as a result  it is not necessary to carry large quantities of inventory to meet peak demands 
additionally  this level sales cycle eliminates the need for manufacturers to give extended credit terms to either distributors or retailers 
on the other hand  our lawn and garden businesses are highly seasonal with approximately of garden products aggregate sales occurring during the second and third fiscal quarters 
for many manufacturers of garden products  this seasonality requires them to move large quantities of their product well ahead of the peak selling periods 
to encourage distributors to carry large amounts of inventory  industry practice has been for manufacturers to give extended credit terms and or promotional discounts 
cash provided by operating activities decreased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to increased inventory and accounts receivable levels 
increased inventory levels were due primarily to increased grass seed inventories for several of our varieties in anticipation of rising costs in  the build up of inventory for a new product launch and carrying higher finished goods inventory at several of our companies to accommodate transitions to new facilities and minimize interruptions of the supply of our products 
the increase in accounts receivable levels was primarily the result of increased sales in the fourth quarter  including increased sales towards the end of the quarter to several of our larger customers to whom we offer extended payment terms 
net cash used in investing activities increased million primarily as a result of capital expenditures for phase i of our kaytee products capital expansion project and our acquisition of a equity interest in the em matson lawn and garden business 
net cash provided by financing activities increased million due to the net proceeds received from the issuance of million of senior subordinated notes in january  a million senior term loan in may and employee stock option exercises 
these proceeds were partially offset by the redemption of our million convertible subordinated notes in february  the repayment of the outstanding borrowings under our prior credit facilities  the payment of financing costs associated with our senior subordinated notes and senior term loan  and the repayment of substantially all of our other debt 
at september   our total debt was million versus million at september  net debt  total debt less cash and cash equivalents  decreased to million at september  versus million at september  fiscal year ended september  september  in thousands notes payable current portion of long term debt long term debt total debt less cash and cash equivalents net debt 
table of contents in january  we issued million of senior subordinated notes due the net proceeds of approximately million were used to redeem million of subordinated convertible notes due november we used the balance of the net proceeds  combined with additional borrowings under our prior line of credit with congress financial corporation western  to repay the outstanding borrowings under our pennington credit facility and two senior secured term loans of all glass 
in conjunction with these repayments  we terminated the pennington and all glass credit facilities 
in may  we closed a new million senior secured credit facility consisting of a five year million revolving credit facility and a six year million term loan 
interest on the term loan initially was based on a rate equal to libor plus or the prime rate plus  at our option 
in october  we reduced the pricing on the term loan by to libor or the prime rate plus  at our option 
interest on the revolving credit facility is based on a rate equal to prime plus a margin which fluctuates from to or libor plus a margin which fluctuates from to  determined quarterly based on consolidated total debt to consolidated ebitda for the most recent trailing month period 
this facility is secured by essentially all of our assets  contains certain financial covenants requiring maintenance of minimum levels of interest coverage and tangible net worth and maximum levels of senior debt to ebitda and total debt to ebitda  and restricts our ability to make treasury stock purchases and pay dividends 
we were in compliance with all financial covenants as of september  this facility also requires the lenders prior written consent to any material investments in or acquisitions of a business 
the new facility replaced our million asset based revolving credit facility 
a portion of the net proceeds from the million term loan were used to retire the outstanding debt under the asset based revolving credit facility 
the remaining net proceeds were used to retire other existing debt and  along with the amounts available under the million revolving credit facility  will provide capital for general corporate purposes  acquisitions and investments 
no balances were outstanding at september  under the million revolving credit facility and the remaining available borrowing capacity at september  was million 
the million difference represents outstanding letters of credit 
as a result of these refinancings  we have increased our financial flexibility by replacing our long term debt  putting in place a layer of medium term capital and increased our access to additional lenders 
we believe that this increased financial flexibility will allow us to more effectively pursue growth opportunities and potential acquisitions on a prudent basis 
the table below presents significant commercial credit facilities available to us and their associated expiration dates in millions maximum commercial commitments less than year years years total amount committed revolving line of credit with canadian imperial bank of commerce subsequent to the end of fiscal  we entered into a million pay floating interest rate swap effectively converting half of our million fixed rate percent senior subordinated notes to a floating rate of libor 
the table below presents our significant contractual cash obligations by fiscal year in millions 
contractual obligations fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal thereafter total revolving line of credit facilities long term debt operating leases purchase commitments total contractual cash obligations 
table of contents we believe that cash flows from operating activities  funds available under our credit facility  and arrangements with suppliers will be adequate to fund our presently anticipated working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
we anticipate that our capital expenditures will not exceed million for the next months 
subsequent to year end  we deposited approximately million into an escrow account in connection with an appeal in the scotts litigation 
the use of this cash is restricted from general corporate purposes 
see item legal proceedings scotts litigation 
as part of our growth strategy  we have engaged in acquisition discussions with a number of companies in the past  and we anticipate that we will continue to evaluate potential acquisition candidates 
if one or more potential acquisition opportunities  including those that would be material  become available in the near future  we may require additional external capital 
in addition  such acquisitions would subject us to the general risks associated with acquiring companies  particularly if the acquisitions are relatively large 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
this statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  the adoption of sfas no

in addition  sfas no 
amends the disclosure requirements of accounting principles board apb opinion no

fin elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor and clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of the guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the adoption of the disclosure and recognition and measurement provisions of fin  effective beginning december   did not have an impact on our financial statements

sfas no 
requires that the 
table of contents liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
sfas no 
also establishes that the liability should initially be measured and recorded at fair value 
accordingly  sfas no 
may affect the timing of recognizing future restructuring costs as well as the amounts recognized 
we will apply the provisions of sfas no

in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  that replaced sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas no 
requires that long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  including those of discontinued operations  be measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell  whether reported in continuing operations or in discontinued operations 
liabilities for discontinued operations will no longer include amounts for operating losses that have not yet been incurred 
sfas no 
also broadens the reporting of discontinued operations to include all components of an entity with operations that can be distinguished from the rest of the entity and that will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity in a disposal transaction 
we adopted sfas no 
for our fiscal year beginning september  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have an impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements 
estimates and assumptions include  but are not limited to  accounts receivable and inventory values  fixed asset lives  intangible asset values  deferred income taxes  self insurance accruals and the impact of contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the result of which forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
although not all inclusive  we believe that the following represent the more critical accounting policies  which are subject to estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts we record an allowance for credit losses and disputed balances resulting from customers inability to make required payments 
we estimate our allowance based on both specific identification and historical experience 
if the financial condition of our customers was to deteriorate  or we were not able to demonstrate the validity of amounts due  additional allowances may be required 
for more information  see note of our consolidated financial statements 
inventory inventory  which primarily consists of lawn and garden products and pet supplies finished goods  is stated at the lower of first in first out fifo cost or market 
cost includes certain indirect purchasing  merchandise handling and storage costs including certain salary and data processing costs incurred to acquire or manufacture inventory  costs to unload  process and put away shipments received to prepare them to be picked for orders  and certain overhead costs 
we compute the amount of such costs capitalized to inventory based on an estimate of costs related to the procurement and processing of inventory to prepare it for sale compared to total product purchases 
when necessary  we have reduced the carrying value of our inventory if market conditions indicate that we will not recover the carrying cost upon sale 
future downward changes in market conditions related to our products would result in an additional charge to income in the period in which such conditions occur 

table of contents goodwill as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  we recorded a million non cash impairment of our goodwill as of september   which was recorded as a cumulative effect of accounting change in fiscal we test the carrying value of our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis on the first day of our fourth quarter 
we use projected future operating results and cash flows of our reporting units to establish the fair value used in evaluating the carrying value of the associated goodwill 
if estimated future results of operations differed from those projections used by management  or if alternative valuation methodologies had been used in determining the reporting units fair value  the cumulative effect of accounting change charge may have been different than the amount we recorded 
future downward changes in the operating results of our reporting units may result in additional charges to income in the year which such conditions occur 
long lived assets we review our long lived assets for potential impairment based on a review of projected undiscounted cash flows associated with these assets 
long lived assets are included in impairment evaluations when events and circumstances exist that indicate the carrying amount of those assets may not be recoverable 
measurement of impairment losses for long lived assets that we expect to hold and use is based on the estimated fair value of the assets 
we have recorded asset impairment charges when the carrying value of certain assets was in excess of their fair value 
should market conditions or the assumptions used by us in determining the fair value of these assets change  or management change plans for usage of certain assets  additional charges to operations may be required in the period in which such conditions occur 
stock based compensation the company measures compensation expense for its employee stock based compensation plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by apb opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees  and has provided pro forma disclosures of the effect on net income and earnings per share as if the fair value based method provided for under sfas no 
had been applied in measuring compensation expense 
as required under sfas no 
 the pro forma effects of stock based compensation on net income and earnings per common share for employee stock options granted and employee stock purchase plan purchases have been estimated at the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model 
for purposes of pro forma disclosures which are included in note of our consolidated financial statements  the estimated fair value of the options and shares is amortized to pro forma net income over the options vesting period 
although different valuation methodologies are available  we have chosen the intrinsic value method to account for common stock incentive awards 
this accounting policy has been applied consistently for all years presented 
operating results would be affected if other alternatives were used 
information about the impact on operating results by using apb opinion is included in note of our consolidated financial statements 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
deferred income taxes result primarily from bad debt allowances  inventory write downs  depreciation and nondeductible reserves 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
if we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  any adjustment would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
for more information  see note of our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents accruals for self insurance self insurance accruals are made for certain claims associated with employee health care  workers compensation and general liability insurance 
these accruals include estimates based on historical losses and expected future development factors 
differences in estimates and assumptions could result in accrual requirements materially different from the calculated accruals 
commitments and contingencies as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we are involved in several significant legal matters as well as other matters incidental to our business  the disposition of which are not expected to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
we use our best estimates to determine the probable outcome and costs associated with the resolution of such matters 
these estimates are developed in consultation with outside counsel handling these matters and are based upon a combination of potential litigation and settlement strategies 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarter or annual period could be materially affected by adverse developments or changes in management s strategy related to these proceedings 
risk factors this form k contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of factors both in and out of our control  including the risks faced by us described below and elsewhere in this form k 
you should carefully consider the risks described below 
in addition  the risks described below are not the only ones facing us 
we have only described the risks we consider to be the most material 
however  there may be additional risks that are viewed by us as not material or are not presently known to us 
if any of the events described below were to occur  our business  prospects  financial condition and or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
when we say below that something could or will have a material adverse effect on us  we mean that it could or will have one or more of these effects 
in any such case  the price of our common stock could decline  and you could lose all or part of your investment in our company 
we may be adversely affected by trends in the retail industry 
with the growing trend towards retail trade consolidation  we are increasingly dependent upon key retailers whose bargaining strength is growing 
our business may be negatively affected by changes in the policies of our retailer customers  such as inventory destocking  limitations on access to shelf space  price demands and other conditions 
in addition  as a result of the desire of retailers to more closely manage inventory levels  there is a growing trend among retailers to make purchases on a just in time basis 
this requires us to shorten our lead time for production in certain cases and more closely anticipate demand  which could in the future require the carrying of additional inventories and increase our working capital and related financing requirement 
a significant deterioration in the financial condition of one of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our sales  profitability and cash flow 
for example  in fiscal  kmart and house home filed for bankruptcy and  as a result  we wrote off million in receivables 
we continually monitor and evaluate the credit status of our customers and attempt to adjust sales terms as appropriate 
despite these efforts  another bankruptcy filing by a key customer could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we depend on a few customers for a significant portion of our business 
wal mart  our largest customer  accounted for approximately of our net sales in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal in addition  although each accounted for less than of our net sales  
table of contents home depot  lowe s  petsmart and petco are also significant customers and  together with wal mart  accounted for approximately of our net sales in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the market shares of all of these key retailers have increased during the last several years and may continue to increase in future years 
the loss of  or significant adverse change in  our relationship with any of these key retailers could cause our net sales  income from operations and cash flow to decline 
the loss of  or reduction in  orders from any significant customer  losses arising from customer disputes regarding shipments  fees  merchandise condition or related matters  or our inability to collect accounts receivable from any major customer could reduce our income from operations and cash flow 
we cannot be certain that our product innovations and marketing successes will continue 
we believe that our past performance has been based upon  and our future success will depend upon  in part  our ability to continue to improve our existing products through product innovation and to develop  market and produce new products 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in the introduction  marketing and production of any new products or product innovations  or develop and introduce in a timely manner innovations to our existing products which satisfy customer needs or achieve market acceptance 
our failure to develop new products and introduce them successfully and in a timely manner could harm our ability to grow our business and could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
seeds and grains we use to produce bird feed and grass seed are commodity products subject to price volatility that has had  and could have  a negative impact on us 
our financial results depend to some extent on the cost of raw materials and our ability to pass along increases in these costs to our customers 
in particular  our pennington and kaytee subsidiaries are exposed to fluctuations in market prices for commodity seeds and grains used to produce bird feed and grass seed 
historically  market prices for commodity seeds and grains have fluctuated in response to a number of factors  including changes in united states government farm support programs  changes in international agricultural and trading policies and weather conditions during the growing and harvesting seasons 
for example  due to drought conditions in  we experienced significant increases in the costs of most grains and seeds purchased for production 
these cost increases had a negative impact on profitability of bird feed products in fiscal in the event of any increases in raw materials costs  we would be required to increase sales prices to avoid margin deterioration 
we cannot assure you as to the timing or extent of our ability to implement future price adjustments in the event of increased raw material costs or as to whether any price increases implemented by us may affect the volumes of future shipments 
in fiscal and  garden products was adversely affected by a worldwide oversupply of certain grass seeds brought on by a combination of weather issues and the bankruptcy sale of a competitor  generally poor economic conditions in agriculture  and cattle diseases that reduce demand for seed 
by close of fiscal  the grass seed market returned to more normal conditions whereby most varieties are in supply demand balance  yet certain varieties are in oversupply  and others may be in short supply 
to mitigate our exposure to changes in market prices  we enter into purchase contracts for grains  bird feed and grass seed to cover up to approximately one third of the purchase requirements for a selling season 
since these contracts cover only a portion of our purchase requirements  if market prices for grains increase  our cost of production would increase 
in contrast  if market prices for grains decrease because of a lack of demand  we may end up purchasing grains and seeds pursuant to the purchase contracts at prices above market 
competition in our industries may hinder our ability to execute our business strategy  achieve profitability  or maintain relationships with existing customers 
we operate in highly competitive industries 
we compete against numerous other companies  some of which are more established in their industries and have substantially greater revenue or resources than we do 

table of contents our products compete against national and regional products and private label products produced by various suppliers 
our largest competitor in pet supplies products is hartz mountain  and our largest competitor in lawn and garden products is the scotts company 
since its acquisition of the ortho line of lawn and garden products from pharmacia corporation formerly monsanto in  scotts dominant position in the lawn and garden industry has been a significant competitive disadvantage for garden products 
to compete effectively  among other things  we must maintain our relationships with key retailers  continually develop innovative new products that appeal to consumers  maintain strict quality standards  deliver products on a reliable basis at competitive prices  and effectively integrate acquired companies 
competition could cause lower sales volumes  price reductions  reduced profits or losses  or loss of market share 
our inability to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our acquisition strategy involves a number of risks 
we have completed numerous acquisitions since and intend to grow through the acquisition of additional companies 
we are regularly engaged in acquisition discussions with a number of companies and anticipate that one or more potential acquisition opportunities  including those that would be material  may become available in the near future 
if and when appropriate acquisition opportunities become available  we intend to pursue them actively 
further  acquisitions involve a number of special risks  including failure of the acquired business to achieve expected results  diversion of management s attention  failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business  additional financing  if necessary and available  could increase leverage  dilute equity  or both  the potential negative effect on our financial statements from the increase in goodwill and other intangibles  and the high cost and expenses of completing acquisitions and risks associated with unanticipated events or liabilities 
these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we expect to face competition for acquisition candidates  which may limit the number of opportunities and may lead to higher acquisition prices 
in fiscal  we wrote off million of goodwill related to previous acquisitions in accordance with sfas we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify  acquire  or manage profitably additional businesses or to integrate successfully any acquired businesses into our existing business without substantial costs  delays or other operational or financial difficulties 
in future acquisitions  we also could incur additional indebtedness or pay consideration in excess of fair value  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our lawn and garden sales are highly seasonal and subject to adverse weather  either of which could impact our cash flow and operating results 
because our lawn and garden products are used primarily in the spring and summer  garden products business is seasonal 
in fiscal  approximately of garden products net sales and of our total net 
table of contents sales occurred during our second and third fiscal quarters 
substantially all of garden products operating income and cash flow is generated in this period 
our working capital needs and our borrowings generally peak near the middle of our second fiscal quarter because we are generating fewer revenues while incurring expenses in preparation for the spring selling season 
if cash on hand and borrowings under our credit facilities are ever insufficient to meet our seasonal needs or if cash flow generated during the spring and summer is insufficient to repay our borrowings on a timely basis  this seasonality could have a material adverse effect on our business 
because demand for lawn and garden products is significantly influenced by weather  particularly weekend weather during the peak gardening season  our results of operations and cash flow could also be adversely affected by certain weather patterns such as unseasonably cool or warm temperatures  water shortages or floods 
during the last several years  our results of operations and cash flow were negatively affected by severe weather conditions in some parts of the united states 
our operating results and cash flow are susceptible to fluctuations 
we expect to continue to experience variability in our net sales  net income and cash flow on a quarterly basis 
factors that may contribute to this variability include weather conditions during peak gardening seasons and seasonality  shifts in demand for lawn and garden products  shifts in demand for pet products  changes in product mix  service levels and pricing by us and our competitors  the effect of acquisitions  including the costs of acquisitions that are not completed  and economic stability of retail customers 
these fluctuations could negatively impact our business and the market price of our common stock 
our success is dependent upon retaining key personnel 
our future performance is substantially dependent upon the continued services of william e 
brown  our chairman  glenn w 
novotny  our president and chief executive officer  and brooks m 
pennington iii  the president of our pennington subsidiary 
the loss of the services of any of these persons could have a material adverse effect upon us 
in addition  our future performance depends on our ability to attract and retain skilled employees 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our existing personnel or attract additional qualified employees in the future 
some of the products that we manufacture and distribute require governmental permits and also subject us to potential environmental liabilities 
many of the products that we manufacture and distribute are subject to regulation by federal  state and local authorities 
such regulations are often complex and are subject to change 
environmental regulations may affect us by restricting the manufacturing or use of our products or regulating their disposal 
regulatory or legislative changes may cause future increases in our operating costs or otherwise affect operations 
although we believe we are and have been in substantial compliance with such regulations and have internal guidelines on the handling and disposal of our products  there is no assurance that in the future we may not be adversely affected by such regulations or incur increased operating costs in complying with such regulations 
however  neither the compliance with regulatory requirements nor our environmental procedures can ensure that we will not be subject to claims for personal injury  property damages or governmental enforcement 
in addition  while we do not anticipate having to make  and historically have not had to make  significant capital expenditures to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations  due to the nature of our operations and the frequently changing nature of environmental compliance standards and technology  we cannot predict with any certainty that future material capital expenditures will not be required 

table of contents in addition to operational standards  environmental laws also impose obligations on various entities to clean up contaminated properties or to pay for the cost of such remediation  often upon parties that did not actually cause the contamination 
accordingly  we may become liable  either contractually or by operation of law  for remediation costs even if the contaminated property is not presently owned or operated by us  or if the contamination was caused by third parties during or prior to our ownership or operation of the property 
with our extensive acquisition history  we have acquired a number of manufacturing and distribution facilities 
given the nature of the past operations conducted by us and others at these properties  there can be no assurance that all potential instances of soil or groundwater contamination have been identified  even for those properties where an environmental site assessment has been conducted 
while we are not subject to any existing remediation obligations  future events  such as changes in existing laws or policies or their enforcement  or the discovery of currently unknown contamination  may give rise to future remediation liabilities that may be material

the products that we manufacture could expose us to product liability claims 
our business exposes us to potential product liability risks  which are inherent in the manufacture and distribution of certain of our products 
although we generally seek to insure against such risks  there can be no assurance that such coverage is adequate or that we will be able to maintain such insurance on acceptable terms 
a successful product liability claim in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on us and could prevent us from obtaining adequate product liability insurance in the future on commercially reasonable terms 
we have pending litigation which could adversely impact our operating results 
we are a party to certain legal proceedings  including the litigation between us and scotts and litigation arising from a fire which destroyed our phoenix  arizona facility 
we are currently unable to determine the total expense or possible loss  if any  that may ultimately be incurred in the resolution of our legal proceedings 
regardless of the ultimate outcome of our legal proceedings  they could result in significant diversion of time by our management 
the results of our pending legal proceedings  including any potential settlements  are uncertain and we cannot assure you that the outcome of these disputes will not adversely affect our operating results 
see item legal proceedings 
the holders of our class b stock  through their voting power  can greatly influence control of central 
as of december   william e 
brown  our chairman  controlled approximately of the voting power of our capital stock 
accordingly  he can effectively control all matters requiring stockholder approval  including the power to elect all of our directors 
holders of class b stock are entitled to the lesser of ten votes per share or of the total votes cast 
holders of common stock are entitled to one vote for each share owned 
the holders of class b stock have of the combined voting power  subject to the aforementioned voting restrictions 
holders of class b stock are likely to be able to elect all of our directors  control our management and policies and determine the outcome of any matter submitted to a vote of our stockholders  except to the extent that a class vote of the common stock is required by applicable law 
the disproportionate voting rights of our common stock and class b stock could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
such disproportionate voting rights may make us a less attractive target for a takeover than we otherwise might be  or render more difficult or discourage a merger proposal  a tender offer or a proxy contest  even if such actions were favored by our common stockholders 
accordingly  such disproportionate voting rights may deprive holders of common stock of an opportunity to sell their shares at a premium over prevailing market prices  since takeover bids frequently involve purchases of stock directly from stockholders at such a premium price

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to market risks  which include changes in us interest rates and commodity prices and  to a lesser extent  foreign exchange rates 
we do not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate risk 
the interest payable on our credit facility is based on variable interest rates and therefore affected by changes in market interest rates 
if interest rates on our variable rate debt had changed by compared to actual rates  interest expense would have increased or decreased by approximately million in fiscal and million in fiscal in addition  we have fixed income investments consisting of cash equivalents and short term investments in marketable debt securities  which are also affected by changes in market interest rates 
subsequent to year end  we entered into a million pay floating interest rate swap effectively converting of our million fixed rate senior subordinated notes due to a floating rate of libor 
commodity prices 
we are exposed to fluctuation in market prices for grains and grass seed 
to mitigate risk associated with increases in market prices and commodity availability  we enter into contracts for grains  bird feed and grass seed purchases 
such contracts are primarily entered into to ensure commodity availability to us in the future 
as of september   we had entered into fixed seed purchase commitments for fiscal totaling approximately million 
a change in the market price for grain and grass seed would have resulted in an additional pretax gain or loss of million related to the contracts outstanding as of september  as of september   we had entered into fixed seed purchase commitments for fiscal totaling approximately million 
a change in the market price for grain and grass seed would have resulted in an additional pretax gain or loss of million related to the contracts outstanding as of september  foreign currency risks 
to date  we have had minimal sales outside of the united states 
purchases made from foreign vendors are primarily made in us dollars 
therefore  we have only minimal exposure to foreign currency exchange risk 
we do not hedge against foreign currency risks and believe that foreign currency exchange risk is immaterial to our current business
