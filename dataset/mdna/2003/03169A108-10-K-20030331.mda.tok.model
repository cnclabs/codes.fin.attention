item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview our history our company was founded in as an externally managed real estate investment trust reit 
until  substantially all of our operations consisted of the acquisition of mortgage loans for investment purposes 
in mid  our board of directors and management determined that it was in the best interest of the stockholders to pursue a different strategy 
later that year  we formed amnet  a wholly owned subsidiary  to engage in mortgage banking activities 
amnet originates mortgage loans to prime credit quality borrowers secured by first trust deeds through a network of independent mortgage brokers 
it sells the loans that it originates to institutional purchasers 
in december  in connection with our new focus on developing a mortgage banking business  our management team negotiated the termination of its management contract with home asset management company  inc hamco 
prior to termination of the contract  we paid hamco management fees based on its reit portfolio and was reimbursed by hamco for substantially all of its employee compensation and occupancy expenses 
since termination of the contract  we no longer pay management fees and are responsible for all compensation and occupancy expenses related to our business 
effective january   we began reporting our financial results in two segments  the mortgage banking business and the mortgage asset portfolio business 
our mortgage banking operations have grown significantly in at the same time  the mortgage asset portfolio business has significantly declined as the mortgage loans in our portfolio have been prepaid over time and have not been replenished 
as a result  over the last half of  our mortgage banking revenue significantly exceeded our mortgage asset portfolio revenue 
for the year ended december   our mortgage banking segment produced approximately million in revenue while the mortgage asset portfolio business produced approximately million which does not include non operational income from a litigation settlement of million 
accordingly  our financial results presentation has been changed to better reflect our current principal operations  the mortgage banking business 
how we generate revenue we generate revenue in our mortgage banking business segment two principal ways interest income 
from the time we originate a loan until the time we sell the loan  we earn interest on the loan  which is paid by the borrower 
the interest that we earn is partially offset by the interest we pay under our warehouse credit facilities used to finance our mortgage originations 
gain on loan sales 
we sell the whole loans that we originate to institutional purchasers  on a servicing released basis for cash 
we record the difference between the sale price of loans that we have sold and our cost to originate the sold loans as gain on loan sales revenue 
we recognize revenue at the time that we complete the loan sale  which is generally when we receive loan sale proceeds from the purchaser 
we continue to generate revenue from our mortgage asset portfolio business  although we expect that revenues from this segment of our business will continue to decline 
we generate revenue on the interest we receive on the mortgage loans we hold for investment 
our primary expense is the interest we pay on borrowings used to fund our mortgage loan portfolio 
our highlights our operating results for were dominated by the following our mortgage banking segment funded approximately million in january of funding in december of was approximately million 
we had significant increases in revenue and expenses as the result of opening regional offices for mortgage loan production in the mortgage banking segment 
we sustained approximately million of derivative losses that were not offset by corresponding loan sale gains 
our profitability for was mainly the result of non operational income in the form of a litigation settlement of million in the second quarter 
due to its start up nature  our new mortgage banking segment reported losses during the first three quarters of amnet became profitable in the month of september and continued to be profitable in the fourth quarter of  when it generated million net profit 
for the same quarter  the mortgage asset portfolio business segment produced a loss of thousand 
we continued to channel our resources toward the expansion of the mortgage banking business while mortgage asset portfolio business bond collateral assets continued to decline as a result of prepayments 
critical accounting policies the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances 
we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable in the circumstances  however  actual results may differ significantly from these estimates and assumptions which could have a material impact on the carrying value of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet dates and our results of operations for the reporting periods 
our significant accounting policies and practices are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the estimates and assumptions that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  in that they require management s most subjective judgments  to form the basis for the accounting policies deemed to be most critical to our company 
these critical accounting policies include the following allowance for loan losses we maintain an allowance for loan losses at an amount which we believe is sufficient to provide adequate protection against losses in the bond collateral mortgage loans portfolio 
we periodically evaluate the adequacy of the allowance based on such factors as our past loan loss experience  known and inherent risks in the portfolio  adverse situations that have occurred that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  the estimated value of underlying collateral  and economic conditions 
we utilize information currently available to evaluate the allowance for loan losses  but the allowance for loan losses is subjective and may be adjusted in the future depending on changes in economic conditions or other factors 
during the time we hold bond collateral mortgage loans  we are subject to credit risks  including risks of borrower defaults  bankruptcies and special hazard losses that are not covered by standard hazard insurance such as those occurring from earthquakes or floods 
nearly all of our bond collateral mortgage loans were made to borrowers who do not necessarily qualify for loans from conventional mortgage lenders  which may lead to higher delinquency rates and or credit losses for and thus require high loan loss allowances 
although we have established an allowance for loan losses that we have reviewed with our audit committee and that we consider adequate  there can be no assurance that the established allowance for loan losses will be sufficient to offset losses on bond collateral mortgage loans in the future 
amortization of premiums on bond collateral  mortgage loans the portfolio of bond collateral mortgage loans was acquired on a servicing retained and servicing released basis  meaning in some instances we acquired both the mortgage loans and the rights to service them 
this strategy required us to pay a higher purchase price or premium for the mortgages 
premiums are amortized written off to income using the interest method  generally over their weighted average estimated lives considering anticipated prepayments 
if these mortgage loans prepay faster than originally projected  gaap requires us to write down the remaining capitalized premium amounts at a faster speed than was originally projected  which would decrease our current net interest income 
mortgage prepayments generally increase on our adjustable rate mortgages when fixed mortgage interest rates fall below the then current interest rates on outstanding adjustable rate mortgage loans 
prepayments on bond collateral mortgage loans are also affected by the terms and credit grades of the loans  conditions in the housing and financial markets and general economic conditions 
we have sought to minimize the effects on operations caused by faster than anticipated prepayment rates by lowering premiums paid to acquire mortgage loans and by purchasing mortgage loans with prepayment penalties 
those penalties typically expire two to five years from origination 
as of december   approximately of bond collateral mortgage loans had active prepayment penalty features 
most of the intermediate adjustable rate mortgages in the cmo fasit   a and segments of the portfolio have reached their first contractual interest rate adjustment increase and many prepayment penalties on these loans have expired  resulting in a higher probability of refinancing and principal prepayments 
we anticipate that prepayment rates on the segment of loans will increase as these predominately adjustable rate loans reach their initial adjustments 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve or maintain lower prepayment rates or that prepayment rates will not increase 
our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if prepayment levels increase significantly 
we currently employ a prepayment model to project loan prepayment activity based upon loan age  loan type and remaining prepayment penalty coverage at a loan level detail 
reasonableness tests are performed against past history  mortgage asset pool specific events  current economic outlook and loan age to verify the overall prepayment projection 
derivative and hedging activities prior to  we used interest rate cap agreements cap agreements for interest rate risk protection on bond collateral 
the cap agreements were purchased primarily to reduce our gap risk the timing difference or mis match between the repricing of interest rate sensitive assets and interest rate sensitive liabilities 
on january   we adopted sfas prior to adoption of sfas  we had designated the cap agreements as hedges to assure that we maintained a positive gap between the cost of borrowing and the yield on our bond collateral bond collateral mortgage loan portfolio and  accordingly  the cost of the cap agreements was amortized over the life of the cap agreements using the straight line method 
upon adoption of sfas  we determined that our cap agreements did not meet the hedging requirements of sfas and  accordingly  we recorded transition amounts associated with establishing the fair values of the cap agreements on the balance sheet as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  which increased our net loss by million 
our mortgage banking business  which began in the fourth quarter of  is subject to the risk of rising as well as falling mortgage interest rates between the time it commits to extend credit at fixed rates rate lock and the time it sells the mortgage loans 
to mitigate this risk  we purchase optional coverage in the form of puts and less frequently calls on financial instruments mortgage backed securities of varying terms  enter into forward commitments to sell mortgage loans  and commitments to extend credit at fixed rates 
the nature and quantity of these hedging transactions are determined based on various factors  including changes in interest rates that may impact the volume of loans actually closed versus the volume of loans anticipated to close 
our derivative financial activities did not meet the hedging criteria under sfas and  accordingly  are accounted for in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as trading securities 
to the extent that our estimates regarding various factors  including the expected volume of mortgage loan originations  differ from actual results  the company s financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
in our mortgage banking business we must make a determination of fair market value fmv for our hedging instruments derivatives  loan pipeline and loans held for sale lower of cost or market 
these fmv s are determined based on consistently applied methods which are accepted within the regulatory climate our company operates 
hedging instruments are marked to market according to similar or identical financial instruments available in the market place at the time of the mark 
the loan pipeline mark is determined by contacting our group of investors whom we normally sell loans to and deriving a value for those loans less a factor for loans which will not close loan fallout based on our history of loan fallout 
by accounting rules  we are not allowed to recognize any revenue from loan sales until a true sale has taken place 
however if these loans are stated at a value less than could be obtained by sale in the marketplace  the lower value must be used 
we adhere to this method of book valuation 
retained interest in securitization value is determined by present value of projected cash flow current forward interest rate curves and assumptions on prepayment rates 
it has been determined  that for book purposes at december  there is no value for our retained interest in a securitization 
recent accounting developments in january  the fasb issued fin  consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 
fin addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities  which have one or both of the following characteristics the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties  which is provided through other interests that will absorb some or all of the expected losses of the entity  and the equity investors lack an essential characteristic of a controlling financial interest 
we have not evaluated the effect this statement will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
we have evaluated the effect of this statement and have determined that it will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
results of operations compared to mortgage banking business our mortgage banking business began in the third quarter of comparisons between and have large differences as a result of limited operating activity in as compared to significant growth throughout specifically  we incurred approximately million of start up operating expenses in as compared to million in operating expenses in we had virtually no revenues in this segment in as compared to million gain on the sale of loans  net of derivative financial instruments and adjustments for the twelve month period ending december   amounted to million 
this represents new activity for the company  for the comparable period ending december   there was a thousand loss on the sale of loans 
amnet s increase in net gains on the sale of loans is the result of the increase in its loan production volume 
in  amnet recorded gain on sales of loans revenue totaling million on loan dispositions totaling billion 
this revenue was offset by a loss on the company s derivative financial instruments totaling million 
for the months ending december   amnet s gain on sale of loans of million is a combination of various account categories 
loan premiums of approximately million represent the price at which amnet sells the loans to investors in excess of the principal balance of loans sold 
fee income of approximately million represents various charges to brokers for services rendered  which are deferred and recognized as part of the gain on the sales of the loans 
gross gain and fee income are offset by capitalized deferred loan acquisition costs 
the largest deferred cost associated with loan production is broker fees and yield spread premiums totaling approximately million 
other deferred costs include i deferred origination costs  which are recognized at the time of loan sale  of approximately million and ii loan premiums repaid to investors premium recapture and loan loss reserve costs aggregating approximately million 
premium recapture expenses represent repayment of a portion of certain loan sale premiums to investors on previously sold loans which subsequently payoff within six months of loan sale 
net gains on the sale of loans of million for the twelve month period ending december  represents approximately basis points on loan sales of billion 
during the first eight months of  amnet incurred net losses on its derivative financial instruments totaling million 
a portion of these losses was offset by higher than expected gains on the sale of loans 
however  due to a variety of reasons  we estimate that approximately million of losses on treasury hedges during the second and third quarters were not offset by correspondingly larger than expected gains on loans sold 
until august  amnet had used primarily treasury futures and options to hedge its loan pipeline against declines in value caused by increases in market interest rates 
at that time  amnet sold or closed its position in substantially all of its remaining options on treasury futures 
in august  amnet began using forward sales of mortgage backed securities tba mbs as its primary hedging vehicle 
due to continual declines in yields on mortgages during september through december  amnet recorded net losses on derivative financial instruments of million during the last four months of  but had offsetting higher than expected gains on the sale of loans 
amnet recorded interest income of million for the twelve months ended december  amnet earns interest on a loan from the date the loan is funded until final disposition 
accordingly  interest income is a function of the volume of loans funded  the interest rate on the loans and the length of time the loans are held prior to sale 
to the extent amnet funds loans with borrowings under its warehouse facilities  it records interest expense based on the same factors 
interest expense for the period was million 
the resulting net interest income earned on loan inventories was million  representing basis points on loan production of billion 
expenses incurred in the mortgage banking business consist of employee compensation and benefits  office and occupancy expense and other operating expenses in aggregate referred to as operating expenses 
for the twelve month period ending december   operating expenses totaled million 
for the comparable period ending december   there was approximately million of expenses incurred 
the increase was due to the establishment and ongoing overhead of amnet s mortgage banking operations  which are comprised of regional loan production offices and headquarter operations 
for the twelve months ended december   expenses included approximately million in sales commissions  which represent expenses that vary in direct proportion with the volume of funded loans  or approximately basis points 
on billion in funded loans 
operating expenses that were not directly variable totaled million  or approximately basis points 
on billion in funded loans for overall basis point expenses which is a measurement of the cost per loan declined throughout the decline in the overall expense per loan is due to scale efficiencies and the fact that operating expenses for the twelve month period included one time start up costs 
interest rate movements are difficult to predict but it is recognized that interest rates on residential mortgages were historically low throughout in  while rates have continued to remain at historical lows  the total number of home purchase and refinancing transactions are declining  causing a significant overall contraction of the loan origination market 
our financial projections for  and the earnings guidance provided in our press release dated february   assume a significant contraction in the size of the market by the end of  and total funded loan volume of to billion 
during the fourth quarter of  we generated an average monthly funded loan volume of million 
despite an assumed mortgage market contraction  we do not expect our monthly loan fundings to decline significantly in due to initiatives to increase sales coverage and broker penetration in existing markets and planned expansion into new markets 
however  in formulating our financial projections and above noted earnings guidance  we do anticipate higher costs per loan and lower per loan revenues as a direct consequence of the expected market contraction 
we expect continued profitability quarter over quarter in our mortgage banking business 
mortgage asset portfolio business for the years ended december  and  we generated net income of approximately million and a net loss of million  respectively 
the net income in was mainly due to non operational income from the settlement of litigation for million 
the net loss in was due to several events  each of which had a significant impact 
these events include purchase of the management contract for million  adoption of sfas which resulted in a write down of cap agreements for approximately million  and transaction fees related to the management contract buyout of approximately million 
our decision to avoid portfolio acquisitions throughout and resulted in a continued decline in the size of bond collateral mortgage loan portfolio 
this decline resulted in a decrease in net interest income from the mortgage asset portfolio 
interest rates are one of the keys to our ability to show net income in this segment our business 
the weighted average interest rate from our bond collateral is at december  while the weighted average interest rate we pay is for the same period 
the difference represents income to us 
as our portfolio balances continue to decline  we find that a key expense item continues to be premium amortization and credit losses 
our portfolio has been declining in size rapidly as a result of borrowers refinancing their mortgages which necessitates writing off our premium at accelerated rates 
credit losses on collateral are not decreasing in proportion to the decline in our portfolio balances 
less credit worthy borrowers have difficulty procuring refinancing terms while those more credit worthy are able to find lower interest rates available and opt to payoff their loans before they are due prepayment 
therefore with less credit worthy borrowers remaining in our portfolio assets  events of default occur more frequently and necessitate a higher proportion of credit reserves 
most of the intermediate adjustable rate mortgages in the cmo fasit   a  and segments of the bond collateral mortgage loans portfolio have reached their first contractual interest rate adjustment and prepayment penalties clauses on the underlying pool of loans have expired or declined  resulting in a higher probability of refinancing principal prepayments 
there can be no assurance that prepayment rates will not increase 
our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if prepayment levels increase significantly 
during  other income decreased approximately million over the year ended december  from million to million primarily due to a decrease of approximately million in prepayment penalty income 
interest income from cash accounts decreased approximately thousand 
for the year ended december   total expenses decreased approximately million from million to million over the year ended december  during  our company incurred decreases in all of the major expense categories 
the primary decrease included the following interest expense decreased approximately million as a result of the approximate decrease of million in bond collateral  premium amortization decreased by approximately million  provision for loan losses decreased by approximately thousand  other operating expenses decreased approximately million mainly due to the one time payment in of the management contract buyout of million and related costs of million  and management fees decreased approximately million also as a result of the management contract buyout in premium amortization expense represents the amortization of purchase premiums paid for bond collateral mortgage loans acquired in excess of the par value of the loans

we held mortgage assets of approximately million as of december   comprised mainly of mortgage loans held as bond collateral 
subsidiaries of our company  american residential eagle and american residential eagle  hold these assets  of which approximately million and million  respectively  is pledged as collateral for long term debt bonds 
this compares to million as of december  this reduction is a result of prepayments due to favorable refinance rates and our decision not to replace these assets 
as previously discussed  we are deploying assets to fund mortgage origination activities mortgage banking business 
results of operations compared to without business segmentation for the years ended december  and  we generated a net loss of approximately million and million  respectively 
net loss per diluted share of common stock was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the net loss in was due to several events  each of which had a significant impact 
these events include purchase of the management contract for million  adoption of sfas which resulted in a write down of cap agreements for approximately million  transaction fees related to the management contract buyout of approximately million and start up operating losses of the amnet mortgage loan origination business of approximately million 
our decision to avoid portfolio acquisitions throughout and resulted in a continued decline in the size of bond collateral mortgage loan portfolio 
this decline also resulted in a decrease in interest income and operating cash flow 
the net loss in was in a large part due to an impairment loss on retained interest in a securitization and spread compression 
spread compression in was a result of a basis point increase in borrowing rates from in december of to in december of  which was not offset by a corresponding increase in asset yields 
the impairment loss was determined by comparing discounted future cash flows of the retained interest and comparing that amount to that recorded on the balance sheet 
the discounted future cash flows had been negatively impacted by higher than forecasted prepayment activity 
we held mortgage assets of approximately million as of december   comprised mainly of mortgage loans held as bond collateral 
subsidiaries of the company  american residential eagle and american residential eagle  hold these assets  of which approximately million and million  respectively  is pledged as collateral for long term debt bonds 
this compares to million as of december  this reduction is a result of prepayments due to favorable refinance rates and not replacing these assets 
as previously discussed  we deployed assets to fund loan origination activities mortgage banking business 
premium amortization expense represents the amortization of purchase premiums paid for bond collateral mortgage loans acquired in excess of the par value of the loans

equity in income from american residential holdings  inc holdings a taxable affiliate added to the decrease in other income by approximately thousand as holdings share of cmo income decreases  also due to prepayments 
for the year ended december   other operating expenses increased approximately million over the year ended december  during  we incurred transaction fees to complete the buy out of the management contract of approximately million and operating losses to start loan origination activity of approximately million 
the million payment to buy out the management contract was treated as a non recurring expense as it has no future economic benefit 
increased other operating expenses were partially offset by no impairment losses in compared to approximately million in  and reduced losses on sale of real estate owned by approximately thousand 
liquidity and capital resources general our current sources of liquidity primarily consist of the following borrowings under our warehouse and other credit facilities  revenues generated by our mortgage banking operating activities including interest  branch fees and loan sale proceeds  and excess interest spread and over collateralization step down payments related to the mortgage asset portfolio business  net of repayments to servicers for past principal and interest advances on completed real estate owned dispositions 
our primary cash requirements include funding our mortgage loan originations  interest expense under our warehouse facilities  operating expenses  including commissions  repayment of our borrowings  and maintaining restricted cash account  which includes amounts required to be held by certain of our correspondent investors that may not be used in our operations or as equity for other warehouse lines of credit  as well as amounts held in escrow for third parties 
as our mortgage banking operations have grown and our mortgage asset portfolio has declined  our cash flow from investment activities has continued to declined in amounts and materiality 
cash generated by and used in our operations during the year ended december   on a consolidated basis we generated a net positive cash flow of million 
this net positive number can be better understood by explaining the major components 
mortgage asset portfolio business cash flow from our mortgage asset portfolio  was positive at approximately million the mortgage asset portfolio business generates cash from interest and principal received from bond collateral and proceeds from the sale of real estate owned bond collateral 
the bond trustees master servicer offset this cash by paying interest and principal to bondholders  paying servicer and trustee fees  bond insurance premiums and reimbursing servicers for any advances made on real estate owned dispositions 
any excess cash flow is remitted to us from the bond trustees on a monthly basis 
there are various factors that affect this flow  such as market interest rate changes 
additionally  our bond agreement provisions  specify the requirements for over collateralization accounts 
if overcollateralization accounts are deficient  this can restrict our receipt of excess cash flow and be used instead by the bond trustee to pay down long term debt 
cash flow from the mortgage asset portfolio is expected to decline in due to a decline in the size of the portfolio  and potential increases in overcollateralization accounts 
proceeds from litigation settlements aggregated approximately million we received two one time settlements to settle claims related to a lawsuit filed in calendar year in connection with the purchase of the fasit portfolio 
administrative expenditures for our mortgage asset portfolio business aggregated approximately million administrative expenses allocated to our mortgage asset portfolio business included portfolio management payroll allocations of approximately thousand  general legal expenses of approximately million  professional and consulting fees of approximately thousand  director fees of thousand  and liability insurance of approximately thousand 
approximately thousand of legal and consulting expenses in  related to the buyout of the contract of our former manager completed in late and the proxy solicitation undertaken in mid  are not expected to reoccur in however  we do expect director fees and general legal and professional expenses to increase due to the implementation of various new corporate governance measures required by the sarbanes oxley act of purchases of treasury stock totaled thousand during we periodically purchase our common shares under a board authorized share repurchase program 
in  we purchased thousand shares at an approximate average cost of per share 
we anticipate share repurchases in mortgage banking business proceeds from borrowings under the subordinated debt facility were million in we entered into the subordinated debt facility in december borrowings under the agreement are due in december  however we have the option to extend the due date to december we expect to extend the due date into cash reserves utilized to fund loan inventories and maintain cash collateral accounts in our mortgage banking business was approximately million 
our warehouse line lending agreements allow us to borrow from to of par for each mortgage loan 
we pay an additional to of the loan principal amount in fees or yield spread premium to the mortgage brokers 
lastly  a small portion of our loan inventory is funded with equity capital 
we typically have cash invested totaling between to of the principal amount of loans held for sale  which is recouped when the loans are purchased by investors 
should we increase the amount of loan inventory  either by holding loans for longer periods  or due to increased loan funding volume  the cash reserves necessary to carry loan inventories will increase in direct proportion to the inventory held 
cash expenditures in excess of cash receipts in the mortgage banking business were approximately million for for the first eight months of  the mortgage banking business operated at a loss  reflecting its start up nature 
expenses and capital expenditures associated with the creation and expansion of our loan origination infrastructure were incurred with loan production and resultant revenues lagging expenses 
with loan funding volumes increasing steadily throughout the year  we reached profitability in the third quarter 
additionally  we incurred significant hedging losses in the second and third quarters which were not entirely offset by higher gains on the sale of loans 
we reorganized our hedging operations and changed our hedging strategy in august  resulting in significantly improved hedging performance 
since september  the mortgage banking business has been profitable and cash flow positive 
at the end of  the mortgage banking business had approximately million in accounts receivable associated with loan sale transactions  all of which was received in january our financial condition can be affected by turmoil in world markets  which could directly impact domestic liquidity 
as stated earlier  we intend to renew existing financing facilities  and seek new financing sources as the need arises 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to secure new short or long term financing or that financing will be available on favorable terms 
on a go forward basis  we anticipate our liquidity will be predominantly impacted by the mortgage banking activity that began in late specifically  we expect to originate million to billion per month of new mortgage loans and fund these originations with equity capital and warehouse facility borrowings 
we also expect to continue to engage in hedging transactions that may require cash investment to maintain or adjust hedged positions 
furthermore  we anticipate greater general and administrative costs associated with the operations of our mortgage banking business 
we intend to use cash reserves  borrowings under the warehouse facilities and the subordinated debt facility and cash flow generated by the mortgage asset portfolio  as well as cash flow generated from the origination and sale of mortgage loans  to fund our operations 
we are therefore dependent on significant levels of warehouse financing to help execute our mortgage banking strategy 
furthermore  we must originate minimum levels of loans to remain profitable 
see business risk factors in item short term debt as of december   short term debt consists of revolving credit lines warehouse facilities used to fund our lending activities 
as of december   mortgage loans held for sale were pledged as collateral for the warehouse facility 
the warehouse facility consists of borrowings of million with three financial institutions at december  our maximum borrowings combined  from these three financial institutions is million 
these borrowings typically advance of the par balances of the loans pledged as collateral 
such financing is currently provided primarily under i a day secured mortgage warehousing revolving credit agreement  dated as of november   the bank credit agreement and entered into by amnet  american residential investment trust and jpmorgan chase  ii a day secured mortgage warehousing revolving credit agreement  dated as of march   the ubs warburg agreement and entered into by amnet and ubs warburg real estate securities inc  iii a day secured mortgage warehousing revolving credit agreement  dated as of october   the countrywide agreement and entered into by amnet  american residential investment trust and countrywide 
these warehouse facilities are repaid as principal payments on mortgage loans are received  or as the mortgage loans are sold 
the agreements governing these facilities contain a number of covenants  including covenants based on tangible net worth  cash flows  net income  and liquidity of our company 
as of december  we are in compliance with these covenants 
our short term sources of liquidity also include a million renewable day senior subordinated secured revolving loan agreement between american residential investment trust and tcw crescent mezzanine llp on december  the subordinated debt facility 
the subordinated debt facility is secured by residual interest spread investment certificates on the segment of the bond mortgage loan portfolio 
there were million of borrowings outstanding under this agreement at december   which matured in february but was extended for one year 
long term debt non recourse mortgage backed notes our long term debt consists of non recourse mortgage backed notes  which are principally secured by bond collateral mortgage loans and bond collateral real estate owned 
obligations under the mortgage backed notes are payable solely from the proceeds from the bond collateral and are otherwise non recourse to our company 
the maturities of the mortgage backed notes are directly affected by the rate of principal repayments on the related bond collateral 
the notes are also subject to redemption according to the specific terms of the indentures pursuant to which they were issued 
as a result  the actual maturities are likely to occur earlier than the stated maturities 
the components of the long term debt at december   are summarized below dollars in thousands securitization a securitization securitization securitization securitization total long term debt long term debt      capitalized costs on long term debt total long term debt      weighted average financing rates rate lock commitments to borrowers and commitments to sell loans in the ordinary course of business  we have commitments to fund mortgages 
we enter into financial commitments with interest rate risks through the origination and sale of mortgage loans 
we must manage the potential loss exposure caused by fluctuations in interest rates 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit mortgage loan pipeline and mandatory forward commitments to sell loans 
the following is a summary of our pipeline of loans in process and mandatory forward commitments to sell loans at december  and dollars in thousands commitments to originate loans at set interest rate   commitments expected to close   forward sales of mortgage backed securities tba mbs  mandatory commitments to sell mortgage loans held for sale  for the purposes of hedging our interest rate exposure on commitment to originate loans  we make various assumptions to estimate those mortgage loans which will not close escrow fallout 
the rate of fallout is applied to the total pipeline of mortgage loans to arrive at the net exposure to interest rate changes in the market 
the loans expected to be closed are hedged utilizing forward sales of mortgage backed securities and options 
some of these commitments will ultimately be denied by our company or declined by the borrower  and therefore  the commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
lease and long term debt commitments in order to better understand our future obligations under our leases and long term debt agreements  the table below shows our expected future payments for these debt instruments 
payments due by period dollars in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years after years long term debt      operating leases    total      long term debt is in the form of bonds which are directly tied to bond collateral assets and are in the form of mortgage loans 
these assets have payment schedules associated with each loan but can be paid off by the borrower at any time 
our history of bond collateral reduction indicates that we can reasonably project that bond collateral will continue on a path of accelerated reduction 
by the terms of the long term debt agreements  a reduction in the bond collateral will also result in a reduction of long term debt 
therefore the above reductions in long term debt are based on our projections for reduction in bond collateral 
operating leases are for regional office locations around the continental united states of america 
based on these lease agreements  the amounts shown represent payments due within the time periods shown 
item a 
quantitative disclosures about market risk a primary market risk facing our company is interest rate risk  which is highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond the control of our control 
we attempt to manage this risk in our mortgage banking and mortgage asset portfolio businesses 
mortgage banking business interest rate risk rate lock commitments and mortgage loans held for sale loan pipeline are subject to market price fluctuation until committed for sale 
these fluctuations are primarily tied to changes in market interest rates and the relationship of short term rates to long term rates yield curve 
in order to mitigate this risk  a variety of financial derivative instruments including forward mandatory mortgage security sale tba mbs and options on tba mbs sales are utilized to hedge or mitigate market price fluctuations 
during the first three quarters of we used treasury options as hedging instruments  now we use tba s 
these hedge positions are continually adjusted based on routine and ongoing quantification of our risk  but hedges may or may not be fully successful in complete risk mitigation 
in particular  our capital markets personnel must make estimates of the percentage of rate lock commitments expected to close under different interest rate changes 
losses on the sale of mortgage loans or hedging activity could adversely impact results of operations and our financial position 
other risks our ability to generate gains on the sale of mortgages is largely dependent upon the continuation of correspondent investor programs offered by large institutions 
typically these institutions have mortgage banking operations with which we compete 
at any point in time an investor could discontinue our business relationship and therefore narrow the scope of our investor loan sale programs 
we attempt to mitigate this risk by selling our loans to several investors and are constantly trying to develop new business relationships 
the mortgage banking business has many companies competing for mortgage loan originations who are much larger and more experienced in the business 
we are presently in a business environment of unprecedented low interest rates and we have been fortunate to capture market share during a period historic high levels of mortgage loan activity 
as interest rates rise we will be need to be highly competitive against these larger more experienced companies 
we will mitigate this risk by being a niche market participant dealing exclusively with loan brokers and providing a higher level of person service than our competitors 
mortgage asset portfolio business interest rate risk our operating results for this business segment will depend in large part on differences between the income from our assets net of credit losses and our borrowing costs 
all of this business segment s mortgage assets are pledged as collateral for long term debt securitizations 
in most cases  the income from assets will respond more slowly to interest rate fluctuations than the cost of borrowings  which creates a mismatch between asset yields and borrowing rates 
consequently  changes in interest rates  particularly short term interest rates  may influence the mortgage asset portfolio business net income 
long term debt interest rates are tied to libor 
increases in these rates will tend to decrease net income 
a significant increase in short term interest rates  where the one month libor exceeded could  result in interest expense exceeding interest income would result in operating losses 
in the past  we have attempted to mitigate interest rate gap risk through hedging instruments called interest rate caps 
the majority of mortgages held in the portfolio are adjustable rate mortgages arm s which adjust every six months 
consequently our gap risk is limited and at the present time we do not believe that the cost of hedging our gap risk is justified 
currently we do not have any interest rate caps in place 
other risks the value of mortgage portfolio assets may be affected by prepayment rates on bond collateral mortgage loans 
prepayment rates are influenced by changes in current interest rates and a variety of economic  geographic and other factors beyond our control 
partial protection comes in the form of prepayment penalties but since our portfolio is becoming more mature  most of the prepayment penalty clauses have expired 
increases in delinquency rates and defaults by borrower on their mortgages can also negatively impact the financial results of the mortgage asset portfolio business 
we monitor delinquencies and defaults and adjust the loan loss provision and interest reserves accordingly 
sensitivity analyses we have performed various sensitivity analyses that quantify the net financial impact of changes in interest rates on our interest rate sensitive assets  liabilities and commitments 
these analyses presume an instantaneous parallel shift of the yield curve 
various techniques are employed to value the underlying financial instruments and rely upon a number of critical assumptions 
the scenarios presented are illustrative 
actual experience may differ materially from the estimated amounts presented for each scenario 
to the extent that yield curve shifts are non parallel and to the extent that actual variations in significant assumptions differ from those applied for purposes of the valuations  the resultant valuations can also be expected to vary 
such variances may prove material

consequently  the preceding estimates should not be viewed as a forecast
