item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the policies described below represent those that are broadly applicable to its operations and involve additional management judgment due to the sensitivity of the methods  assumptions and estimates necessary in determining the related amounts 
accounts receivable 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers  third party and vendor receivables and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
property  plant and equipment 
management must use its judgment in the selection of estimated useful lives and salvage values for purposes of depreciating tractors and trailers which do not have guaranteed residual values 
estimates of salvage value at the expected date of trade in or sale are based on the expected market values of equipment at the time of disposal 
self insurance 
the company is self insured for health and workers compensation benefits up to certain stop loss limits 
such costs are accrued based on known claims and an estimate of incurred  but not reported ibnr claims 
ibnr claims are estimated using historical lag information and other data provided by claims administrators 
this estimation process is subjective  and to the extent that future actual results differ from original estimates  adjustments to recorded accruals may be necessary 
revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized in full upon completion of delivery to the receivers location 
for freight in transit at the end of a reporting period  the company recognizes revenue prorata based on relative transit miles completed as a portion of the estimated total transit miles with estimated expenses recognized upon recognition of the related revenue 
prepaid tires 
tires purchased with revenue equipment are capitalized as a cost of the related equipment 
replacement tires are included in prepaid expenses and deposits and are amortized over a month period 
substantially all tires are recapped with the cost of recapping expensed when incurred 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage relationship of revenue and expense items to operating revenues for the periods indicated 
years ended december  operating revenues operating expenses salaries  wages and benefits operating supplies rent and purchased transportation depreciation and amortization operating taxes and licenses insurance and claims communications and utilities other gain loss on sale or disposal of property total operating expenses operating income interest expense income before income taxes federal and state income taxes net income compared to for the year ended december   our revenues were million as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was due to improved utilization of existing revenue equipment and an increase in the average number of tractors from  in to  in improved utilization of existing revenue equipment resulted in a increase in average revenue generated per tractor each work day from in to in salaries  wages and benefits decreased from of revenues in to of revenues in while total salaries and wages costs did increase during  the increase in revenues caused these costs to continue at approximately the same percentage of revenue 
the decrease  as a percent of revenues  relates to a decrease in the amount reserved for employee health claims incurred but not reported 
rent and purchased transportation decreased from of revenues in to of revenues in the decrease relates primarily to a decrease in amounts paid to other transportation companies in the form of brokerage fees thereby resulting in a shift of costs for driver wages  fuel and equipment costs  although to a lesser extent  to the company s other operating expense categories 
depreciation and amortization increased from of revenues in to of revenues in the increase was primarily due to the combined effect of higher purchase prices for new equipment and lower guaranteed residual values offered by the manufacturer 
insurance and claims increased from of revenues in to of revenues in the increase relates primarily to an increase in rates for auto liability insurance coverage 
other expenses decreased from of revenues in to of revenues in the decrease relates primarily to the expiration of non compete agreements with certain employees of a previously acquired company 
interest expense decreased from of revenues in to of revenues in due to a decrease in interest rates and to the repayment of debt as discussed in the liquidity and capital resources section of this report 
our effective tax rate remained constant at during and  however  increased net income resulted in an increase in the provision for income taxes from million in to million in net income increased to million  or of revenues  in from million  or of revenues in  representing an increase in diluted net income per share to in from in compared to for the year ended december   our revenues were million as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase relates primarily to an increase in the average number of tractors  from  in to  in  and an increase in our utilization revenue per tractor per work day  which increased  from in to in operating supplies and expenses increased from of revenues in to of revenues in the increase relates to an increase in fuel costs of of revenues  net of a fuel surcharge passed to customers  and an increase of of revenues in equipment repair costs 
rent and purchased transportation decreased from of revenues in to of revenues in the decrease relates primarily to a decrease in amounts paid to other transportation companies in the form of brokerage fees 
insurance and claims increased from of revenues in to of revenues in the increase relates primarily to an increase in rates for auto liability insurance coverage 
loss on sale or disposal of property increased from of revenues in to of revenues in this increase is primarily the result of a one time write down in the amount of  net of tax  of the value of the tractors and trailers that we acquired in the decker transport co 
inc acquisition  which  unlike the rest of our tractors  do not have guaranteed residual resale or trade in values 
our effective tax rate increased from in to in  which  combined with increased revenues  resulted in an increase in the provision for income taxes from million in to million in net income increased to million  or of revenues  in from million  or of revenues in  representing an increase in diluted net income per share to in from in quarterly results of operations the following table presents selected consolidated financial information for each of our last eight fiscal quarters through december  the information has been derived from unaudited consolidated financial statements that  in the opinion of management  reflect all adjustments  consisting of normal recurring adjustments  necessary for a fair presentation of the quarterly information

investing activities used million in cash during compared to million and million in and  respectively 
the cash used in all three years related primarily to the purchase of revenue equipment tractors and trailers used in our operations 
financing activities generated million in cash during compared to cash generated by financing activities of million in and cash used in financing activities of million in in all three years  the cash used in financing activities was primarily for repayment of long term borrowings incurred to finance the purchase of revenue equipment used in our operations 
see cash flow statement on page our primary use of funds is for the purchase of revenue equipment 
we typically use our existing lines of credit on an interim basis  in addition to cash flows from operations  to finance capital expenditures and repay long term debt 
during and  we utilized cash on hand and our lines of credit to finance revenue equipment purchases for an aggregate of million and million  respectively 
occasionally we finance the acquisition of revenue equipment through installment notes with fixed interest rates and terms ranging from to months 
at december   we had outstanding indebtedness under such installment notes of million 
as of february   we had approximately  in outstanding indebtedness under such installment notes  with various maturity dates through february the weighted average interest rates on these installment notes were  and for  and  respectively 
we maintain two million revolving lines of credit line a and line b with separate financial institutions 
amounts outstanding under line a bear interest at libor determined as of the first day of each month plus  are secured by our accounts receivable and mature on may  at december   million in letters of credit were outstanding under line a  with availability to borrow million 
amounts outstanding under line b bear interest at libor on the last day of the previous month plus  are secured by revenue equipment and mature on november  at december   line b was fully utilized with million outstanding 
in an effort to reduce interest rate risk associated with these floating rate facilities  we have entered into interest rate swap agreements in an aggregate notional amount of million 
for additional information regarding the interest rate swap agreements  see item a of this report 
during march and april  the company received net proceeds of approximately million from a public offering of  shares of its common stock 
the company repaid approximately million of long term debt obligations with the proceeds and intends to use the remaining proceeds to fund its capital expenditures and to finance general working capital needs 
our cash flows from operations increased to million in compared to million in this is due to an increase in cash provided by the excess of cash revenues over cash expenses and management of accounts payable offset by an increase in accounts receivable 
the purchase of property and equipment in required less cash than was required for those purchases in the proceeds of the issuance of common stock provided million which was used primarily to reduce outstanding debt 
common stock proceeds in excess of debt reductions was retained at december   for future corporate purposes 
for  we expect to purchase approximately new tractors and approximately trailers while continuing to sell or trade older equipment  which we expect to result in net capital expenditures of approximately million 
we are also in the process of expanding our corporate headquarters at our main facility in tontitown  arkansas  which we expect to finance from cash on hand 
on january   the company closed the purchase of substantially all of the assets of east coast transport and logistics  inc  a freight brokerage operation based in new jersey 
in connection with this acquisition  the company issued to the seller an installment note in the amount of approximately million at an interest rate of and paid cash of approximately million utilizing existing cash 
on february   the company entered into a non binding letter of intent to purchase for cash certain assets of mcneill trucking company  inc  a truckload carrier based in little rock  arkansas 
consummation of the transaction is subject to the satisfactory completion of a due diligence investigation  negotiation of a definitive agreement and any required regulatory approvals 
regardless of whether we consummate the proposed acquisition of mcneill trucking company  inc  we expect that our working capital and available credit under our credit lines will be sufficient to meet our capital commitments and fund our operating needs for at least the next twelve months 
insurance with respect to physical damage for tractors  cargo loss and auto liability  the company maintains insurance coverage to protect it from certain business risks 
these policies are with various carriers and have per occurrence deductibles of   and  respectively 
the company elected in to self insure itself for physical damage to trailers 
during  the company changed its workers compensation coverage in arkansas  oklahoma  mississippi and florida from a fully insured first dollar policy to a fully insured policy with a  per occurrence deductible 
the company continues to be self insured for workers compensation claims in the state of ohio with a  self insured retention with excess insurance 
the company has reserved for estimated losses to pay such claims as well as claims incurred but not yet reported 
the company has not experienced any adverse trends involving differences in claims experienced versus claims estimates for workers compensation claims 
letters of credit aggregating  are held by a bank as security for workers compensation claims and letters of credit aggregating  are held by a bank for auto liability claims 
the company self insures for employee health claims with a stop loss of  per covered employee per year and estimates its liability for claims incurred but not reported 
seasonality our revenues do not exhibit a significant seasonal pattern  due primarily to our varied customer mix 
operating expenses can be somewhat higher in the winter months  primarily due to decreased fuel efficiency and increased maintenance costs associated with inclement weather 
in addition  the automobile plants for which we transport a large amount of freight typically utilize scheduled shutdowns of two weeks in july and one week in december and the volume of freight we ship is reduced during such scheduled plant shutdowns 
inflation inflation has an impact on most of our operating costs 
recently  the effect of inflation has been minimal 
competition for drivers has increased in recent years  leading to increased labor costs 
while increases in fuel and driver costs affect our operating costs  we do not believe that the effects of such increases are greater for us than for other trucking concerns 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our primary market risk exposures include commodity price risk the price paid to obtain diesel fuel for our tractors and interest rate risk 
the potential adverse impact of these risks and the general strategies we employ to manage such risks are discussed below 
the following sensitivity analyses do not consider the effects that an adverse change may have on the overall economy nor do they consider additional actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to such changes 
actual results of changes in prices or rates may differ materially from the hypothetical results described below 
commodity price risk prices and availability of all petroleum products are subject to political  economic and market factors that are generally outside of our control 
accordingly  the price and availability of diesel fuel  as well as other petroleum products  can be unpredictable 
because our operations are dependent upon diesel fuel  significant increases in diesel fuel costs could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
for and  fuel expenses represented and  respectively  of our total operating expenses 
based upon our fuel consumption  a increase in the average annual price per gallon of diesel fuel would increase our annual fuel expenses by million 
in august and july  we entered into agreements to obtain price protection and reduce a portion of our exposure to fuel price fluctuations 
under these agreements  we were obligated to purchase minimum amounts of diesel fuel per month  with a price protection component  for the six month periods ended march  and february  the agreements also provide that if during the months commencing april  the price of heating oil on the new york mercantile exchange ny mx ho falls below 
per gallon  we are obligated to pay  for a maximum of twelve different months selected by the contract holder during such month period  the difference between 
per gallon and ny mx ho average price  multiplied by  gallons 
accordingly  in any month in which the holder exercises such right  we would be obligated to pay the holder  for each cent by which 
exceeds the average ny mx ho price for that month 
for example  the ny mx ho average price during february was approximately  and if the holder were to exercise its payment right  we would be obligated to pay the holder approximately  in addition  if during any month in the twelve month period commencing january  the average ny mx ho is below 
per gallon  we will be obligated to pay the contract holder the difference between 
and the average ny mx ho price for such month  multiplied by  gallons 
the agreements are stated at their fair value of  which is included in accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
interest rate risk our two million lines of credit each bear interest at a floating rate equal to libor plus a fixed percentage 
accordingly  changes in libor  which are effected by changes in interest rates generally  will affect the interest rate on  and therefore our costs under  the lines of credit 
in an effort to manage the risks associated with changing interest rates  we entered into interest rate swap agreements effective february  and may   on notional amounts of  and  respectively 
the pay fixed rates under the  and  swap agreements are and  respectively 
the receive floating rate for both swap agreements is month libor 
these interest rate swap agreements terminate on march  and june   respectively 
assuming million of variable rate debt was outstanding under each of line a and line b for a full fiscal year  a hypothetical basis point increase in libor would result in approximately  of additional interest expense  net of the effect of the swap agreements 
for additional information with respect to the interest rate swap agreements  see note to our consolidated financial statements
