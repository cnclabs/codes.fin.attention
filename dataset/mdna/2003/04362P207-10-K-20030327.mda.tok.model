the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview headquartered in westborough  massachusetts since july  ascential software corporation is a leading supplier of enterprise integration solutions to the global and other large organizations 
we believe that our enterprise integration suite  built upon a highly scalable platform  is the industry s only 
table of contents solution that is intended to address the full data integration life cycle  and turns corporate data into intelligent information information that is reliable  relevant  and complete so organizations can make better informed business decisions and drive their strategic application initiatives 
our products for automated data profiling  data quality management and cleansing  and data extraction  transformation  and loading are built on an enterprise integration platform of core integration services that are intended to provide end to end meta data management for a clear  unambiguous definition and history of the data used to drive strategic enterprise applications 
we also provide connectivity between virtually any data source and application and virtually unlimited scalability to manage the massive volumes of corporate data generated through high performance processing through the platform 
this complete offering is called the enterprise integration suite and is currently  we believe  the only platform of its type available from a single vendor 
we also offer a full range of consulting  educational and support services to assist customers through all phases of a project 
based on proven methodologies  these services represent years of accumulated intellectual capital in terms of knowledge and experience  gained through many successful engagements across a range of industries and enterprise application requirements 
we support more than  customers in such industries as telecommunications  insurance  financial services  healthcare life sciences  manufacturing  consumer goods  and retail 
we had employees as of december  we were incorporated in delaware in and  until the third quarter of  operated under the name informix corporation 
effective january   we consolidated our business units into two operating segments informix software  which operated our database software systems business  and ascential software  which operated our extract  transform and load etl and digital asset management software and solutions business 
during the third quarter of  we completed the sale of the assets of our database business  including the name informix  to ibm for billion in cash  which we refer to as the ibm transaction see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in connection with the ibm transaction  we changed our name to ascential software corporation and changed the symbol under which our stock is traded on the nasdaq national market to ascl 
these changes became effective in july during  after the sale of the assets of our database business  our sole operating segment has been our ascential software business  however we continue to incur costs associated with the termination of our database business 
barring unforeseen circumstances  costs associated with the termination of our database business are expected to decrease throughout the year ended december  to a relatively insignificant amount 
enterprises are faced with managing the exploding growth of data and gaining a more accurate view of the factors that impact their performance 
enterprises are also coping with the requirement to access data from an increasing number of disparate sources of data which frequently contain incomplete  inaccurate  inconsistent or duplicate information 
we believe these organizations want to be able to use the data efficiently and effectively to increase their revenue and market share  decrease operating costs and improve asset utilization 
our overall business strategy is to establish ascential software corporation as the leader in the enterprise integration market by delivering what we believe is the industry s most comprehensive data integration product solution by continuing to expand our product offerings through internal development and strategic technology and business acquisitions 
we are focused on accelerating revenue growth by leveraging our large customer base and the completeness of our enterprise data integration offerings  and by expanding our worldwide distribution through partnerships with recognized industry leaders 
we also intend to use our global professional services organization to accelerate the adoption of our product offerings and provide a variety of value added services to our existing customers 
we have targeted a revenue mix of to from licenses with the balance from services 
we use a number of key financial metrics internally to track our progress against these objectives 
we measure our progress against achieving increased market penetration by the number of new customers signed each quarter  the number of fortune companies that are our customers  and the amount of additional revenue generated from our existing installed base 
we monitor the success of our strategic partners 
table of contents by reviewing the revenue generated from these relationships and the number of license deals and revenue generated or influenced by partners on a quarterly basis 
in order to ensure that spending is consistently monitored and resources are used appropriately  we track headcount and spending monthly 
we regularly review all relevant margin metrics  including license margins  maintenance margins  professional service margins  total service margins and operating margins 
lastly  in order to ensure that cash flow is maximized and to identify customer payment issues on a timely basis  we closely monitor cash collections and accounts receivable days sales outstanding dso 
on january   our board of directors endorsed the decision to divest our content management product line because it did not align with our strategic goals 
we engaged an investment bank to assist in the divestiture process and sought potential buyers for the product line during the six months ended june  in june  we ceased efforts to find a buyer for the product line as no interested buyers were identified and terminated the related operations  except for the completion of previously committed consulting and support contracts 
as a result  in june we recorded a charge totaling million consisting of million charged to cost of software for the impairment of software costs previously capitalized and million charged to merger  realignment and other charges for severance costs  computer equipment impairment costs and professional fees incurred in connection with efforts to sell the product line 
barring unforeseen circumstances  we expect to incur a relatively insignificant net loss from the content management product line during the year ended december   as we fulfill remaining contractual customer support obligations 
on april   we acquired vality technology incorporated vality for million  consisting of million paid to acquire outstanding stock and vested stock options net of million of cash acquired from vality  and million for transaction costs 
vality  headquartered in boston  massachusetts  was a privately held company that specialized in enterprise data quality management 
concurrent with the acquisition  we awarded million shares of restricted stock to vality s former chief executive officer 
on may   vality s former chief executive officer left our company and his shares became fully vested  resulting in a million charge for non cash compensation recorded to merger  realignment  and other charges in the year ended december  in connection with the acquisition of vality  we also recorded a charge of million for the write off of in process research and development 
vality s products have been integrated into our enterprise integration suite 
products and services our products are designed to operate as part of our enterprise integration suite  or as stand alone integration components 
our product functionality includes automated data profiling to analyze and manage source data content and structure  data quality and cleansing to identify  correct and reconcile inaccurate or redundant data  and data extraction  transformation and loading to obtain data from a source  format it as required  and deliver it to a specified target 
our products are supported by a comprehensive platform of integration services that deliver end to end meta data management  connectivity between virtually any standard data source and application  and virtually unlimited scalability and performance 
this combination of integration products built on a platform of integration services forms our enterprise integration suite 
our enterprise integration suite offers a comprehensive  modular solution that can expand with business needs or as customer budgets dictate 
our customers can deploy the complete enterprise integration suite to address the entire enterprise integration life cycle  or use individual integration products as needed in support of more limited scope implementation requirements 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates 
table of contents its estimates and judgments  including those relating to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  accounting for software development costs  goodwill and intangible assets  income taxes and merger realignment and other charges 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the timing and amount of revenue recognized and the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition revenue consists principally of fees for licenses of the company s software products  maintenance  consulting  and training 
as part of the revenue recognition process  significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used to determine the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
we recognize revenue using the residual method in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
under the residual method  revenue is recognized in a multiple element arrangement in which company specific objective evidence of fair value exists for all of the undelivered elements in the arrangement  but does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements in the arrangement 
company specific objective evidence of fair value of maintenance and other services is based on our customary pricing for such maintenance and or services when sold separately 
we have analyzed all of the elements included in our multiple element arrangements and believe that we have sufficient company specific objective evidence to allocate revenue to the maintenance services and professional services components of our license arrangements 
we sell our professional services separately  generally  on a time and materials basis and at times without a software license  and we have established company specific objective evidence on this basis 
company specific objective evidence for maintenance is determined based upon either renewal rates when maintenance is sold separately or the option price for annual maintenance renewals included in the underlying customer contract 
at the outset of the arrangement with the customer  we defer revenue for the fair value of any undelivered elements eg  maintenance  consulting  and training and recognize revenue for the remainder of the arrangement fee attributable to the elements initially delivered in the arrangement ie  software product when the basic criteria in sop have been met 
if such evidence of fair value for each element of the arrangement does not exist  all revenue from the arrangement is deferred until such time that evidence of fair value does exist or until all elements of the arrangement are delivered 
changes to the elements of a software arrangement  the ability to identify company specific objective evidence and the ability to measure the fair value of the respective elements could materially impact the amount of earned and deferred revenue 
under sop  revenue attributable to an element in a customer arrangement is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  collection of the resulting receivable is probable  and the arrangement does not require services that are essential to the functionality of the software 
our ability to estimate if the collection of the resulting receivable is probable could materially impact the amount of revenue we record 
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
for our license arrangements with end users  our customary practice is to have a signed written agreement or  in some cases  either a click wrap or shrink wrap license 
existing customers with a license agreement in place may purchase additional products through a purchase order governed by the license agreement 
sales to most of our resellers are evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship together with purchase orders on a transaction by transaction basis 
delivery has occurred 
our software may be either physically or electronically delivered to the customer 
delivery is deemed to have occurred upon the shipment of physical product  provided title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  or upon online availability of product to the customer 
if undelivered products or services exist in an arrangement that are essential to the functionality of the delivered product  
table of contents delivery is not considered to have occurred until these products or services are delivered 
in the case of arrangements with resellers  revenue is generally recognized upon sell through 
evidence of sell through may take a variety of forms  including the following a purchase order identifying an end user customer  usually in the ship to location  a copy of the purchase order or contract between reseller and end user  a royalty report from the reseller  a sell through report  or other documented  objective evidence that indicates that the reseller does not have product in inventory  such as ending inventory reports 
the fee is fixed or determinable 
we consider a fee fixed only if it is required to be paid at a set amount  it is not subject to refund or adjustment  and payments are due on a known or fixed schedule 
we generally consider arrangements with payment terms extending beyond one year not to be fixed and determinable 
if the fee is not fixed and determinable  we recognize revenue as payments become due from the customer 
amounts received from customers in advance of revenue being recognized are recorded as a liability as a component of deferred revenue in our financial statements 
collectibility is probable 
collectibility is assessed on a customer by customer basis 
prior to the ibm transaction  we frequently sold to customers for whom we had a history of successful collection 
subsequent to the ibm transaction  a portion of our business is generated from new customers which are subjected to a credit review process that evaluates each customer s financial position and ultimately their ability to pay 
if it is determined from the outset of an arrangement that collectibility is not probable based upon our credit review process  revenue is recognized only as cash is collected 
functionality of the software 
our professional services generally are not essential to the functionality of the software 
our software products are fully functional upon delivery and implementation and do not require any significant modification or alteration 
customers purchase these professional services to facilitate the adoption of our technology and dedicate personnel to participate in the services being performed  but they may also decide to use their own resources or appoint other professional service organizations to provide these services 
software products are billed separately and independently from professional services  which are generally billed on a time and materials or milestone achieved basis 
we generally recognize revenue from professional services as the services are performed 
if consulting services are essential to the functionality of the licensed software  then both the license revenue and the consulting service revenue are recognized under either the percentage of completion or the completed contract method of contract accounting 
our arrangements do not generally include acceptance clauses 
however  if an arrangement includes an acceptance provision  acceptance occurs upon the earlier of receipt of a written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
our arrangements do not generally provide for a right of return  and historically product returns have not been significant 
we provide for sales return allowances on an estimated basis 
deferred revenue includes amounts received from customers for which revenue has not been recognized that generally result from deferred maintenance and support  consulting or training services not yet rendered and license revenue deferred until all requirements under sop are met 
deferred revenue is recognized upon delivery of our product  as services are rendered  or as other requirements requiring deferral under sop are satisfied 
accounts receivable include only amounts due from customers for which revenue has been recognized 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices 
for those invoices not specifically reviewed  provisions are provided based on historical collection experience 
if the data we use to calculate the allowance provided for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables  additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and the future results of operations could be materially affected 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 

table of contents software development costs we account for software development costs in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
sfas no 
specifies that costs incurred internally in creating a computer software product should be charged to expense when incurred as research and development costs until technological feasibility has been established for the product 
once technological feasibility is established  all development costs should be capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers 
for new versions of our products  we typically achieve technological feasibility far enough in advance of general release to warrant the capitalization of subsequent development costs 
judgment is required in determining when the technological feasibility of a product is established  in estimating the life of the product for which the capitalized costs will be amortized and in estimating if the carrying value of capitalized software costs is equal to or less than future operating profits from the associated products 
goodwill and intangible assets we have a significant amount of intangible assets related to goodwill and other acquired intangibles 
the determination of related estimated useful lives and whether or not these assets are impaired involves significant judgment 
we account for the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets 
changes in market conditions  business conditions or strategy could significantly impact these judgments and require negative adjustments to recorded asset balances 
we performed the first of the required annual impairment tests of goodwill in the fourth quarter of and determined that no adjustments were required 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating actual current tax liability together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
this process also includes estimating tax liabilities related to tax audits that can be conducted in any jurisdiction where we have operated 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheet 
we then assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we include an expense within the tax provision of the consolidated statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
we record a valuation allowance due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of the deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward  foreign tax credits and general business credits  before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to adjust our valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
merger  realignment and other charges we account for merger  realignment and other charges in accordance with fasb emerging issues task force eitf topic no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity  and eitf no 
 recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase 
table of contents business combination 
we have recorded significant liabilities in connection with our mergers and realignment programs 
these liabilities primarily consist of estimated costs to terminate employees and exit facilities 
particularly  these liabilities include management s estimates pertaining to sublease activities  restoration costs and lease buyouts for facilities around the world 
as we continue to evaluate the commercial real estate market around the world  enter into sublease agreements  vacate facilities and negotiate with landlords  we may be required to significantly adjust our original realignment liability 
any adjustments to our accrued merger  realignment and other charges would be recorded in the period such determination is made 
results of operations the discussion and analysis of our results of operations for the years ended december    is structured to take the following events into account the ibm transaction  which was completed during the quarter ended september  the database business  the assets of which were sold to ibm  accounted for of our revenue during the first half of and for the year ended december  the strategic realignment that we undertook during the second half of this realignment led to a transition from five former business units into two operating businesses ascential software and informix software the database business that we sold to ibm in the ibm transaction 
references to ascential software in this report refer to our existing enterprise integration business  references to informix software refer to our legacy database business assets sold to ibm on july   and references to ascential software corporation refer to ascential software and informix software on a combined basis 
a comparison of revenue and expenses for the years ended december  and  respectively  provides little insight as a result of the ibm transaction

as described above  we have identified revenue recognition as one of our critical accounting policies 
as part of the revenue recognition process  significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
revenue results are difficult to predict  and any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 

table of contents license revenue 
license revenue may involve our shipment of product or our granting of a license to a customer to manufacture products that incorporate our technology 
our products are sold directly to end user customers or through resellers  including original equipment manufacturers oems  distributors and value added resellers vars 
revenue from license agreements with resellers is recognized as earned by us  generally  when sell through has occurred  the licenses are resold or utilized by the reseller and all of our related obligations have been satisfied 
our license transactions can vary in size and it is difficult to forecast both the timing and dollar value of transactions 
as a result  license transactions have caused fluctuations in net revenues and net income loss because of the relatively high gross margin on such revenues 
as is common in the software industry  a disproportionate amount of our license revenue is derived from transactions that close in the last weeks or days of a quarter 
the timing of closing large license agreements also increases the risk of quarter to quarter fluctuations 
we expect that these types of transactions and the resulting fluctuations in revenue will continue 
service revenue 
service revenue is comprised of maintenance  consulting and education revenues 
maintenance contracts generally call for us to provide technical support and software updates to customers 
maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract  generally on a straight line basis when all revenue recognition requirements are met 
other service revenue  primarily training and consulting  is generally recognized at the time the service is performed and it is determined that we have fulfilled our obligations resulting from the services contract 
ascential software license revenue years ended december   and the following table compares the license revenue for the ascential software product lines for the years ended december   and in millions years ended december  enterprise integration content management i 
decide i 
sell total license revenue during and  we terminated various product lines in an effort to focus product sales on our enterprise integration product offerings that had been expanded during that time 
as a result  license revenue for ascential software for the twelve months ended december  decreased or million to million from million for the same period in the decrease consists of an million decrease in revenue from our content management product line  which we stopped selling during the quarter ended june   a million decrease in revenue from our i 
decide product  which was abandoned as a result of the sale of the assets related to our database business  and a million decrease in revenue from our i 
sell product  which was discontinued in the first quarter of these declines were partially offset by a or million increase in revenue from enterprise integration products 
this increase was caused by the addition of products and technology acquired from torrent  vality and metagenix that were integrated into our enterprise integration product offering and the release of new products during this expanded offering contributed to increased sales volume and an increase to the list prices of our products that enabled us to achieve higher average selling prices in the overall increase in sales of enterprise integration products was positively impacted during by leveraging the reseller arrangement that we entered into with ibm during the second half of whereby ibm sells our products 
license revenue under this arrangement increased million during total revenue from ibm represented of our total revenue in termination of this arrangement with ibm  should it occur  could have a material impact on our future financial results if we are unable to replace the revenue 

table of contents license revenue decreased or million to million in from million in this decrease was due primarily to the termination of sales of our e commerce solution product  i 
sell  during the first quarter of resulting in a million decline in license revenue while sales of our content management products declined during by million 
this decrease was partially offset by license revenues for enterprise integration products that increased to million from million in and license revenue from our analytic offering  i 
decide  that increased million from million in to million in due to the early stage of this product 
we experienced a slowing of license revenue growth during the second half of we believe this was due in part to certain customers and potential customers deferring spending on information technology as a result of the general economic downturn 
ascential software service revenue years ended december   and the following table compares service revenue for the ascential software product lines for the years ended december   and in millions years ended december  maintenance revenue enterprise integration content management i

as such  the service revenue associated with those sales declined resulting in a or million decrease during the twelve months ended december  to million from million for the same period in this is primarily due to a million decline in service revenue associated with content management products  a million decline in service revenues from our analytic offering i 
decide and a million decline in service revenue from our i 
sell product 
these declines were partially offset by an increase in total enterprise integration service revenue  the components of which are described below 
total maintenance revenue increased by or million to million in the twelve months ended december  from million for the same period in the increase is due to a or million increase in maintenance revenue from enterprise integration products that is attributable to the growing installed base of customers  including customers acquired from vality and torrent 
the increase was partially offset by decreased maintenance revenue related to the termination of products and the associated decline in their maintenance revenue streams  including a million decrease in maintenance revenue 
table of contents principally associated with our i 
decide product line  a million decrease in content management maintenance revenue and a million decrease in i 
sell maintenance revenue 
revenue derived from consulting and training decreased or million to million in the twelve months ended december  from million for the same period in this decrease is attributable to a million decrease in consulting revenue associated with content management products  a million decrease in consulting and training revenue primarily associated with the discontinuation of our i 
decide product  a million decrease associated with the discontinuation of our i 
sell products and an or million decrease in consulting revenue related to enterprise integration product offerings 
this decrease of million consists of a million decrease due principally to three large consulting projects that were in process during but which were completed during and not completely replaced by new projects  a decline in product license revenue in the first quarter of  which had an impact on follow on services purchased  and an increase in indirect sales of products whereby the associated services are delivered by third parties 
these declines were partially offset by an increase in consulting and training revenue associated with new licenses 
we expect that  barring unforeseen circumstances  future growth of consulting  maintenance and education revenue will be largely dependent on the growth of license revenue 
service revenue for the twelve months ended december  includes million of revenue associated with the content management product line 
we expect that the content management revenue stream will continue to decline over the first half of until all the related service contracts are fulfilled 
service revenue increased to million in from million in  despite a million decline resulting from the termination of the i 
sell product offering 
maintenance revenue increased to million in from million in this is principally due to a million increase in enterprise integration maintenance revenue as we continued to build our installed customer base  and and million increases in content management and i 
decide maintenance revenue  respectively  during that time due to their early stage as products 
these increases were offset by a million decline in i 
sell maintenance revenue 
consulting and education revenue decreased to million in from million in this decrease is primarily due to a million decline in revenue derived from i 
sell education and consulting 
this decline was partially offset by million and million increases in content management and i 
decide consulting and education revenue  respectively  due to the early stage of those products in and a million increase in enterprise integration consulting revenue which is primarily a result of the increase in license revenue during  as consulting and education revenue have historically been driven by engagements and projects associated with new license revenue 
there were three large datastage consulting engagements initiated during that generated approximately million in consulting revenue 
informix software revenue for years ended december  and due to the ibm transaction  we separately discuss the revenue of informix software for the first and second halves of compared to the corresponding periods in there was no revenue derived from informix software in the following table compares the revenue for informix software for the six month 
table of contents periods ended june  and  respectively  together with the six month periods ended december  and  respectively  and the years ended december  and  respectively in millions six months ended six months ended years ended june  december  december  informix software license revenue service revenue maintenance revenue consulting and education revenue total service revenue total revenue informix software license revenue six months ended june  and license revenue decreased to million for the six months ended june  from million for the same period in the decline was primarily a result of a decrease in license revenue from the traditional client server products of the database business and also from a decrease in large enterprise transactions 
these trends resulted from our being less successful in attracting significant new database customers and in securing additional business from our existing database customers 
our principal competitors in the database business  oracle  ibm and microsoft  were much larger  much better financed  and continued to invest substantially in their database businesses 
strategic partners in the database business including the major enterprise software application providers therefore promoted our competitors products more than they promoted our database products 
as a result  we were not successful in attracting significant new database customers 
in addition  most of our database customers who had invested in our traditional client server and tools products were in the process of replacing those products and purchasing newer products 
because of our competitive position described above  many of our database customers chose to purchase newer database products from our competitors 
we also believe that the prevailing economic slowdown had led to a deferral by some existing customers and potential customers of their decisions to enter into large enterprise transactions 
in addition  we believe the impending closing of the ibm transaction may have impaired our ability to close certain transactions during the second quarter of during  we recognized revenue from resellers with previously recorded customer advances of million primarily related to sales of informix software products 
the million recognized included million of revenues related to licenses that were resold or utilized by the reseller and million related to contractual reductions in customer advances  which typically arise when a reseller agreement expires before the advance balance is fully utilized 
in addition  we recorded million of further reductions to the customer advances liabilities during as the net result of the transfer of the database customer advances to ibm as part of the ibm transaction  which were offset by any additional amounts we received from customers during during  we recognized revenue of million as a result of contractual reductions in customer advances 
during  we recorded million of revenue from the customer advances balance in respect of a transaction with a customer that was previously a supplier of services to informix software under a long term contract 
concurrent with the revenue transaction with this customer  we entered into an arrangement to terminate these services  pursuant to which we paid a termination fee of million

the decrease in service revenue in was attributable primarily to a decline in consulting revenue in our database business

cost of software consists primarily of amortization of capitalized or acquired software development costs and write offs of previously capitalized software  third party royalties  and distribution and documentation costs 
during the twelve months ended december   cost of software increased by or million to million from million during the same period of the most significant item contributing to the increase was million of impairment charges related to the termination of product lines  million associated with the content management product line and million associated with our former axielle product  our portal offering 
software amortization increased by million as a result of a million increase in amortization of purchased technology  principally related to the acquisitions of torrent and vality  and million of amortization related to the acquisition of the metarecon technology 
software amortization related to internally capitalized software declined by million primarily as a result of the impairment of the content management and axielle technology 
we acquired million of completed technology through the torrent acquisition on november  and million of completed technology through the vality acquisition on april  both are being amortized over three years on a straight line basis 
we have paid approximately million through december  to acquire and further develop metarecon and are amortizing payments over three years on a straight line basis 
future amortization costs may increase if we acquire new technology through strategic business combinations or technology purchases 
royalty costs declined by million primarily related to the decline in sales of content management and i 
sell product offerings that were sold with much higher third party royalty costs than enterprise integration products 
once these product lines were terminated  we were no longer required to pay the related royalties 
as part of the settlement of a dispute with former shareholders of integrasoft  inc  which we acquired in  we recorded million of prepaid royalties that we are amortizing over eighteen months on a straight line basis and will be fully amortized by december  the amortization of this prepaid royalty is the most significant component of ongoing royalty costs 
the costs of distribution personnel and media increased by million during this is due to the fact that this function was shared with the informix database business during most of and the costs to operate the function on a stand alone basis exceed the portion of shared costs previously allocated to the ascential software operation 
cost of services 
cost of services consists of maintenance  consulting and training personnel expenses and subcontracting costs 
cost of services for the twelve months ended december  decreased or million to million from million for the same period in the decrease is primarily a result of a reduction in services headcount between december  and december  even after we added approximately services employees through the acquisition of vality 
the cost savings related to the headcount reductions were offset somewhat by increased subcontracting costs as we moved toward a 
table of contents more variable cost model for delivering our consulting services 
the following table summarizes service margins for the twelve months ended december  and twelve months ended december  ascential software total service margin maintenance margin consulting education margin the total service margin has improved to in the twelve months ended december  from in the same period in this improvement is caused  in part  by an increase in the proportion of the higher margin maintenance revenue to total services revenue for the same periods 
for the twelve months ended december   the maintenance business represented of total service revenue and generated a margin of while  for the twelve months ended december   the maintenance business represented of total service revenue and generated a margin of 
barring unforeseen circumstances  we expect maintenance margins to continue to improve slightly during as the number of customers subscribing to maintenance increases and we further leverage our technical support personnel as well as our e 
service web support site to resolve customer issues 
the improvement in the consulting and education margins to in from in is a result of cost control efforts and improved utilization of consultants 
this margin improvement was partially offset by the wind down of the content management business where the completion of consulting engagements for that business required additional use of third parties and yielded a loss 
cost of services for the year ended december  includes million of costs associated with the content management business 
as the utilization of consultants on non revenue generating projects and activities focused on procuring new business decreases during  barring unforeseen circumstances  we expect the margin improvement to continue and be positive in we expect that  barring unforeseen circumstances  costs associated with the content management business will continue to decline in and do not expect such costs to recur beyond the second quarter of when substantially all consulting  service and support contracts associated with that product line should end 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions  marketing and communications programs and related overhead costs 
sales and marketing expenses for the twelve months ended december  decreased to million from million for the same period in this decrease is primarily due to a reduction in sales and marketing headcount between december  and december  as well as a reduction in marketing program expenditures 
approximately sales and marketing employees were added through the acquisition of vality  however these increases were more than offset by reductions to the total sales and marketing headcount  which was at december   including quota carrying sales representatives 
although headcount was reduced during  our focus throughout the year was also to shift sales headcount to those regions with more revenue growth potential and to improve the sales productivity of our sales force 
we believe that we have made significant progress in both these initiatives 
sales headcount may increase during depending on the revenue  productivity and growth levels that we may experience 
sales and marketing expenses for the twelve months ended december  include million of costs associated with the content management business  which we do not expect to recur beyond  barring unforeseen circumstances 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries  third party project consulting and related overhead costs for product development 
development efforts during were focused on integrating the technology acquired from vality  torrent and metagenix and creating major enhancements to our enterprise integration product suite 
research and development expense for the twelve months ended december  decreased  or million  to million from million 
table of contents for the same period in this decline is due primarily to a reduction of million in amortization of goodwill and acquired workforce in the twelve months ended december  as compared to the same period of this reduction was a result of the implementation of sfas effective january  which eliminated the amortization of intangibles with indefinite lives 
additionally  total engineering headcount was reduced by between december  and december  this headcount reduction relates to employees associated with the content management product line and is net of the addition of approximately engineering employees in connection with the acquisition of vality 
these cost reductions were offset by increased net expense resulting from a reduction in the amount of internal software capitalized 
we capitalized million less in the twelve months ended december  as compared to the same period in the prior year as a result of reduced headcount costs and the timing and status of engineering projects during as compared to we will continue to focus our development efforts on enterprise integration products and expect a slight increase in research and development expenses in research and development expenses for the twelve months ended december  included million of costs associated with the content management business  which  barring unforeseen circumstances  we do not expect to recur past general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of finance  legal  information systems  human resources  bad debt expense and related overhead costs 
during the twelve months ended december   general and administrative expenses increased or million to million from million for the same twelve months in the increase in general and administrative expenses experienced during the year is attributable to several factors 
the entire year of included personnel and information technology infrastructure costs for a fully staffed and independent general and administrative function 
in contrast  general and administrative expenses for the first three quarters of were ratably distributed over the ascential software business and the informix software business 
in order to function independently  we were required to appropriately staff these functions and our corporate expenditures for audit and tax advisory fees  insurance costs  and similar services also increased resulting in an overall increase of administrative costs of million compared to in addition  the twelve months ended december  includes an increase of million in certain  primarily litigation and dispute related  legal costs compared to the same period of the previous year 
the increased costs in the twelve months ended december  are offset by a decline of million in bad debt expense 
following the sale of assets related to our database business and during the segmentation of accounts receivable balances in connection with that sale  several ascential software accounts were identified which were deemed to be uncollectible 
this segmentation process  combined with the termination of the i 
sell product resulted in an unusually high bad debt expense during of million 
while bad debt expense declined significantly during  million of the amount recorded in related to accounts associated with sales of content management products which became uncollectible as a result of the change in strategy for that product line during as a result of the reserves recorded for the content management product receivable and improvement in the collectibility of receivable balances due to increased transactions with fortune companies we reported dso  or days sales outstanding  of days at december  compared to days at december  dso is calculated by dividing accounts receivable net  as of the balance sheet date  by the quotient determined by dividing the current quarter s net revenue by ninety days 
barring unforeseen circumstances  we expect that our bad debt expense will decline during as compared to as discussed above  we believe that the recording of the allowance for doubtful accounts is one of our critical accounting policies 
the preparation of financial statements requires our management to assess the collectibility of our accounts receivables and make estimates of any allowances required with respect to doubtful accounts 
we record an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts when the prospect of collecting a specific account receivable becomes doubtful 
we regularly review the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts after considering the size of the accounts receivable aging  the age of each invoice  each customer s expected ability to pay and our collection history with each customer 
we review any invoice greater than days past due to determine if an allowance is appropriate based on the risk category using the factors discussed above 
for all invoices that are not specifically reserved  we maintain a reserve based on an estimate of potentially uncollectible receivables 
the allowance for doubtful accounts represents our best 
table of contents estimate  but changes in circumstances relating to accounts receivable may result in a requirement for additional allowances in the future 
general and administrative expenses for the twelve months ended december   included million of costs associated with the content management business  principally bad debt expense 
barring unforeseen circumstances  we do not expect these costs to recur beyond merger  realignment and other costs 
these costs are discussed separately in section iv

at the date of the acquisition  we expected to invest another million of development costs in this product 
due to turnover of research and development personnel  management now estimates  barring unforeseen circumstances  that this project will be completed by the end of the second quarter of and we expect to invest approximately another million into development in order to do so 
as of the vality acquisition date  wave  irt or auto technologies had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative uses 
the technological feasibility of the in process product is established when the enterprise has completed all planning  designing  coding and testing activities that are necessary to establish that the product can be produced to meet its design specifications 
the value of iprd was determined using an income approach 
this approach takes into consideration earnings remaining after deducting from cash flows related to the in process technology  the market rates of return on contributory assets  including assembled workforce  customer accounts and existing technology 
the cash flows are then discounted to present value at an appropriate rate 
discount rates are determined by an analysis of the risks associated with each of the identified intangible assets 
the discount rate used for iprd ranged from to  consistent with the characteristics of each iprd project  a premium over the estimated weighted average cost of capital of 
the resulting net cash flows to which the discount rate was applied are based on management s estimates of revenues  operating expenses  and income taxes from such acquired technology

for  other income included approximately million of net realized gains on the sale of long term investments and approximately million of tax refunds received in china 
we continue to liquidate various subsidiaries that were active prior to the ibm transaction but which are no longer required for our ongoing operations 
as these subsidiaries become substantially liquidated  the translation adjustment that has accumulated on our balance sheet in connection with the historical monthly revaluation of their assets and liabilities will be recorded as other income or expense

income taxes ascential software corporation years ended december  income loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit effective tax rate during  we realized a tax benefit on losses generated at a rate that was less than the statutory rate of approximately 
this was due to the impact of the us alternative minimum tax on the carry back of us net operating losses and the impact of income taxes and withholding taxes owed in foreign jurisdictions 
income tax expense in was primarily attributable to taxable gains in the united states and foreign jurisdictions resulting from the gain from the ibm transaction 
the income tax expense on the gain resulting from the ibm transaction was calculated after the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards that were previously fully reserved

in january  we received million from ibm  related to the ibm transaction  that consisted of a million holdback plus million of interest on the holdback see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we plan to continue to invest in research and development activities as well as sales and marketing and product support 
our investment in property and equipment is expected to continue  barring unforeseen circumstances  as we purchase computer systems for research and development  sales and marketing  and support and administrative staff 
during the year ended december   capital expenditures totaled million 
as of december   we did not have any significant long term debt or significant commitments for capital expenditures 
we believe that our current cash and short term investments balances will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
we also believe that we will have sufficient resources to continue to fund repurchases of common stock under the announced million stock repurchase program  and to fund the costs of current and future facilities  severance and other obligations associated with the ibm transaction in addition to current and future restructuring initiatives

payment under the standby letter of credit would be due upon final assessment of this tax liability 
in addition  we were also required to enter into standby letters of credit to guarantee approximately million of lease payments for certain facilities in europe 
these guarantees do not have expiration dates and would allow landlords to obtain lease payments from our bank if we were to default on our lease payment obligations 
our cash and short term investments totaled million at december  this represented an increase of million from million at december   which was primarily the result of million in proceeds received from the ibm transaction see note of notes to consolidated financial statements offset by stock repurchases of million  income tax payments of million  the purchase of torrent for million and a cash payment of million in connection with the settlement of our private securities litigation see note of notes to consolidated financial statements

disclosures about market rate risk market rate risk 
the following discussion about our market rate risk involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and equity security price risk 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate risk 
our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we maintain a short term investment portfolio consisting mainly of debt securities with an average maturity of less than two years 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio and we place our investments with high quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we are averse to principal loss and seek to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by percent from levels at december   the fair value of the portfolio would decline by approximately million 
although we intend to utilize our fixed income investments to fund operations and acquisitions as needed  we currently have the ability to hold our fixed 
table of contents income investments until maturity and believe that the effect  if any  of potential near term changes in interest rates on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows would not be material 
equity security price risk 
we hold a small portfolio of marketable equity traded securities that are subject to market price volatility 
equity price fluctuations of plus or minus would have an impact of million on the value of these securities in foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency risk due to fluctuations in exchange rates underlying the value of inter company accounts receivable and payable denominated in foreign currencies primarily european and asian currencies until such receivables are collected and payables are disbursed 
a foreign currency forward exchange contract obligates us to exchange predetermined amounts of specified foreign currencies at specified exchange rates on specified dates or to make an equivalent us dollar payment equal to the value of such exchange 
these foreign currency forward exchange contracts are denominated in the same currency in which the underlying foreign currency receivables or payables are denominated and bear a contract value and maturity date which approximate the value and expected settlement date of the underlying transactions 
as these contracts are not designated as hedges  as defined by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  discounts or premiums the difference between the spot exchange rate and the forward exchange rate at inception of the contract are recorded in earnings to other income expense  net at the time of purchase  and changes in market value of the underlying contract are recorded in earnings as foreign exchange gains or losses in the period in which they occur 
we operate in certain countries in latin america  eastern europe  and asia pacific where there are limited forward foreign currency exchange markets and thus we may have un hedged exposures in these currencies 
most of our international revenue and expenses are denominated in local currencies 
due to the substantial volatility of currency exchange rates  among other factors  we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our future operating results 
although we take into account changes in exchange rates in our pricing strategy  there would be a time lapse between any sudden or significant exchange rate movements and our implementation of a revised pricing structure 
in addition  we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our future operating results because of the length of our average sales cycle which depends on a number of factors including the level of competition and the size of the transaction 
notwithstanding our efforts to manage foreign exchange risk  there can be no assurances that our hedging activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations 
the table below provides information about our foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
the information is provided in us dollar equivalents and presents the notional amount contract amount  the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates and fair value 
fair value represents the difference in value of the contracts at the market forward rate at december  and the forward contract rate 
all contracts mature within three months 
in addition to the contracts listed below  at december   we had accrued  as a component of accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet  a loss of million related to the fair market value of forward currency contracts that had closed as of december  but were not settled until january

factors that may affect future results if we do not make effective use of the proceeds of our substantial cash resources  our financial results could suffer and the value of our common stock could decline 
our ability to increase stockholder value is dependent  in part  on our effective use of the cash proceeds of the sale of our database business assets to ibm 
at december   as a result of the ibm transaction and our continuing operations  we held approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
we intend to use the proceeds to continue to operate our business  repurchase shares of our common stock and to finance any strategic acquisitions 
we cannot ensure that these measures will increase stockholder value 
if we are unable to increase revenue from  and expand the market share of our products  our financial results will be materially adversely affected 
if we do not increase sales of our enterprise data integration products  our financial results will be materially adversely affected 
our revenue is derived almost entirely from our core data integration products datastage  integrity  and metarecon 
in order to increase revenues and grow our business  we must be 
table of contents able to increase sales of these products and our share of the enterprise data integration market 
we cannot ensure that our current customers will continue to purchase our data integration product offerings and related services and that new customers will choose our solutions over our competitors product offerings 
if the enterprise data integration market declines or does not grow  we may sell fewer products and services and our business may be unable to sustain its current level of operations 
if the growth rates for the enterprise data integration market decline for any reason  there will be a decrease in demand for our products and services  which would have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
we have invested substantial resources in developing data integration products and services to compete in this market 
the market for these products and services is evolving  and its growth depends upon an increasing need to store and manage complex data and upon broader market acceptance of our products as a solution for this need 
declining demand for our products and services could threaten our ability to sustain our present level of operations and meet our expectations for future growth 
intense competition could adversely affect our ability to sell our products and services 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors which could impair our ability to sell our products 
the market for our products and services is highly competitive  diverse and subject to rapid change 
in particular  we expect that the technology underlying our products and services will continue to change rapidly 
it is possible that our products and solutions will be rendered obsolete by technological advances 
we currently face intense competition from a number of sources  including several large vendors that develop and market applications  development tools  decision support products  consulting services and or complete database driven solutions for the internet 
our principal competitors in the enterprise data integration business include in house customer programming for extracting and delivering data and vendors of etl products that address that part of the data integration problem  such as eti  informatica  hummingbird and sagent 
principal data profiling competitors include avellino  and evoke 
principal data quality competitors include firstlogic  innovative systems  group one and trillium 
these competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies  evolving markets and changes in customer requirements 
in addition  market consolidations could create more formidable competitors 
competition may affect the pricing of our products or services and changes in product mix may occur  either of which may reduce our profit margins 
existing and future competition or changes in our product or service offerings or pricing could result in an immediate reduction in the prices of our products or services 
in addition  a significant change in the mix of software products and services that we sell  including the mix between higher margin software and maintenance products and lower margin consulting and training  could materially adversely affect our operating results for future periods 
in addition  the pricing strategies of competitors in the software industry have historically been characterized by aggressive price discounting to encourage volume purchasing by customers 
we may not be able to compete effectively against competitors who continue to aggressively discount the prices of their products 
our financial results are subject to fluctuations caused by many factors that could result in our failing to achieve anticipated financial results 
our quarterly and annual financial results have varied significantly in the past and are likely to continue to vary in the future due to a number of factors described below and elsewhere in this management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations section  many of which are beyond our control 
in particular  if a large number of the orders that are typically booked at the end of a quarter are not booked  our net income for that quarter could be substantially reduced 
in addition  the failure to meet market 
table of contents expectations could cause a sharp drop in our stock price 
these and any one or more of the factors listed below or other factors could cause us not to achieve our revenue or profitability expectations 
these factors include changes in demand for our products and services  including changes in growth rates in the software industry as a whole and in the enterprise data integration market  the size  timing and contractual terms of large orders for our software products and services  possible delays in or inability to recognize revenue as the result of revenue recognition rules  the budgeting cycles of our customers and potential customers  any downturn in our customers businesses  in the domestic economy or in international economies where our customers do substantial business  changes in our pricing policies resulting from competitive pressures  such as aggressive price discounting by our competitors  or other factors  our ability to develop and introduce on a timely basis new or enhanced versions of our products and services  unexpected needs for capital expenditures or other unanticipated expenses  changes in the mix of revenues attributable to domestic and international sales  and seasonal fluctuations in buying patterns 
our recognition of deferred revenue is subject to future performance obligations and may not be representative of revenues for succeeding periods 
our deferred revenue was million as of december  the timing and ultimate recognition of our deferred revenue depends on our performance of various service obligations 
because of the possibility of customer changes in development schedules  delays in implementation and development efforts and the need to satisfactorily perform product support services  deferred revenue at any particular date may not be representative of actual revenue for any succeeding period 
our common stock has been and likely will continue to be subject to substantial price and volume fluctuations that may prevent stockholders from reselling their shares at or above the prices at which they purchased their shares 
fluctuations in the price and trading volume of our common stock may prevent stockholders from selling their shares at or above the prices at which they purchased their shares 
stock prices and trading volumes for many software companies fluctuate widely for a number of reasons  including some reasons that may be unrelated to the companies businesses or financial results 
this market volatility  as well as general domestic or international economic  market and political conditions  including threats of terrorism  could materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock without regard to our operating performance 
in addition  our operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and may continue to fluctuate significantly for a number of reasons  including market uncertainty about our business prospects or the prospects for the enterprise data integration market  revenues or results of operations that do not meet or exceed analysts and investors expectations  the introduction of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors  any challenges integrating people  operations or products associated with recent acquisitions  
table of contents general business conditions in the software industry  the technology sector  or in the domestic or international economies  and uncertainty and economic instability resulting from terrorist acts and other acts of violence or war 
our financial success depends upon our ability to maintain and leverage relationships with strategic partners 
we may not be able to maintain our strategic relationships or attract sufficient additional strategic partners who are able to market our products and services effectively 
our ability to increase the sales of our products and our future success depends in part upon maintaining and increasing relationships with strategic partners 
in addition to our direct sales force  we rely on relationships with a variety of strategic partners  including systems integrators  resellers and distributors in the united states and abroad 
further  we have become more reliant upon resellers in international areas in which we do not have a direct sales team 
our strategic partners may offer products of several different companies  including  in some cases  products that compete with our products 
in addition  our strategic partners may acquire businesses or product lines that compete with our products 
we have limited control  if any  as to whether these strategic partners devote adequate resources to promoting  selling and implementing our products 
if our strategic partners do not devote adequate resources for implementation of our products and services  we will incur substantial additional costs associated with hiring and training additional qualified technical personnel to implement solutions for our customers 
in addition  our relationships with our strategic partners may not generate enough revenue to offset the significant resources used to develop and support these relationships 
we may not be able to retain our key personnel and attract and retain the new personnel necessary to grow our businesses  which could materially adversely affect our ability to develop and sell our products  support our business operations and grow our business 
the competition for experienced  well qualified personnel in the software industry is intense 
our future success depends on retaining the services of key personnel in all functional areas of our company  including engineering  sales  marketing  consulting and corporate services 
for instance  we may be unable to continue to develop and support technologically advanced products and services if we fail to retain and attract highly qualified engineers  and to market and sell those products and services if we fail to retain and attract well qualified marketing and sales professionals 
we may be unable to retain key employees in all of these areas and we may not succeed in attracting new employees 
if we fail to retain  attract and motivate key employees  we may be unable to develop  market and sell new products and services  which could materially adversely affect our operating and financial results 
fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies could result in currency transaction losses 
despite efforts to manage foreign exchange risk  our hedging activities may not adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations  particularly in hyper inflationary countries where hedging is not available or practical 
as a consequence  we may incur losses in connection with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
most of our international revenue and expenses are denominated in local currencies 
due to the substantial volatility of currency exchange rates  among other factors  we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our future operating results 
although we take into account changes in exchange rates in our pricing strategy  there would be a time lapse between any sudden or significant exchange rate movements and our implementation of a revised pricing structure 
accordingly  we may have substantial pricing exposure as a result of foreign exchange volatility during the period between pricing reviews 
in addition  as noted previously  the sales cycles for our products are relatively long 
foreign currency fluctuations could  therefore  result in substantial changes in the financial impact of a specific transaction between the time of initial customer contact and revenue recognition 
we have a foreign exchange hedging program that is intended to hedge the value of inter company accounts receivable or inter company accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies against fluctuations in exchange rates until such receivables are collected or payables are disbursed 

table of contents if we do not respond adequately to our industry s evolving technology standards or do not continue to meet the sophisticated needs of our customers  sales of our products and solutions may decline 
our future success will depend on our ability to address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers by supporting existing and emerging hardware  software  database and networking platforms 
we will have to develop and introduce commercially viable enhancements to our existing products and services on a timely basis to keep pace with technological developments  evolving industry standards and changing customer requirements 
if we do not enhance our products and services to meet these evolving needs  we will not sell as many products and services and our position in existing  emerging or potential markets could be eroded rapidly by other product advances 
in addition  commercial acceptance of our products and services also could be adversely affected by critical or negative statements or reports by brokerage firms  industry and financial analysts and the media about us or our products or business  or by the advertising or marketing efforts of competitors  or by other factors that could adversely affect consumer perception 
our product development efforts will continue to require substantial financial and operational investment 
we may not be able to internally develop new products and services quickly enough to respond to market forces 
as a result  we may have to acquire technology or access to products or services through mergers and acquisitions  investments and partnering arrangements  any of which may require us to use significant financial resources 
alternatively  we may not be able to forge partnering arrangements or strategic alliances on satisfactory terms  or at all  with the companies of our choice 
our future revenue and our ability to make investments in developing our products is substantially dependent upon our installed customer base continuing to license our products and renew our service agreements 
we depend on our installed customer base for future revenue from services and licenses of additional products 
if our customers fail to renew their maintenance agreements  our revenue will decline 
our maintenance agreements are generally renewable annually at the option of the customers and there are no minimum payment obligations or obligations to license additional software 
therefore  current customers may not necessarily generate significant maintenance revenue in future periods 
in addition  customers may not necessarily purchase additional products or services 
our services revenue and maintenance revenue also depends upon the continued use of these services by our installed customer base 
any downturn in software license revenue could result in lower services revenue in current or future quarters 
seasonal trends in sales of our software products could adversely affect our quarterly operating results  and our lengthy sales cycles for products makes our revenues susceptible to fluctuations 
our sales of software products and services have been affected by seasonal purchasing trends that materially affect our quarter to quarter operating results 
we expect these seasonal trends to continue in the future 
revenue and operating results in our first quarter are typically lower relative to other quarters because many customers make purchase decisions for the fourth quarter based on their calendar year end budgeting requirements  and as a new year begins start planning for  but not implementing  new information technology spending until later in the year 
our sales cycles typically take many months to complete and vary depending on the product or service that is being sold 
the length of the sales cycle may vary depending on a number of factors over which we have little or no control  including the size of a potential transaction and the level of competition that we encounter in our selling activities 
the sales cycle can be further extended for sales made through resellers and third party distributors 
the success of our international operations is dependent upon many factors that could adversely affect our ability to sell our products internationally and could affect our profitability 
international sales represent approximately of our total revenue 
our international operations are  and any expanded international operations will be  subject to a variety of risks associated with conducting 
table of contents business internationally that could adversely affect our ability to sell our products internationally and  therefore  our profitability  including the following difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  problems in collecting accounts receivable  longer payment cycles  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  seasonal reductions in business activity during the summer months in europe and certain other parts of the world  uncertainties relative to regional  political and economic circumstances  recessionary environments in domestic or foreign economies and increases in tariffs  duties  price controls or other restrictions on foreign currencies or trade barriers imposed by countries  and other changes in applicable foreign laws 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights  competitors may be able to use our technology or trademarks which would weaken our competitive position  reduce our revenue and increase costs 
our business success will continue to be heavily dependent upon proprietary technology 
we rely primarily on a combination of patent  copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights 
these means of protecting proprietary rights may not be adequate  and the inability to protect intellectual property rights may adversely affect our business and or financial condition 
we currently hold a number of united states patents and pending applications 
there can be no assurance that any other patents covering our inventions will be issued or that any patent  if issued  will provide sufficiently broad protection or will prove enforceable in actions against alleged infringements 
our ability to sell our products and services and to prevent competitors from misappropriating our proprietary technology and trade names is dependent upon protecting our intellectual property 
our products are generally licensed to end users on a right to use basis under a license that restricts the use of the products for the customer s internal business purposes 
despite such precautions  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of our current or future products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
in addition  we have licensed the source code of our products to certain customers under certain circumstances and for restricted uses 
we also have entered into source code escrow agreements with a number of our customers that generally require release of our source code to the customer in the event of bankruptcy  insolvency  or discontinuation of our business or support of a product line  in each case where support and maintenance of the product line is not assumed by a third party 
we may also be unable to protect our technology because competitors may independently develop similar or superior technology  policing unauthorized use of software is difficult  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights in software to the same extent as do the laws of the united states  shrink wrap and or click wrap licenses may be wholly or partially unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions  and litigation to enforce intellectual property rights  to protect trade secrets  or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources 

table of contents our software may have defects and errors  which may lead to a loss of revenue or product liability claims 
software products are internally complex and occasionally contain defects or errors  especially when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released 
despite extensive testing  we may not detect errors in our new products  platforms or product enhancements until after we have commenced commercial shipments 
if defects and errors are discovered in our products  platforms or product enhancements after commercial release then potential customers may delay or forego purchases  our reputation in the marketplace may be damaged  we may incur additional service and warranty costs  and we may have to divert additional development resources to correct the defects and errors 
if any or all of the foregoing occur  we may lose revenues or incur higher operating expenses and lose market share  any of which could severely harm our financial condition and operating results 
in the future  third parties could  for competitive or other reasons  assert that our products infringe their intellectual property rights 
in the future  third parties could  for competitive or other reasons  assert that our products infringe their intellectual property rights 
any such claims could be time consuming to defend  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
royalty or license agreements may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
we expect that software product developers will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in the software industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
the loss of our rights to use software licensed to us by third parties could harm our business 
in order to provide a complete product suite  we occasionally license software from third parties  and sub license this software to our customers 
in addition  we license software programs from third parties and incorporate these programs into our own software products 
by utilizing third party software in our business  we incur risks that are not associated with developing software in house 
for example  these third party providers may discontinue or alter their operations  terminate their relationship with us  or generally become unable to fulfill their obligations to us 
if any of these circumstances were to occur  we may be forced to seek alternative technology that may not be available on commercially reasonable terms 
in the future  we may be forced to obtain additional third party software licenses to enhance our product offerings and compete more effectively 
we may not be able to obtain and maintain licensing rights to needed technology on commercially reasonable terms  which would harm our business and operating results 
we have substantial real estate lease commitments for unoccupied space and restoration obligations  and if we are unable to sublet this space on acceptable terms our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 
we are party to real estate leases for approximately  square feet that are unoccupied 
at december   we have a restructuring reserve of consisting of million for lease obligations and million for restoration costs related to the disposition of this space as of december  in establishing this reserve  we have assumed that we will be able to sublet the available space and receive approximately million of sublease income relating to this space  million for properties already sublet and million from properties where a sublet is anticipated 
we may not be able to sublet this space on the assumed terms and restoration costs may exceed our estimates 
if we are unable to sublet this space on the assumed terms  or if restoration costs exceed our estimates  there may be an adverse effect on our operating results of up to million resulting from additional restructuring costs 
our inability to rely on the statutory safe harbor as a result of the settlement of the securities and exchange commission investigation could harm our business 
effective january   we entered into a settlement with the sec as a result of an investigation against us 
pursuant to the settlement  we consented to the entry by the sec of an order instituting public 
table of contents administrative proceedings pursuant to section a of the securities act of and section c of the securities exchange act of  making findings  and imposing a cease and desist order 
pursuant to the order  we neither admitted nor denied the findings  except as to jurisdiction  contained in the order 
the order prohibits us from violating and causing any violation of the anti fraud provisions of the federal securities laws  for example by making materially false and misleading statements concerning our financial performance 
the order also prohibits us from violating or causing any violation of the provisions of the federal securities laws requiring us to file accurate quarterly and annual reports with the sec  maintain accurate accounting books and records  and maintain adequate internal accounting controls 
pursuant to the order  we are also required to cooperate in the sec s continuing investigation of other entities and persons 
in the event that we violate the order  we could be subject to substantial monetary penalties 
as a consequence of the issuance of the january order  we were not  for the three year period expiring on january   able to rely on the safe harbor for forward looking statements contained in the federal securities laws 
the safe harbor  among other things  limits potential legal actions against us in the event a forward looking statement concerning our anticipated performance turns out to be inaccurate  unless it can be proved that  at the time the statement was made  we actually knew that the statement was false 
if we become a defendant in any private securities litigation brought under the federal securities laws pertaining to that three year period  our legal position in the litigation could be materially adversely affected by our inability to rely on the safe harbor provisions for forward looking statements 
provisions in our charter documents may discourage potential acquisition bids and prevent changes in our management that our stockholders may favor 
this could adversely affect the market price for our common stock 
provisions in our charter documents could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control transaction that our stockholders may favor 
the provisions include elimination of the right of stockholders to act without holding a meeting  certain procedures for nominating directors and submitting proposals for consideration at stockholder meetings and a board of directors divided into three classes  with each class standing for election once every three years 
these provisions are intended to enhance the likelihood of continuity and stability in the composition of the board of directors and in the policies formulated by the board of directors and to discourage certain types of transactions involving an actual or threatened change of control 
these provisions are designed to reduce our vulnerability to an unsolicited acquisition proposal and  accordingly  could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control 
such provisions are also intended to discourage certain tactics that may be used in proxy fights but could  however  have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for shares of our common stock  and consequently  may also inhibit fluctuations in the market price of our common stock that could result from actual or rumored takeover attempts 
these provisions may also have the effect of preventing changes in our management 
in addition  we have adopted a rights agreement  commonly referred to as a poison pill  that grants holders of our common stock preferential rights in the event of an unsolicited takeover attempt 
these rights are denied to any stockholder involved in the takeover attempt which has the effect of requiring cooperation with our board of directors 
this may also prevent an increase in the market price of our common stock resulting from actual or rumored takeover attempts 
the rights agreement could also discourage potential acquirers from making unsolicited acquisition bids 

table of contents provisions in our charter documents with respect to undesignated preferred stock may discourage potential acquisition bids 
our board of directors is authorized to issue up to approximately four million shares of undesignated preferred stock in one or more series 
our board of directors can fix the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions of such preferred stock without any further vote or action by our stockholders 
however  the issuance of shares of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change in control transaction without further action by our stockholders

our current strategy contemplates future acquisitions  which will require us to incur substantial costs for which we may never realize the anticipated benefits 
our business strategy contemplates future acquisitions of complementary companies or technologies 
we cannot ensure that we will be able to implement our growth strategy  or that this strategy will ultimately be successful 
any potential acquisition may result in significant transaction expenses  increased interest and amortization expense  increased depreciation expense and increased operating expense  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results

the diversion of management attention and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve expected net sales  operating expenses and operating results for any acquired business 
we cannot ensure that we will realize any of the anticipated benefits of any acquisition  and if we fail to realize these anticipated benefits  our operating performance could suffer 
on november   we completed the acquisition of torrent  and on april  we completed the acquisition of vality 
we consummated each transaction with the expectation that it would result in mutual benefits including  among other things  expanded and complementary product offerings  increased market opportunity  new technology and the addition of strategic personnel 
achieving the benefits of the acquisitions will depend  in part  on the continued integration of our technology  operations and personnel in an efficient manner so as to minimize the risk that the acquisitions will result in the loss of market opportunity or key employees or the diversion of the attention of management 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful 
in addition  we cannot assure you that our business will achieve revenues  efficiencies or synergies or that the acquisitions will result in increased earnings for the combined company in any future period
