in the promotions area we offer a range of services  technology and expertise that enable large brands to quickly and easily create fun  innovative  interactive and customized marketing programs in conjunction with off line sales and marketing initiatives 
we work with leading brands and agencies to execute programs that help marketers engage customers  drive sales and leverage the ebay community through the exclusive marketing arrangement we entered into with ebay during the second quarter of our promotion solution is effective as either the central program concept for a rewards promotion using newly created points currency or as a value added redemption module for use with an existing loyalty program 
our auction and promotions platform can help optimize the return on investment on marketing and promotional budgets and lead to the creation of a higher quality customer database to assist future marketing initiatives 
we also utilize our technology  services and expertise in the commerce area to help large merchants maximize yield on clearance  excess and off lease inventory and to realize process efficiencies 
our solutions enable merchants to sell to their existing base of wholesale buyers or to buyers on ebay as well as to consumers on their own sites 
our technology is designed to enable our customers to leverage their existing inventory  transaction and fulfillment infrastructures by integrating seamlessly with those systems 
our services are used in four primary areas retail and discount clearance  promotions and interactive marketing  business to business surplus  and outsourced auctions and e commerce to portals and other web communities 
we provide a broad suite of dynamic pricing and points based formats  including auctions  our primary format  as well as fixed transaction formats for commerce and promotions  falling price formats for commerce  and integrated marketing capability  to create a comprehensive e business selling and marketing service offering 
we offer our commerce customers the ability to distribute their listings to other sites through two methods 
first  through our marketselect sm service  we enable customers with or without their own fairmarket hosted dynamic pricing site to list  manage and transact sales on ebay 
second  because we host our customer s dynamic pricing sites on our central systems  we have the ability to aggregate listings of goods and services available for sale on our customers fairmarket hosted sites and make those listings available for display and sale on other fairmarket hosted customer sites 
we provide an array of operational and support services to customers 
in addition to hosting  customer support and end user support services  our professional services group provides our customers with a range of business applications  technical customization  integration  e marketing  usability and other consulting services related to our product offerings 
we believe our success is dependent in large part on increasing our customer base and further enhancing the breadth and functionality of our service offerings  as well as on the volume of our customers sales on their fairmarket hosted sites and through our marketselect service 
we intend to continue to invest in the further enhancement of our service offerings and technology and in the promotion of our service offerings 
because of our limited operating history  there is limited operating and financial data about our business upon which to base an evaluation of our performance 
during  our net losses and negative operating cash flows improved during each quarter 
for  we expect our operating losses and negative operating cash flows to improve as we continue in our effort to achieve operating cash flow breakeven 
period to period comparisons of operating results should not be relied upon as an indicator of future operating results 
sources of revenue we derive revenue from application fees  which consist of implementation and fixed monthly hosting  support and operating fees  transaction fees  and professional services fees  which include fees for the development of business applications  technical customization and integration including as part of the implementation process  and e marketing  usability and other consulting services 
we generally charge a one time set up fee for the design  development and implementation of a customer s dynamic pricing or points based site or our marketselect service 
implementation also frequently entails customization and other professional services  for which we charge a professional services fee 
the set up fee and implementation related professional services fees vary depending on the nature and the anticipated complexity of the service being implemented 
these fees are generally payable upon execution of the contract  recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue  ratably  over the contract period 
fixed monthly fees are generally charged to customers whose dynamic pricing sites we host and cover hosting services  direct customer support services  end user customer support services  services for online billing and collection of fees for community sites and other monthly operating services 
fixed monthly fees vary by customer depending on the number of software modules employed  the required level of services and the anticipated level of site activity 
these fees are recognized as revenue in the month that the service is provided 
our professional services group offers our customers a range of business applications  technical customization  integration  e marketing  usability and other consulting services related to our product offerings for which we may charge either a one time or a monthly professional services fee  generally based on time and materials used  depending on the nature of the service 
these fees are generally recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue  ratably  over the contract period if the service provided is related to an ongoing service relationship  and are recognized as revenue in the period in which the service is provided if unrelated to an ongoing service relationship 
merchant customers  including marketselect customers  pay transaction fees at varying percentages based on the gross proceeds from the sale of their listed products and services  whether sold on their sites  on ebay or on other fairmarket network sites 
for community customers  transaction fees consist of our share of success fees charged to sellers upon a completed sale  listing fees  and enhanced listing fees  which are fees charged for the prominent display of a particular seller or listing such as under a list of featured merchants or featured listings 
community customers pay transaction fees calculated in one of two ways 
generally  under contracts entered into before  these fees are calculated based on a percentage of the gross proceeds from the sale of the items that are listed through the community site and sold either on the community site or on other fairmarket network sites 
the fee percentages vary by customer depending on the anticipated level of activity on the customer s site and the level of the fixed monthly fees 
these communities receive a percentage of the gross proceeds from the sale of items that are listed directly on other sites in the fairmarket network and sold through the community site 
contracts entered into starting in early generally provide for payment by the community customer of transaction fees with respect to the sale of listings that are placed on the community site that are calculated as a percentage of the percentage transaction fee that the community charges to its end users when the listing sells  similarly  for listings that are listed directly through other sites in the fairmarket network and sold through the community site  the community site receives a percentage of the percentage transaction fee that the listing site charges to the listing site s end user when the listing sells 
we record revenue net of amounts shared with our customers  which we recognize as revenue at the end of the listing period 
beginning in the second half of  we began to experience a shift in the nature of our revenue  from the fixed monthly fees we traditionally charge for hosting and maintaining customers sites  to transaction based fees 
we believe that this revenue shift is partly a result of recent economic conditions and pricing competition  and partly a result of an increasing portion of our customers using our marketselect service which we launched during the second quarter of  the fees for which are primarily transaction based 
we are uncertain if this shift from monthly fixed revenue to transaction revenue is permanent in nature 
revenue derived from promotions customers is primarily fixed in nature and we expect to experience an increase in revenue derived from promotions customers in the future 
revenues related to application fees represented approximately of total revenue in compared to in  revenues related to transaction fees represented approximately of total revenue in compared to in and professional services fee revenue represented approximately of total revenue in compared to in at no point during the sale process do we take possession of either the products being sold or the buyers payment for the item 
because merchants and individual sellers  rather than fairmarket  sell the items listed  we have no cost of goods sold  procurement  or carrying or shipping costs and no inventory risk related to the items sold 
critical accounting policies in december  the sec requested that all registrants discuss their most critical accounting policies in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the sec indicated that a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note  summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements included in this report  we believe the following accounting policies to be critical revenue recognition 
in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 we do not record revenue until all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  services have been rendered  our price to our customer is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we derive revenue from application fees  transaction fees and professional services fees 
application fees consist of implementation fees and fixed monthly hosting  support and operating fees 
we record implementation fees as deferred revenue and recognize these fees as revenue  ratably  over the contract period which approximates the life of our customer relationship 
we recognize fixed monthly hosting fees as revenue in the month that the service is provided 
we recognize transaction fees as revenue  net of amounts paid to our customers  at the completion of the listing period 
we record certain professional services fees related to ongoing service relationships as deferred revenue and recognize these fees as revenue ratably over the remaining contract period 
professional services fees which represent a separate earnings process and are unrelated to ongoing services are recognized as revenue in the period the service is provided 
we follow the guidance of emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer or a reseller of the vendor s products eitf in determining whether consideration  including equity instruments  given to a customer should be recorded as an operating expense or a reduction of revenue recognized from that same customer 
consideration given to a customer is recorded as a reduction of revenue unless both of the following conditions are met we receive an identifiable benefit in exchange for the consideration  and the identified benefit is sufficiently separable from the customer s purchase of the company s products and services such that the company could have purchased the products from a third party  and we can reasonably estimate the fair value of the benefit received 
if both of the conditions are met  we record consideration paid to customers as an expense 
consideration  including equity instruments  not meeting the above criteria  is recorded as a reduction of revenue  to the extent the company has recorded cumulative revenue from the customer or reseller 
any consideration in excess of cumulative revenue recognized from the customer or reseller is recorded as an operating expense 
identifying transactions that are within the scope of eitf  determining whether those transactions meet the criteria for recognition as an expense and determining the methodology of cost recognition associated with these arrangements requires us to make significant judgments 
if we reached different conclusions  reported revenue could be materially different 
allowance for doubtful accounts and revenue reserve when estimating our allowance for doubtful accounts  we analyze our accounts receivable aging  historical bad debts  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends and other factors 
if collection of accounts receivable is not reasonably assured  we establish a reserve for any revenue within the current reporting period for that customer and we charge bad debt expense for any revenue recognized in prior reporting periods for that customer 
deferred tax assets we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we consider future taxable income and tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  if management were to determine that the company would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would effect the provision for income taxes in the period such determination was made 
unutilized office space in the first quarter of  we recorded a one time charge of million for unutilized office space at our woburn  massachusetts headquarters 
this charge included rent and other related costs for a significant portion of our leased space which has been vacated for the remaining lease term and the write down of related leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures 
while we estimated the likelihood of future sublease income in the original charge  in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a reversal of  related to an additional sublease of approximately  square feet of the unutilized office space 
during  we charged  against this reserve  which represented rent payments related to the unutilized office space 
in addition we recorded million for the write down of leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures 
as of december   million of the total charge remained accrued and unpaid relating to future rent payments and other related costs 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring eitf 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
eitf allowed for an exit cost liability to be recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
sfas no 
also requires that liabilities recorded in connection with exit plans be initially measured at fair value 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december   with early adoption encouraged 
the company does not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation as originally provided by sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
additionally  sfas amends the disclosure requirements of sfas to require prominent disclosure in both the annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the transitional requirements of sfas will be effective for all financial statements for fiscal years ending after december  the disclosure requirements shall be effective for financial reports containing condensed financial statements for interim periods beginning after december  the company has adopted the disclosure portion of this statement for the year ending december  the company does not expect the adoption of fas will have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation  fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others an interpretation of fasb statements no 
  and and rescission of fasb interpretation no 
fin elaborates on the existing disclosure requirements for most guarantees  including loan guarantees such as standby letters of credit 
it also clarifies that at the time a company issues a guarantee  the company must recognize an initial liability for the fair value  or market value  of the obligations it assumes under the guarantee and must disclose that information in its interim and annual financial statements 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions apply on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the company is currently evaluating the impact that the initial recognition and measurement provisions of fin will have on its consolidated financial statements 
the disclosure provisions of fin are effective for this annual report on form k 
accordingly  the company has included a discussion of its guarantees in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in november  the emerging issues task force issued eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which it will perform multiple revenue generating activities 
eitf no 
establishes three principles revenue should be recognized separately for separate units of accounting  revenue for a separate unit of accounting should be recognized only when the arrangement consideration is reliably measurable and the earnings process is substantially complete  and consideration should be allocated among the separate units of accounting in an arrangement based on their fair values 
eitf no 
is effective for all revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june   with early adoption permitted 
we do not expect the adoption of eitf no 
to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb fin provides guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than through voting rights called variable interest entities or vies and how to determine when and which business enterprise should consolidate the vie the primary beneficiary 
this new model for consolidation applies to an entity which either the equity investors if any do not have a controlling financial interest or the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity s activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
in addition  fin no 
requires that both the primary beneficiary and all other enterprises with a significant variable interest in a vie make additional disclosures 
certain transitional disclosures are required in financial statements initially issued after january   if it is reasonably possible that once this guidance is effective the enterprise will either be required to consolidate a vie or will hold a significant variable interest in a vie 
we currently do not have any interests that would change our current reporting entity or require additional disclosures outlined in fin no 
results of operations for the years ended december   and for the years ended december   and  our net loss was million  million and million  respectively 
the reduction in net loss of million when comparing to was primarily due to a decrease in total operating expenses of million  partially offset by a decrease in revenue of million and a decrease in interest income of million 
the improvement in net loss of million from to was primarily due to a decrease in total operating expenses of million over such periods  partially offset by a decrease in revenue of million and a decrease in interest income of million 
revenue total revenue was million for compared to million in the decrease of million in revenue for compared to the prior year was due primarily to a reduction in the average revenue per customer and the decrease in the number of our customers described below 
application fees  which represented approximately of total revenue for compared to approximately of total revenue for  decreased by million  or  as compared to also reflected in these decreases was the effect of the revenue shift we began to experience during the second half of  from fixed monthly fees for hosting and maintaining customers sites to transaction based fees  and the percentage increase in the number of our customers that use our market select service  the fees for which are primarily transaction based 
transaction fees  which represented approximately of total revenue in compared to approximately of total revenue for  increased by  or  for as compared to we believe that this revenue shift is partly a result of recent economic conditions and pricing competition  and partly a result of an increasing portion of our customers using our marketselect service which we launched during the second quarter of  the fees for which are primarily transaction based 
professional services fees  which represented approximately of total revenue in  compared to approximately in  decreased by  or  for as compared to the prior year 
the decrease was due primarily to customer engagements being smaller in scale and shorter in duration when compared to the services provided in total revenue decreased to million in from million in the decrease in revenue of million is primarily due to the decrease in the number of our customers described below 
also contributing to the decrease was the effect of the revenue shift we began to experience in the second half of from fixed monthly fees for hosting and maintaining customers sites to transaction based fees  and the percentage increase in the portion of our customers that use our marketselect service  the fees for which are primarily transaction based 
in addition  revenue for the second half of included  in one time business development revenues 
the decrease in fixed monthly service revenue was partially offset by professional services revenue generated by our professional services group  which we formed in the fourth quarter of professional services revenue represented of total revenue in compared to of total revenue in international revenue was million  million and million or  and of total revenue  in  and  respectively 
in the first quarter of  we completed the closing our office in australia  and in the third quarter of we completed the closing of our office in germany 
we continue to service our existing australian customers out of our us operations and continue to assess our international strategy 
there are risks inherent in doing business internationally  including  among others  fluctuating currency exchange rates  differing legal and regulatory requirements and differing accounting practices 
we price  invoice and collect fees for our international services primarily in the currency of our local subsidiary 
to date  currency fluctuations have not had a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
the one time set up fees we charge for the implementation of customer sites and our marketselect service and implementation related professional services are deferred and recorded as revenue over the term of the related contracts 
at december   and  there was   and  of deferred revenue  respectively  relating to set up fees and   and  respectively  relating to professional services 
in  we added twenty four new customers and terminated twenty contracts  either by us or by the customer  ending with customers  a decrease of customers from customers at december  during  approximately customer contracts were terminated  either by us or by the customer  terminations by customers occurred primarily as a result of economic conditions that led in some cases to the customer ceasing operations and in other cases to the customer refocusing on other areas of their business 
during  approximately customer contracts were terminated  partially as a result of a general price increase that we effected in early and partially as a result of a shift in our sales focus away from outsourced e commerce for portals and traffic building applications for dot coms to providing demand chain sell side solutions  such as enabling the web based sale of retail and discount clearance items and business to business surplus and hosting interactive marketing promotions for larger retailers and manufacturers with higher brand awareness and greater financial resources 
average annual revenue per customer  excluding  of one time business development revenues in  was   and  for  and  respectively 
the decrease in average revenue was due primarily to a change in our mix of customers and the service offerings provided to those customers that used more transaction based services and less fixed price and professional services in compared to average revenue per customer for future periods will depend on a number of factors such as our customer mix  the mix of our service offerings  technological changes  our pricing strategies and pricing competition 
we had three customers in that each accounted for more than of total revenue  sam s west  inc accounted for  revenue from providing promotion services to burger king under our exclusive marketing agreement with the ebay  inc accounted for and microsoft corporation accounted for  of total revenue 
in and  no one customer accounted for more than of total revenue 
operating expenses cost of revenue cost of revenue was million in  million in and million in as a percentage of revenue  cost of revenue increased to in from in and from in cost of revenue consists of costs for direct customer support and support to end users of our customers sites  depreciation of network equipment  fees paid to network providers for bandwidth and monthly fees paid to third party network providers 
the decrease of million in compared to the same period last year was primarily due to a reduction in salaries and related expenses resulting from headcount reductions in the second and third quarters of and the second quarter of and a reduction in the fees paid to network providers for bandwidth 
in addition  we realized cost reductions by relocating our uk data center to our us data center 
cost of revenue reflected a reduction in salaries and related expenses in compared to resulting from the headcount reductions in the second and third quarters of  partially offset by the effect for the full year of costs related to the expansion of our us data center and the opening of international data centers in the uk and australia during  including depreciation of network equipment and fees paid for bandwidth and third party network providers 
during the second quarter of  we relocated our australia data center back to the us gross profit was  and of total revenue for  and  respectively 
this decrease in gross profit for and was primarily attributable to the decrease in revenue discussed above 
the gross profit reported above is not necessarily indicative of gross profit for future periods 
actual gross profit may vary significantly depending on  among other things  customer mix  product mix  price competition  technological changes and extraordinary costs 
our cost of revenue components are primarily fixed in nature and will continue to be fixed in the short term  as a result gross profit is largely based on revenue results 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses were million for compared to million in the decrease of million was due primarily due to the absence of amortization of million of an email marketing database which we purchased from at home corporation formerly known as excite  inc in the fourth quarter of for cash in connection with the termination of an auction services agreement which was amortized over its useful life in also contributing to the decrease in sales and marketing expenses was a reduction in salaries and related expenses of million  resulting from lower headcount and a reduction of  in marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses decreased to million in from million in the decrease of million in is primarily due to a reduction in amortization of advertising expenses of million related to advertising services purchased from at home corporation during under an auction services agreement which was terminated in december this decrease in amortization was partially offset by amortization expense of million during related to an email marketing database which we purchased from at home in december for cash in connection with the termination of the auction services agreement and amortized over its useful life in also contributing to the decrease in sales and marketing expenses was a reduction in marketing expenses of approximately million in compared to  primarily relating to the discontinuation of certain marketing programs during the fourth quarter of  a reduction in salaries and related expenses of million resulting from lower headcount and a  decrease in fees paid to outside contract service providers

as of december   million of the total reserve remained accrued and unpaid and relates to future rent payments and other related costs 
of this amount  million is expected to be recorded against this reserve over the next months and has been classified as a short term liability in the consolidated balance sheet 
equity related charges equity related charges consist of the amortization of deferred stock compensation resulting from the grant of stock options to employees at exercise prices subsequently deemed to be less than the fair value of the common stock on the grant date and the fair value of warrants issued to strategic customers and shares of series d convertible preferred stock issued to strategic customers at prices below their fair value

we expect to incur equity related compensation expense of at least  in at december   equity related charges on the consolidated balance sheet were net of million that we reversed through equity as a result of the relinquishment by microsoft of certain warrants discussed below  and net of amortization of million in  million in and million in equity related charges were amortized ratably over the terms of the related agreements of approximately three years after giving effect to the amendment of the microsoft agreement and termination of the original excite agreement discussed below 
interest income  net interest income was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease in interest income for and was due principally to lower average cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances during these periods as a result of cash used in operating activities and to a lesser extent a decrease in interest rates 
microsoft and excite contracts in june  we amended the auction services agreement that we entered into with microsoft in july  which originally provided that  if microsoft drove more than a specified number of internet users to the fairmarket network through its internet portal site  we would guarantee a minimum level of transaction fee revenue regardless of actual transaction fee revenue earned by microsoft 
under this provision  if microsoft met its minimum annual traffic guarantee but such increase in traffic did not produce sufficient revenue to meet the minimum guaranteed revenue  we would have had a financial obligation to microsoft equal to the difference between the minimum guaranteed payment and its portion of fees actually collected 
the minimum guaranteed revenue was million for the first contract year 
microsoft did not meet its minimum annual traffic guarantee for the first contract year and therefore no payment was required 
as part of the june amendment  this provision was eliminated from the auction services agreement 
also under the terms of the amendment  microsoft relinquished the warrants it held to purchase  shares of our common stock  which were issued in connection with the original july agreement with microsoft 
in exchange for the above  we waived our status as pre eminent auction services provider to microsoft s online properties

we believe  based on our present business plan  that our current cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and our cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for both the short term and long term

risks related to our business our business is difficult to evaluate  our business strategy may not successfully address risks we face and your basis for evaluating us is limited 
we were formed in february and we began to execute our current business model involving the offering of outsourced  private label auction solutions in december  which we have since expanded to include additional transaction pricing and points based promotions and distribution capabilities 
while a high percentage of our operating expenses have historically been  and are expected to continue to be  fixed in the short term  our operating expenses are largely based on unpredictable revenue trends 
because of our limited operating history  our business strategy may not successfully address all of the risks we face  and you have limited operating and financial data about our business upon which to base an evaluation of our performance 
we face the following risks  expenses and difficulties as a company seeking to develop a new internet based service if we fail to attract and retain quality customers we may be unable to generate sufficient revenue to support our business  if we fail to attract and retain qualified sales  engineering and other personnel we may be unable to maintain and expand our business  if we fail to maintain and upgrade our service offerings and technology to keep pace with the rapidly growing internet market we serve we may be unable to compete effectively  and if we fail to raise additional capital if and when we need it we may be unable to develop or sustain our business 
we expect to continue to incur substantial operating losses in the near future 
for the year ended december   we incurred a net loss of approximately million  which represented approximately of our revenue for the same period 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we have not achieved profitability and we will continue to incur net losses until we can produce sufficient revenues to cover our costs  which may not occur 
while it is our goal to achieve profitability  even if we achieve profitability  we may be unable to sustain or increase our profitability in the future because we intend to continue to invest in the further development of our service offerings and technology and in the promotion of our service offerings 
any such investment will depend on the availability of funds 
we expect to continue to have negative operating cash flow in the near future  and we may need to seek additional financing  which could be difficult to obtain 
we expect to continue to experience negative operating cash flows for the foreseeable future because we intend to continue to invest in the further enhancement of our service offerings and technology and in the promotion of our service offerings 
we expect that we will fund these expenditures primarily from available cash 
we believe  based on our present business plan  that our current cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and our cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for both the short term and long term 
if the assumptions underlying our business plan regarding future revenue and expenditures change or if unexpected opportunities or needs arise  including potential acquisitions using cash  we may find it necessary to obtain additional equity or debt financing 
if additional financing is required  we may not be able to raise it on acceptable terms or at all 
we may acquire other businesses or technologies  which could result in dilution to our stockholders  or operational or integration difficulties which could impair our financial performance 
if appropriate opportunities present themselves  we may acquire businesses  technologies  services or products that we believe will be useful in the growth of our business 
we do not currently have any commitments or agreements with respect to any acquisition 
we may not be able to identify  negotiate or finance any future acquisition successfully 
even if we do succeed in acquiring a business  technology  service or product  the process of integration may produce unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures and may require significant attention from our management that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development of our business 
moreover  we have not made any acquisitions  have no experience in integrating an acquisition into our business and may never achieve any of the benefits that we might anticipate from a future acquisition 
if we make future acquisitions  we may issue shares of stock that dilute other stockholders  incur debt or assume contingent liabilities  any of which might harm our financial results and cause our stock price to decline 
any financing that we might need for future acquisitions may only be available to us on terms that restrict our business or that impose on us costs that reduce our revenue 
we may not be able to continue to attract new customers or retain existing customers 
the success of our business model depends in large part on our ability to increase our number of customers and to retain existing customers 
the market for our services may grow more slowly than anticipated or become saturated with competitors  many of which may offer lower prices or broader distribution 
in addition  the sales cycle for larger brand companies  retailers and manufacturers  where we currently focus our sales efforts  is generally longer than for the smaller companies and e commerce companies that made up a larger part of our customer base in prior years 
we also believe that uncertain economic conditions during and have resulted in a longer decision making and implementation process with customers and during and led in many cases to customer contract terminations as a result of the customer ceasing operations or focusing on other areas of their business 
if we cannot continue to attract new customers on a timely basis or at all  or if we cannot maintain our existing customer base  our business and revenues would be adversely affected 
a loss of any client that accounts for a large portion of our revenues could cause our revenues to decline 
for  three of our customers accounted for approximately of total revenue 
if any one of these contracts is not renewed or otherwise terminates  and if we are unable to replace it with other client agreements  our revenues would decline and our losses would likely increase 
because our industry is highly competitive and has low barriers to entry  we may not be able to effectively compete 
the us market for e commerce services is extremely competitive 
we expect competition to intensify as current competitors expand their product offerings and new competitors enter the market 
in the surplus online auction market  in addition to competition from internally developed solutions by individual organizations  we face competition for customers from third party providers in the following areas third party online auction enablers  such as channeladvisor and auctionworks  that facilitate the distribution of listings to third party auction sites such as ebay and yahoo auctions  and in the online loyalty program market  in addition to competition from internally developed solutions by individual organizations  we face competition from third party providers in the following areas destination sites with loyalty auction programs  such as yahoo auctions  and third party loyalty program enablers such as softcoin  edeals and rocketcash who may extend their offerings to incorporate capabilities similar to those offered by our loyalty program service 
the principal competitive factors include price  quality and breadth of services provided and potential for successful transaction activity 
e commerce and marketing technology markets are characterized by rapidly changing technologies  changing requirements of customers and frequent new product and service introductions 
we may fail to introduce new online pricing formats and features on a timely basis or at all 
if we fail to introduce new service offerings or to improve our existing service offerings in response to industry developments  or if our prices are not competitive  we could lose customers  which could lead to a loss of revenues 
because there are relatively low barriers to entry in the e commerce market  competition from other established and emerging companies may develop in the future 
many of our competitors may also have well established relationships with our existing and prospective customers 
increased competition is likely to result  and in some cases has resulted  in fee reductions  reduced margins  longer sales cycles for our services and a decrease or loss of our market share  any of which could harm our business  operating results or financial condition 
many of our competitors have  and new potential competitors may have  more experience developing internet based software applications and integrated purchasing solutions  larger technical staffs  larger customer bases  more and longer standing distribution channels  greater brand recognition and greater financial  marketing and other resources than we have 
in addition  competitors may be able to develop products and services that are superior to ours or that achieve greater customer acceptance 
we cannot assure you that the e commerce solutions offered by our competitors now or in the future will not be perceived as superior to ours by either businesses or consumers 
our customers may not successfully increase transactions on their dynamic pricing sites 
beginning in the second half of  we began to experience a shift in the nature of our revenue  from the fixed monthly fees we traditionally charge for hosting and maintaining customers sites  to transaction based fees 
we believe that this revenue shift is partly a result of recent economic conditions and pricing competition  and partly a result of an increasing portion of our customers using our marketselect service which we launched during the second quarter of  the fees for which are primarily transaction based 
to the extent this revenue shift continues  our success will increasingly depend on increases in the amount of user traffic and the number of transactions on our customers fairmarket hosted sites or on ebay through our marketselect service 
for this to occur  our existing customers must drive sufficient numbers of users to their fairmarket hosted sites  they must devote sufficient resources to making their sites attractive to buyers and sellers and there must be demand for the products being offered on those sites and on ebay through our marketselect service 
we cannot assure you that our customers will be successful in accomplishing any of these objectives and their failure to do so could impede our growth and adversely affect our business and revenues 
our workforce reductions may impact our ability to attract or retain key personnel 
our future success will depend  in part  on attracting and retaining qualified personnel 
in late june  we eliminated positions worldwide  representing approximately of our total employee base 
previously  in  we implemented two workforce reductions in which we eliminated positions  and in we implemented a workforce reduction in which we eliminated positions 
we also experienced a number of management changes in the first half of and the first half of management changes during the first half of included the election of nanda krish as full time president and chief executive officer  the appointment of three new directors to our board of directors  and the resignations of our vice president of sales and marketing and our vice president of engineering 
we experienced some attrition in personnel prior to and following these workforce reductions and believe that we may experience additional attrition in the future 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in hiring or retaining qualified personnel 
our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel on a timely basis  or the departure of key employees  could harm our existing business and ability to expand or maintain our operations 
we may not be successful in international markets 
a component of our strategy has been to attract customers outside the us for the years ended december   and  revenue under contracts with customers outside the us primarily in the united kingdom represented approximately  and of our total revenue  respectively 
during  we opened offices in england  australia and germany 
we completed the closing of our office in germany during the third quarter of and the closing of our office in australia during the first quarter of we continue to service our australian customers out of our us operations 
we believe that significant opportunities exist in international markets  and we continue to evaluate our international strategy 
doing business in international markets requires significant management  financial  development  sales  marketing and other resources 
we have limited experience in localizing our services  and some of our competitors have expanded or are undertaking expansion into foreign markets 
we cannot assure you that we will expand into new  or continue our existing operations in  international markets or that we will be successful in international markets 
in addition to the uncertainty regarding our ability to generate revenues from foreign operations and expand or maintain our international presence  there are risks inherent in doing business internationally  including  among others different legal and regulatory requirements  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  longer payment cycles  different accounting practices  fluctuating currency exchange rates  problems in collecting accounts receivable  legal uncertainty regarding liability  ownership and protection of intellectual property  tariffs and other trade barriers  seasonal reductions in business activity  potentially adverse tax consequences  and political instability 
any of the above factors could adversely affect the success of our international operations 
to the extent we expand our international operations  we will become more exposed to the above risks 
to the extent we have increasing portions of our revenues denominated in foreign currencies  we will become subject to increased risks relating to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
we cannot assure you that one or more of the factors discussed above will not have a material adverse effect on our international operations and  consequently  on our results of operations and financial condition 
buyers and sellers might not adopt online auction or other dynamic pricing solutions as a means for buying and selling goods and services 
online auction and other dynamic pricing solutions are relatively new methods of buying and selling that market participants may not adopt at levels sufficient to sustain our business 
traditional purchasing is often based on long standing relationships or familiarity with sellers 
for online dynamic pricing solutions to succeed  buyers and sellers must adopt new purchasing practices 
buyers must be willing to rely less upon traditional relationships in making purchasing decisions  and businesses must be willing to offer products for sale through online dynamic pricing solutions 
we cannot assure you that online dynamic pricing solutions will be adopted at levels sufficient to sustain our business 
we may need to enter into strategic alliances or license technologies to expand our business or service offerings but may not be successful in doing so 
in addition to internal development of new technologies  our future success may depend to a certain degree on our ability to enter into and implement strategic alliances to expand our product and service offerings and our distribution channels and or to jointly market or gain market awareness for our service offerings 
for example  during the second quarter of we expanded our auction service in the us to provide customers with the opportunity to list  manage and transact sales through ebay 
in the second quarter of  we entered into an exclusive month agreement with ebay to provide our loyalty marketing program technology platform to third parties 
we may also expand our service offerings by licensing or purchasing complementary technologies from third parties 
for example  during the first quarter of we announced that we licensed certain real time e business infrastructure software from tibco software inc to enable us to provide real time messaging infrastructure 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in identifying  developing or maintaining such alliances and relationships or that such alliances and relationships will achieve their intended purposes 
others may assert that our technology infringes their intellectual property rights 
the e commerce industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and litigation based on allegations of patent infringement and violation of other intellectual property rights 
as the e commerce market and the functionality of products in the industry continues to grow and overlap  we believe that the possibility of intellectual property claims against us will increase 
for example  we may inadvertently infringe a patent of which we are unaware  or there may be patent applications now pending of which we are unaware which we may be infringing when they are issued in the future  or our service or systems may incorporate third party technologies that infringe the intellectual property rights of others 
we have been and expect to continue to be subject to alleged infringement claims 
the defense of any claims of infringement made against us by third parties  whether or not meritorious  could involve significant legal costs and require our management to divert time from our business operations 
either of these consequences of an infringement claim could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
if we are unsuccessful in defending any claims of infringement  we may be forced to obtain licenses or to pay royalties to continue to use our technology 
we may not be able to obtain any necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
if we fail to obtain necessary licenses or other rights  or if these licenses are costly  our operating results may suffer either from reductions in revenues through our inability to serve customers or from increases in costs to license third party technologies 
our business may suffer if we are not able to protect important intellectual property 
our ability to compete effectively against other companies in our industry will depend  in part  on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and systems designs 
while we have attempted to safeguard and maintain our proprietary rights  we cannot assure you that we have been or will be completely successful in doing so 
further  our competitors may independently develop or patent technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to ours 
we have applied for patents on aspects of our technology and processes and those applications are pending with the us patent and trademark office 
we cannot assure you that any patents will be issued 
even if some or all of these patents are issued  we cannot assure you that they will not be successfully challenged by others or invalidated  that they will adequately protect our technology and processes or that they will result in commercial advantages for us 
fairmarket is a registered service mark in the us we have applied for trademark registrations for some of our other brand names  and our marketing materials are copyrighted  but these protections may not be adequate 
effective patent  trademark  service mark  copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country where we provide services 
we may  at times  have to incur significant legal costs and spend time defending our copyrights and  if issued  our service marks and patents 
any defense efforts  whether successful or not  would divert both time and resources from the operation and growth of our business 
we may not be able to maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary knowledge 
we rely  in part  on contractual provisions to protect our trade secrets and proprietary knowledge 
these agreements may be breached  and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach 
our trade secrets may also be known without breach of such agreements or may be independently developed by competitors 
our inability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology could harm our business  results of operations and financial condition by adversely affecting our ability to compete 
our business may be adversely affected if we are unable to continue to license software that is necessary for our service offering 
through distributors  we license a variety of commercially available microsoft technologies  including our database software and internet server software  which is used in our services and systems to perform key functions 
we also license other third party technology to perform certain functions of our service  such as our search functionality  which utilizes technology from verity  inc  and technology that we license from tibco software inc  which we use in certain of our integration solutions 
as a result  we are to a certain extent dependent upon those third parties continuing to maintain their technologies 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to replace the functionality provided by these third party technologies on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
the absence of or any significant delay in the replacement of certain functionalities could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our systems infrastructure may not keep pace with the demands of our customers 
interruptions of service as a result of a high volume of traffic and or transactions could diminish the attractiveness of our services and our ability to attract and retain customers 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to accurately project the rate or timing of increases  if any  in the use of our service  or that we will be able to expand and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to accommodate such increases in a timely manner 
we currently maintain separate systems in the us for our us  us and australia services 
any failure to expand or upgrade our systems could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition by reducing or interrupting revenue flow and by limiting our ability to attract new customers 
any such failure could also have a material adverse effect on the business of our customers  which could damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and potential liability 
the majority of the server capacity of our systems for each of the countries named above is currently not utilized 
a system failure could cause delays or interruptions of service to our customers 
service offerings involving complex technology often contain errors or performance problems 
many serious defects are frequently found during the period immediately following introduction and initial implementation of new services or enhancements to existing services 
although we attempt to resolve all errors that we believe would be considered serious by our customers before implementation  our systems are not error free 
errors or performance problems could result in lost revenues or cancellation of customer agreements and may expose us to litigation and potential liability 
we have from time to time discovered errors in our software or software of others used in our operating systems after its incorporation into our systems 
we cannot assure you that undetected errors or performance problems in our existing or future services will not be discovered or that known errors considered minor by us will not be considered serious by our customers 
we have experienced periodic minor system interruptions  which may continue to occur from time to time 
most of our contracts provide for the payment or credit to the customer of specified money damages based on the monthly service fee paid by the customer if we are unable to maintain specified levels of service based on downtime of either their fairmarket hosted sites or our centralized service over a specified period  typically one month 
the total dollar amount of our potential payment or credit obligations under these provisions if the service levels specified in all of those agreements were not met over the typical one month measurement period could be material 
in addition  certain of our contracts also provide the customer with the right to terminate the contract if we are unable to maintain a minimum specified level of service 
performance problems in our technology could also damage our reputation  which could reduce market acceptance of our services and lead to a loss of revenues 
the functioning of our systems or the hosting facilities of third parties on which we rely could be disrupted by factors outside our control 
our success depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer and communications hardware systems 
substantially all of our computer hardware for operating our us  us and australia services is currently located at the facilities of navisite  inc in andover  massachusetts 
the computer hardware for our end user customer service system is also hosted by a third party 
these systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters  fires  power loss  telecommunication failures  break ins  sabotage  computer viruses  intentional acts of vandalism  acts of terrorism and similar events 
all of our systems are located in the same facility and we do not currently have a backup system in place for any of these systems 
despite any precautions we take or plan to take  the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unanticipated problems at any third party hosting facility could result in interruptions in our services 
in addition  if any third party hosting service fails to provide the data communications capacity we require  as a result of human error  natural disaster or other operational disruption  interruptions in our service could result 
any damage to or failure of our systems could result in reductions in  or terminations of  our service  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our business may suffer if buyers and sellers do not make payments or deliver goods 
our success may depend to some extent upon sellers on customer sites reliably delivering and accurately representing their listed goods and buyers paying the agreed purchase price 
our customers have received in the past  and we anticipate that they will receive in the future  communications from sellers and buyers who did not receive the purchase price or the goods that were to have been exchanged 
neither we nor our customers have the ability to require end users to make payments or deliver goods or otherwise make end users whole 
our customers also periodically receive complaints from buyers as to the quality of the goods purchased 
we are unaware of any complaints that have materially impacted our customers businesses in a detrimental manner 
neither we nor our customers have the ability to determine the level of such complaints that are made directly between buyers and sellers 
we expect that both we and our customers will continue to receive requests from end users requesting reimbursement or threatening legal action against either our customers or us if no reimbursement is made 
we may have to monitor or control activities on customer sites 
the law relating to the liability of providers of online services for the activities of users of their services is currently unsettled in the us and in other countries 
our service automatically screens by key word all listings submitted by end users for pornographic material 
we also have notice and take down procedures related to infringing and illegal goods 
these procedures are not foolproof and goods that may be subject to regulation by us local  state or federal authorities or local foreign authorities could be sold through our service 
these goods include  for example  firearms  alcohol and tobacco 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to prevent the unlawful exchange of goods on our service or that we will successfully avoid civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities carried out by users through our service 
the potential imposition of liability for unlawful activities of end users of our customers could require us to implement measures to reduce our exposure to such liability  which may require us  among other things  to spend substantial resources and or to discontinue one or more of our service offerings 
any costs incurred as a result of such liability or asserted liability would harm our results of operations 
future government regulation of auctions and auctioneers may add to our operating costs 
numerous us jurisdictions have laws and regulations regarding the conduct of auctions and the liability of auctioneers  which were enacted for consumer protection many years ago 
we believe that the us laws and regulations do not apply to our online auction services 
however  little precedent exists in this area  and one or more jurisdictions in the us or in other countries in which we do business are attempting or may attempt to impose these laws and regulations to online auction providers and may attempt to impose these laws and regulations on our operations or the operations of our customers in the future 
certain states are currently considering whether to apply their auctioneer regulations to online auctions and at least one state has passed legislation that applies to the conduct of all auctions  including auctions conducted over the internet 
if any such statute or regulation is interpreted to apply to us or to our customers  we and or those of our customers to whom the statute applies could be required to obtain a license 
this could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers  could adversely affect our results of operations by decreasing activity on our customers auction sites and could subject us or our customers to fines if we or our customers are unable to obtain the required licenses 
in addition  as the nature of the products listed by our customers or their end users changes  we may become subject to new regulatory restrictions 
if we do become subject to these laws and regulations in the future  it could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers and could adversely affect our results of operations by decreasing activity on our customers fairmarket hosted sites 
future sales of our common stock could adversely affect our stock price 
a substantial portion of our common stock is held by a small number of investors and can be resold or is subject to registration rights 
sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market  or the perception that a large number of shares are available for sale  could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
in addition to the adverse effect a price decline could have on holders of our common stock  such a decline would likely impede our ability to raise capital through the issuance of additional shares of our common stock or other equity securities 
such a decline could also cause our common stock to trade at a per share price of less than which could lead to a delisting of our common stock from nasdaq 
the holders of approximately  shares of our common stock including at least  shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of shares of series b preferred stock  have rights  subject to some conditions  to require us to file registration statements covering their shares  or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for fairmarket or other stockholders 
pursuant to the exercise of these rights  we have registered the resale of  shares of our common stock on a form s registration statement 
by selling a large number of shares  these holders could cause the price of our common stock to decline 
furthermore  if we were to include in a fairmarket initiated registration statement shares held by those holders pursuant to the exercise of their registration rights  those sales could impair our ability to raise needed capital by depressing the price at which we could sell our common stock 
risks related to our industry our success depends on the continued growth of the internet and online commerce 
our future revenues and profits depend upon the widespread acceptance and use of the internet and other online services as a medium for commerce by businesses and consumers 
the use of the internet and e commerce may not continue to develop at past rates and a sufficiently broad base of business and individual customers may not adopt or continue to use the internet as a medium of commerce 
the market for the sale of goods and services over the internet is an emerging market 
demand and market acceptance for online services and for the sale of goods and services over the internet are subject to a high level of uncertainty 
growth in our customer base depends on obtaining businesses and consumers who have historically used traditional means of commerce to purchase goods and services 
for us to be successful  these market participants must accept and use novel ways of conducting business and exchanging information 
e commerce may not prove to be a viable medium for purchasing for the following reasons  any of which could seriously harm our business the necessary infrastructure for internet communications may not develop adequately  our potential customers  buyers and suppliers may have security and confidentiality privacy concerns  complementary products  such as high speed modems and high speed communication lines  may not be developed  alternative purchasing solutions may be implemented  buyers may dislike the reduction in the human contact inherent in traditional purchasing methods  use of the internet and other online services may not continue to increase or may increase more slowly than expected  the development or adoption of new technology standards and protocols may be delayed or may not occur  and new and burdensome governmental regulations may be imposed 
our success depends on the continued reliability of the internet 
the internet continues to experience significant growth in the number of users  frequency of use and bandwidth requirements 
we cannot assure you that the infrastructure of the internet and other online services will be able to support the demands placed upon them 
furthermore  the internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damage to portions of its infrastructure  and could face such outages and delays in the future 
these outages and delays could adversely affect the level of internet usage and also the level of traffic and the processing of transactions 
in addition  the internet or other online services could lose their viability due to delays in the development or adoption of new standards and protocols required to handle increased levels of internet or other online service activity  or due to increased governmental regulation 
changes in or insufficient availability of telecommunications services or other internet service providers to support the internet or other online services also could result in slower response times and adversely affect usage of the internet and other online services generally and our service in particular 
if use of the internet and other online services does not continue to grow or grows more slowly than expected  if the infrastructure of the internet and other online services does not effectively support growth that may occur  or if the internet and other online services do not become a viable commercial marketplace  we will have to adapt our business model to the new environment  which would materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
government regulation of the internet may impede our growth or add to our operating costs 
like many internet based businesses  we operate in an environment of tremendous uncertainty as to potential government regulation 
the internet has rapidly emerged as a commerce medium  and governmental agencies have not yet been able to adapt all existing regulations to the internet environment 
laws and regulations have been introduced or are under consideration and court decisions have been or may be reached in the us and other countries in which we do business that affect the internet or other online services  covering issues such as pricing  user privacy  freedom of expression  access charges  content and quality of products and services  advertising  intellectual property rights and information security 
in addition  it is uncertain how existing laws governing issues such as taxation  property ownership  copyrights and other intellectual property issues  libel  obscenity and personal privacy will be applied to the internet 
the majority of these laws were adopted prior to the introduction of the internet and  as a result  do not address the unique issues of the internet 
recent laws that contemplate the internet  such as the digital millennium copyright act in the us  the european union electronic commerce directive the electronic commerce directive and the european union directive on copyright in the information society copyright directive  have not yet been fully interpreted by the courts and their applicability is therefore uncertain 
the digital millennium copyright act provides certain safe harbors that limit the risk of copyright infringement liability for service providers such as fairmarket with respect to infringing activities engaged in by users of the service  such as end users of our customers dynamic pricing sites 
we have adopted policies and practices to qualify for one or more of these safe harbors  but we cannot assure you that our efforts will be successful since the digital millennium copyright act has not been fully interpreted by the courts and its interpretation is therefore uncertain 
the european union electronic commerce directive has already been implemented in the united kingdom  spain and germany 
other member states should also be implementing this directive in due course 
the uk electronic commerce ec directive regulations contain informational requirements for online sellers  requirements for electronic communications and concluding contracts online and provisions limiting the liability of service providers for unlawful content in certain instances 
these regulations may affect our operations in the uk if our customers or we  as applicable  do not adequately update our respective practices to comply with the new uk regulations implementing this directive 
legislation implementing the directive in other member states may similarly affect us or our customers 
in australia  recent amendments have been made to the copyright act to regulate copyright issues arising in the context of the internet 
in addition  the broadcasting services act has been recently amended to establish a notice and take down procedure with respect to offensive or obscene content 
these amendments provide specific immunities and or defenses for internet service providers 
however  the full application of these immunities and defenses has not yet been tested 
the european union copyright directive attempts to harmonize copyright in areas of digital transmission but has yet to be implemented in the member states across europe including the uk although member states should have implemented the copyright directive by december   this has not yet taken place 
however implementation by member states is expected to occur in the near future and this may impact on our and our customer s business 
in the area of user privacy  several states have proposed legislation that would limit the uses of personal user information gathered online or require online services to establish privacy policies 
the federal trade commission also has become increasingly involved in this area  and recently settled an action with one online service regarding the manner in which personal information is collected from users and provided to third parties 
the european union directive on the protection of personal data  as implemented in the relevant member states  may affect our operations in the uk if we or our customers do not afford adequate privacy to end users of our customers sites 
additionally  the recently adopted european union directive on protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector  when implemented in the relevant member states  may also affect our operations in the uk if we  or our customers  do not update our policies and practices accordingly 
this directive contains a number of provisions regulating unsolicited communications  including email 
member states have until october to implement this directive 
the australian privacy amendment privacy sector act  which has an exemption for certain types of small businesses  became effective in december and may have a similar effect 
we do not sell personal user information from our customers sites 
generally  as between fairmarket and our customers  the personal user information belongs to the customer  not fairmarket  and each site is governed by the respective customer s own privacy policy 
we do use aggregated data for analyses regarding our services  and do use personal user information in the performance of our services for our customers 
since we do not control what our customers do with the personal user information they collect  we cannot assure you that our customers sites will be considered compliant 
as online commerce evolves  we expect that federal  state or foreign agencies will adopt regulations covering issues such as pricing  content  user privacy  hosting liability and quality of products and services 
any future regulation may have a negative impact on our business by restricting our methods of operation or imposing additional costs 
although many of these regulations may not apply to our business directly  we anticipate that laws regulating the solicitation  collection or processing of personal information could indirectly affect our business 
title v of the telecommunications act of  known as the communications decency act of  prohibited the knowing transmission of any comment  request  suggestion  proposal  image or other communication that is obscene or pornographic to any recipient under the age of substantial portions of the communications decency act of regarding such communications have been held to be unconstitutional 
subsequent similar legislation  know as the child online protection act  designed to comport with the constitutional concerns articulated by the supreme court  has been enacted  however  the constitutionality of that legislation is currently being litigated as well 
as such  the prohibition s scope and the liability associated with a violation are currently unsettled 
in addition  we cannot be certain that similar legislation will not be enacted and upheld in the future 
it is possible that such legislation could expose companies involved in online commerce to liability  which could limit the growth of online commerce generally 
legislation like the communications decency act could reduce the growth in internet usage and decrease its acceptance as a communications and commerce medium 
the worldwide availability of internet web sites often results in sales of goods to buyers outside the jurisdiction in which we or our customers are located  and foreign jurisdictions may claim that we or our customers are required to comply with their laws 
as an internet company  it is unclear which jurisdictions may find that we are conducting business therein 
our failure to qualify to do business in a jurisdiction that requires us to do so could subject us to fines or penalties and could result in our inability to enforce contracts in that jurisdiction 
regulation of promotional programs and email marketing may restrict our operations or increase our operating costs 
we offer to our customers a variety of promotional and incentive programs including coupon and rebate programs as well as sweepstakes  contests and other games 
these types of programs are subject to a variety of federal  state and local laws and regulations 
some of these states  including new york  florida  rhode island and arizona  require that sponsors of certain types of sweepstakes and contests register with the state and provide a bond to secure the prizes 
in addition  a number of states have special disclosure and registration requirements for promotions offered in connection with certain industries  such as alcohol  gasoline  and milk or offered in conjunction with a charitable organization 
in addition  marketing via email continues to be an area of focus for both federal and state legislatures  and regulators 
presently  more than half the states have statutes regulating the sending of emails 
many of these states provide exemptions if the email is being sent to existing customers or to people who have consented to receive the emails 
more states have legislation pending  some of which propose the establishment of an email do not solicit program  similar to the various state do not call programs established for solicitations via telemarketing 
these and the other applicable laws and regulations are very detailed and require extensive disclosures to consumers 
however  some of the laws are conflicting or out of date 
in addition  the applicable laws  cases and interpretations are often vague  inconsistent or incomplete and are subject to continual reinterpretation by attorneys general and other regulators 
furthermore  at almost all times there are relevant administrative rules or legislation pending which may become effective after a promotion commences making timely compliance extremely difficult 
these laws and regulations could have a material impact on our business by restricting our method of operations or imposing additional compliance costs 
new taxes may be imposed on internet commerce 
in the us  we do not collect sales or other similar taxes on goods sold by customers and users through customers fairmarket powered sites or service taxes on fees paid by end users of those sites 
the internet tax freedom act of  which was extended through november  by the internet tax non discrimination act  prohibits the imposition of taxes on internet access services and new taxes on electronic commerce by us federal and state taxing authorities 
if the moratorium is not extended past the november  deadline  states may seek to impose sales tax collection obligations on out of state companies which engage in or facilitate online commerce  and a number of proposals previously have been made at the state and local level that would impose additional taxes on the sale of goods and services through the internet 
such proposals  if adopted  could substantially impair the growth of electronic commerce  and could adversely affect our opportunity to derive financial benefit from such activities 
many non us countries impose service tax such as value added tax collection obligations on companies that engage in or facilitate internet commerce 
we do not collect sales or other similar taxes on goods sold by customers and or users of our customers sites in australia or the uk  it being the responsibility of our customers to do so if required 
our systems in each of those countries do enable value added or goods and services taxes to be charged and collected with respect to site usage fees  the determination of which is also the responsibility of our customers 
a successful assertion by one or more states or any foreign country that we rather than our customers should collect sales or other taxes on the exchange of merchandise or site usage fees or other internet based taxes or any failure of our customers to collect any such taxes if required to do so could impair our revenue and our ability to acquire and retain customers 
there may be significant security risks and privacy concerns relating to online commerce 
a significant barrier to online commerce and communications is the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks 
a compromise or breach of the technology used to protect our customers and their end users transaction data could result from  among other things  advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries in the field of cryptography  or other events or developments 
any such compromise could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and  therefore  on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
furthermore  a party who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in our operations 
we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against such security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches 
concerns over the security of transactions conducted on the internet and other online services and the privacy of users may also inhibit the growth of the internet and other online services generally  especially as a means of conducting commercial transactions 
we currently have practices and procedures in place to protect the confidentiality of our customers and their end users information 
however  our security procedures to protect against the risk of inadvertent disclosure or intentional breaches of security might fail to adequately protect information that we are obligated to keep confidential 
we may not be successful in adopting more effective systems for maintaining confidential information  and our exposure to the risk of disclosure of the confidential information of others may grow with increases in the amount of information we possess 
to the extent that our activities involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information  such as credit card numbers  security breaches could damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability 
our insurance policies may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches 
we could be subject to potential product liability claims and third party liability claims related to products and services purchased through our customers sites 
any errors  defects or other performance problems in our services and systems could result in financial or other damages to our customers 
although our agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to claims  existing or future laws or unfavorable judicial decisions could negate these limitation of liability provisions 
in addition  we may not be able to successfully avoid civil or criminal liability for problems related to the products and services sold on customer sites 
even if we are successful  any such claims or litigation could still require expenditure of management time and other resources to defend ourselves 
liability of this sort could require us to implement measures to reduce our exposure to this liability  which may require us  among other things  to expend substantial resources or to discontinue service offerings or to take precautions to ensure that certain products and services are not available on customer sites 
moreover  deliveries of products purchased on customer sites that are nonconforming  late or are not accompanied by information required by applicable law or regulations  could expose us to liability or result in decreased adoption and use of those sites and therefore our services  which would lead to decreased revenue 
our stock price is likely to be highly volatile 
the stock market  and in particular the market for internet related stocks  has  from time to time  experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
many factors may cause the market price for our common stock to decline  perhaps substantially  including failure to meet our development plans  the demand for our common stock  changes in general market conditions  technological innovations by competitors or in competing technologies  and investor perception of our industry or our prospects 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk investment portfolio we do not use derivative financial instruments for investment purposes and only invest in financial instruments that meet high credit quality standards  as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
this policy also limits the amount of credit exposure of any one issue  issuer  and type of investment 
due to the conservative nature of our investments  we do not believe that we have a material exposure to interest rate risk 
foreign currency risk international sales are made from our foreign sales subsidiaries in the respective countries and are denominated in the local currency of each country 
these subsidiaries also incur most of their expenses in the local currency 
accordingly  all foreign subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency 
our international business is subject to risks typical of an international business  including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
our intercompany accounts are typically denominated in the functional currency of the foreign subsidiary in order to centralize foreign exchange risk with the parent company in the united states 
we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall financial results 
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on fairmarket in the years ended december   and was not significant
