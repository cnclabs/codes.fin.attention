item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties 
words such as believes  expects  anticipates and the like indicate forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements include comments related to our projected revenue  gross margin  operating expense  income tax expense  effective tax rate and cash balances  our projected customer requirements for new capacity and technology upgrades for our installed base of thin film disk manufacturing equipment and when  and if  our customers will place orders for these products  our plans to construct a model shop and the projected use for the model shop  ptd s ability to proliferate its technology into major military weapons programs  and the timing of delivery and or acceptance of our backlog for revenue 
intevac s actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements for a variety of reasons  including those set forth under certain factors which may affect future operating results and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
we review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  accounts receivable  inventories  income taxes  warranty obligations  long lived assets  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities 
results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions 
the audit committee and our auditors review significant estimates and judgements at the end of each quarter prior to the public release of our financial results 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates made in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue using guidance from sec staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition in financial statements 
our policy allows revenue recognition when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
on january   intevac changed its revenue recognition policy for system orders received after december  system revenue recognition for orders received before revenues for systems are recognized upon customer acceptance 
for large deposition and rapid thermal processing systems shipped through a distributor  revenue is typically recognized after the distributor has accepted the system at our factory and the system has been shipped 
for large deposition and rtp systems sold direct to end customers  revenue is recognized after installation and acceptance of the system at the customer site 
there is a written acceptance and test procedure atp for each system  which is specified in the customer purchase order 
the atp includes a detailed set of criteria that are required as a condition of customer acceptance 
the atp is typically conducted over one or more days during which the system is subjected to a number of tests to validate that the system is performing in a repeatable fashion  reliably and to specification 
if material issues or problems are discovered during the atp process  then they are corrected prior to customer acceptance 

table of contents in the case of a direct end user sale  there are typically two atp s performed 
the first atp is performed at intevac s factory and must be approved by the customer prior to shipment of the system 
the second atp is performed after the system has been installed at the customer s factory  again with the customer in attendance 
once the second atp is approved by the customer  and the customer has accepted the system in writing and agreed to make any remaining payments due on the system  then the system is recognized as a sale and revenue for the entire system is recorded 
in the case of a shipment through a distributor  an atp is performed at intevac s factory 
upon completion of the atp  and after the distributor has accepted the system in writing and agreed to make any remaining payments due on the system  then the system is shipped and revenue for the entire system is recorded 
the distributor then completes customer factory installation and the atp at its cost 
when we believe that there may be higher than normal end user installation and acceptance issues for systems shipped through a distributor  such as when a major new version of a product is delivered for the first time  then the acceptance and revenue recognition process follows the model described above for a direct end user sale 
the primary difference in this case is that revenue recognition is dependent on intevac obtaining acceptance of the product by both our customer the distributor and our distributor s customer the end user 
during the period that a system is undergoing customer acceptance either distributor or end user  the value of the system remains in inventory  and any payments received  or amounts invoiced  related to the system are included in customer advances 
when revenue is recognized on the system  the inventory is charged to cost of net revenues  the customer advance is liquidated and the customer is billed for the unpaid balance of the system revenue 
as of december  the company reported million of finished goods see inventories  which consisted of five capacity upgrades to flat panel display fpd deposition systems undergoing final acceptance testing at the end user s facility and a fpd silicon deposition system undergoing final acceptance testing at the end user s facility 
taken as a whole  the above systems represent million of the company s million order backlog  and million of the company s million of customer advances see consolidated balance sheets 
system revenue recognition for orders received after certain of intevac s product sales with customer acceptance provisions are accounted for as multiple element arrangements 
if the company has met previously defined customer acceptance experience levels with the specific type of equipment  then intevac recognizes revenue for the fair market value of the equipment upon shipment and transfer of title and recognizes revenue for the fair market value of installation and acceptance services when those services are completed 
for products that have not been demonstrated to meet product specifications prior to shipment  revenue is recognized at customer acceptance 
in the event that intevac s customer chooses not to complete installation and acceptance  and intevac s obligations under the contract to complete installation  acceptance or any other tasks with the exception of warranty obligations have been fully discharged  then intevac recognizes any remainder revenue to the extent that collectibility under the contract is reasonably assured 
for contracts with end user customer acceptance provisions established prior to  intevac has deferred all revenue recognition until completion of installation and customer acceptance 
the revenue recognition policy outlined above and implemented for system orders received after december  was made to better conform intevac s revenue recognition policies to industry accounting practice for companies selling similar equipment 
the effect of adopting this policy in years prior to would have been no change in revenues  a decrease in revenues of million and an increase of revenues of million 
the effect on net income of adopting this policy in years prior to would have been no effect in net income  a decrease in net income of  and an increase in net income of  other systems and non system revenue recognition revenues for systems without installation and acceptance provisions  technology upgrades  spare parts  consumables and prototype products built by ptd are generally recognized upon shipment 
service and 
table of contents maintenance contract revenue  which to date has been insignificant  is recognized ratably over applicable contract periods or as the service is performed 
our shipping terms are customarily fob shipping point 
for systems sold directly to the end user  our obligations remaining after shipment typically include installation  end user factory acceptance and warranty 
for systems sold to distributors  typically the distributor assumes responsibility for installation and end user customer acceptance 
in some cases  the distributor will assume some or all of the warranty liability 
for products other than systems and system upgrades  warranty is the only obligation we have after shipment 
technology development revenue recognition we perform best efforts research and development work under various government sponsored research contracts 
typically  for each contract  we commit to perform certain research and development efforts up to an agreed upon amount 
in connection with these contracts  we receive funding on an incremental basis up to a ceiling 
some of these contracts are cost sharing in nature  where intevac is reimbursed for a portion of the total costs expended 
revenue on these contracts is recognized in accordance with contract terms  typically as costs are incurred 
in addition  we have  from time to time  negotiated with a third party to fund a portion of our costs in return for a joint interest in our technology rights developed pursuant to the contract 
in the event that total cost incurred under a particular contract over runs its agreed upon amount  we may be liable for the additional costs 
these contracts are accounted for under arb no 
 chapter  section a  which addresses cost plus fixed fee contracts 
the contracts are all cost type  with financial terms that are a mixture of fixed fee  incentive fee  no fee and cost sharing 
the deliverables under each contract range from providing reports to providing prototype hardware 
in none of the contracts is there an obligation for either party to continue the program once the funds have been expended 
the efforts can be terminated at any time for convenience  in which case we would be reimbursed for our actual incurred costs  plus fee  if applicable  for the completed effort 
we own the entire right  title and interest to each invention discovered under the contract  unless we specifically give up that right 
the us government has a paid up license to use any invention intellectual property for government purposes only 
inventories we make provisions for potentially excess and obsolete inventory based on backlog and forecasted demand 
however  order backlog is subject to revisions  cancellations  and rescheduling 
actual demand will inevitably differ from forecasted demand due to a number of factors 
for example  the disk industry has suffered from over capacity and poor financial results  which has led to industry consolidation 
consolidation can lead to the availability of used equipment that competes at very low prices with our products 
financial stress and consolidation in our customer base can also lead to the cancellation of orders for products after we have incurred substantial costs related to those orders 
such problems have resulted  and may continue to result  in excess and obsolete inventory  and the provision of related reserves 
warranty the company s standard warranty is twelve months from customer acceptance 
during this warranty period any necessary non consumable parts are supplied and installed 
a provision for the estimated warranty cost is recorded at the time revenue is recognized 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 

table of contents when we determine that the carrying value of long lived assets  intangibles or goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
results of operations net revenues 
net revenues consist primarily of sales of equipment used to manufacture thin film disks  equipment used to manufacture flat panel displays  related equipment and system components  and contract research and development related to the development of electro optical devices and systems 
net revenues totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
equipment products division epd revenues totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
epd revenues decreased in due to a decrease in sales of flat panel manufacturing systems and disk system upgrades and components  partially offset by an increase in sales of disk manufacturing systems 
epd revenues increased in from due to an increase in sales of flat panel manufacturing systems  partially offset by a decrease in sales of disk manufacturing systems  disk systems upgrades and components 
epd delivered  and recognized revenue on  five of its d star deposition systems during during epd delivered upgrades to the five systems and one new d star system 
revenue recognition on the five upgrades and one new system was pending final customer acceptance at december  net revenues for and include million and million  respectively  of sales of rapid thermal processing equipment  a product line the company sold in november there were no sales of rapid thermal processing equipment in epd s fabrication center  which manufactured machined parts  contributed sales to outside customers of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the fabrication center was closed in september epd plans to replace the fabrication center with a smaller model shop during the model shop will manufacture engineering prototypes and parts for use in our products 
the disk manufacturing industry has now consolidated into a small number of large manufacturers 
we believe that the majority of our active customers now utilize most of their capacity and that there is significant potential for these customers to both resume adding capacity and to upgrade the technical capability of their installed base to permit production of high density disks for perpendicular recording rather than the current longitudinal technology 
however  we are not able to accurately predict when our customers will begin placing significant equipment orders again  or if they will place those orders with us  and this subjects us to a high degree of uncertainty in projecting our revenue 
photonics technology division ptd revenues totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
ptd revenues decreased in as a result of a decrease in revenues from contract research and development 
ptd revenues increased in over as the result of increased revenues from contract research and development 
ptd revenues in are expected to be primarily derived from contract research and development  but with some increase in revenue from livar target identification systems 
substantial growth in future ptd revenues is dependent on ptd proliferating its technology into major military weapons programs and obtaining production subcontracts for these programs 
the commercial imaging division cid was formed in july with the charter of developing commercial products based on ptd technology 
cid also assumed responsibility from ptd for activities related to the development of photodiodes for use in high speed fiber optic systems 
cid s revenues totaled  related to the sale of sample photodiodes 
further development of these photodiodes was suspended at the end of due to weak market conditions in the telecommunications industry 
cid expects to initiate the sale of commercial products based on ptd s livar and low light level technology during  but does not expect to realize significant revenues from these products in intevac s backlog of orders at december  was million  as compared to a december  backlog of million 
the million of backlog at december  consisted of million of epd backlog and million of ptd backlog 
the million of backlog at december  consisted of million of epd backlog and million of ptd backlog 
the reduction in epd backlog 
table of contents was primarily due to a reduction in the number of rapid thermal processing systems and disk manufacturing systems on order 
most of intevac s backlog at december  is scheduled for either customer acceptance or delivery during the first half of the company needs to book substantial orders in in order for sales to meet or exceed sales 
significant portions of our revenues in any particular period have been attributable to sales to a limited number of customers 
in  seagate  toppoly and the us army communications electronics command each accounted for more than of intevac s consolidated net revenues and in aggregate accounted for of consolidated net revenues 
in  equipment sales through matsubo  our japanese distributor  accounted for of consolidated net revenues 
in  mmc technology  seagate  westt and matsubo each accounted for more than of intevac s consolidated net revenues and in aggregate accounted for of consolidated net revenues 
our largest customers tend to change from period to period 
international sales totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively  accounting for  and of net revenues 
the decrease in international sales in compared to was primarily due to a decrease in net revenues from flat panel manufacturing systems  and to a lesser extent  to a decrease in net revenues from disk system upgrades and components 
the increase in international sales in over was primarily due to an increase in net revenues from flat panel manufacturing systems 
substantially all of intevac s international sales are to customers in the far east 
gross margin 
cost of net revenues consists primarily of purchased materials  fabrication  assembly  test and installation labor and overhead  customer specific engineering costs  warranty costs  royalties  provisions for inventory reserves  scrap and costs attributable to contract research and development 
gross margin was  and in  and  respectively 
gross margin in epd was  and in  and  respectively 
epd gross margin in improved slightly over due primarily to lower production costs and by a reduction in inventory provisions  partially offset by the under absorption of manufacturing overhead due to low manufacturing volume 
epd gross margin improved from to  but was tempered by high initial costs to manufacture intevac s redesigned flat panel manufacturing systems and establishment of million of inventory reserves related to a cancelled order for a custom flat panel system 
epd gross margin excluding the effect of the inventory reserve would have been 
epd gross margin in was negatively impacted by establishment of million of reserves related to slow moving equipment inventory and an million write off of goodwill related to electronically swept source technology  which was acquired in and subsequently abandoned 
equipment gross margin excluding the effect of these two items would have been 
million of epd s backlog at relates to d star products that will not generate any significant gross margin 
we are not able to accurately project the gross margin for the balance of the equipment business as it will vary depending on a number of factors  including  factory utilization and pricing achieved on future orders 
gross margin in ptd was  and in  and  respectively 
ptd gross margins improved in due to a higher portion of the revenue being derived from fully funded research and development contracts 
ptd gross margins in and were negatively impacted by a significant portion of revenue being derived from cost sharing research and development contracts versus fully funded research and development contracts 
we expect that ptd gross margins will improve based on the majority of revenues being derived from fully funded research and development contracts and from prototype products 
research and development 
research and development expense consists primarily of prototype materials  salaries and related costs of employees engaged in ongoing research  design and development activities for disk manufacturing equipment  flat panel manufacturing equipment  imaging products and company funded research performed by ptd 
research and development expense totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing  and of net revenue 
the dollar decrease from to was the result of the completion during of the design activities related to development of the d star  rtp and mdp platforms  partially offset by increased expenses related to the development of cid products and ptd technology and products 
the dollar increase from to was primarily the result of increased expenses related to the development and redesign of flat panel 
table of contents manufacturing equipment and  to a lesser extent  the development of ptd technology and products 
we expect that research and development expenses in will be slightly lower than in as a result of the sale of the rapid thermal processing product line  partially offset by projected increases in cid and in ptd 
research and development expenses do not include costs of million  million and million in  and  respectively  related to ptd contract research and development  which are included in cost of net revenues 
research and development expenses also do not include costs of million  million and million incurred by intevac in  and  respectively  and reimbursed under the terms of research and development cost sharing agreements related to development of disk and flat panel manufacturing equipment 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense consists primarily of selling  marketing  customer support  production of customer samples  financial  travel  management  liability insurance  legal and professional services and bad debt expense 
domestic sales and international sales of disk manufacturing products in singapore  malaysia and taiwan are made by the company s direct sales force  whereas other international sales of disk manufacturing and other products are made by distributors and representatives that provide services such as sales  installation  warranty and customer support 
the company also has a subsidiary in singapore to support customers in southeast asia 
through the second quarter of  intevac marketed its flat panel manufacturing equipment to the far east through its japanese joint venture  imat 
during the third quarter of the company and its joint venture partner  matsubo  transferred imat s activities and employees to matsubo  which became a distributor of the company s flat panel products  and shut down the operations of imat 
selling  general and administrative expense totaled million  million and million in   and  respectively  representing  and of net revenue 
the increase in over was primarily the result of representative commissions paid on the sale of flat panel manufacturing systems  an increase in selling  general and administrative personnel in ptd and an increase in corporate general and administrative expenses 
the increase from to was primarily due to a million credit to bad debt expense recognized in we expect that selling  general and administrative expenses will increase in over due to an increase in marketing resources  the charge for underutilized space and higher charges for directors and officers insurance 
restructuring and other 
restructuring and other was a gain of million in during the third quarter of  the company adopted an expense reduction plan that included closing one of the buildings at its santa clara facility and a reduction in force of employees 
the company incurred a charge of million in related to the expense reduction plan 
in the fourth quarter of  million of the restructuring reserve was reversed due to lower than expected costs on the closure of the facility 
during the first quarter of  the company vacated the building and negotiated a lease termination for that space with its landlord  which released the company from the obligation to pay any rent after april  as a result  the company reversed million of the restructuring reserve during the first quarter of during the third quarter of  the company completed all activities related to closing the vacated portion of the building and reversed the remaining  of the restructuring reserve 
interest expense 
interest expense consists primarily of interest on the convertible notes  amortization of debt issuance costs  and  to a lesser extent in  interest on approximately million of long term debt related to the purchase of cathode technology in interest expense totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in interest expense in over was due primarily to the write off of million of debt offering costs from the original convertible note offering in as a result of the exchange of these notes for new convertible notes in july the decline in interest expense in from was primarily the result of the repurchase by intevac of million of the convertible notes during  and  to a lesser extent  the repayment of the cathode technology debt in january interest expense on intevac s outstanding convertible notes is expected to be million in interest income and other  net 
interest income and other  net totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
interest income and other  net in consisted of 
table of contents million of interest income on investments  a million gain on the sale of the rapid thermal processing product line  a million gain on the sale of fixed assets  million of dividends from california avenue llc and million of early payment discounts and other income 
interest income and other  net in consisted of million of interest income on investments  a million gain from the repurchase of intevac s convertible notes  million of dividends from california avenue llc  a million loss on the disposition of pacific gas and electric commercial paper and million of early payment discounts and other income 
interest income and other  net in consisted of million of interest income on investments  million of dividends from in california avenue llc  million of gains on foreign currency forward contracts and million of early payment discounts and other income 
provision for benefit from income taxes 
in  intevac recorded an income tax benefit of million 
this resulted from the enactment of the job creation and worker assistance act of which increased the length of time  from years to years  over which losses incurred in and could be carried back against taxes paid in prior years 
we paid federal income taxes of approximately million for  million for and million for our federal tax returns  and any refunds resulting from them  are subject to audit for years from the date filed 
intevac s net deferred tax asset totaled zero at december   net of a million valuation allowance 
we have substantial net operating loss carry forwards which can be used to limit the taxes paid in the future and to reduce our effective tax rate to less than the statutory income tax rates in effect 
in  intevac recorded million of income tax expense to provide additional valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 
our net deferred tax assets totaled zero at december   net of a million valuation allowance established due to the uncertainty of realizing certain tax credits  loss carry forwards and other deferred tax assets 
intevac s estimated effective tax rate for was 
we did not accrue a tax benefit during due to the inability to realize additional refunds from loss carry backs 
liquidity and capital resources intevac s operating activities provided cash of million in the cash provided was primarily a result of the operating loss being more than offset by a refund of federal income taxes paid in prior years  depreciation and amortization 
operating activities in used cash of million  primarily due to the net loss incurred  which was partially offset by depreciation  amortization and an increase in the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 
operating activities in generated cash of  primarily as a result of the net loss incurred being offset by an increase in customer advances  a refund of federal income taxes paid in prior years  depreciation and amortization 
investing activities in provided cash of million as a result of the sale of the rapid thermal processing product line and the sale of equipment  which was partially offset by the purchase of fixed assets 
investing activities in provided cash of million as a result of the net sale of investments  which was partially offset by the purchase of fixed assets 
investing activities in provided cash of million as a result of the net sale of investments  which was partially offset by the purchase of fixed assets 
intevac s financing activities used cash of million in  primarily as a result of the exchange of most of our convertible notes due for new convertible notes due and cash 
on july  we completed the exchange of million in aggregate principal amount of our convertible notes due for million of our new convertible subordinated notes due and million in cash  including million for accrued interest 
sales of intevac s common stock to its employees through our employee benefit plans provided cash of million 
financing activities in used cash of million  due to the repurchase of a portion of the convertible notes and the repayment of the cathode technology debt  partially offset by the sale of intevac s stock to employees under its employee benefit plans 
financing activities in provided cash of million from the sale of intevac s stock to employees under its employee benefit plans 
at december   intevac had million of cash and cash equivalents 
intevac intends to undertake approximately million in capital expenditures during the next months and believes the 
table of contents existing cash and cash equivalent balances will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements for the next twelve months 
intevac has incurred operating losses each year since and cannot predict with certainty when it will return to operating profitability 
operating profitability and cash flow are contingent upon a number of factors  but in particular on the receipt by the equipment products division of large multi system disk manufacturing equipment orders deliverable for revenue in while the company is forecasting the receipt of these orders in  it is not able to accurately predict when  or if  its equipment products division will actually receive these orders 
without the receipt of substantial equipment orders deliverable for revenue during  the company is likely to incur an operating loss and consume a significant portion of its cash during item a
