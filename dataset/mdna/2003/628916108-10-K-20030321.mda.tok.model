general change in fiscal year end our fiscal years prior to october  ended on the last saturday of september 
thereafter  we changed our fiscal year end to a calendar year ending on december as a result of the fiscal year end change  the period from october  through december   which we refer to as the transition period  precedes the start of the calendar year 
the period for the fiscal year from september  through september  is referred to in this form k as and contains fifty three weeks 
restructuring of operations during the quarter ended march   we implemented restructuring initiatives involving certain operations of our businesses 
one initiative was to purchase hot rolled coils rather than manufacture them at our welded tubular operations 
as a result  we closed the melt shop and hot strip mill operations at our welded tubular facilities in wilder  kentucky effective march  in addition  we decided to cease the manufacturing of special bar quality products which we refer to as sbq  which were being manufactured at our koppel  pennsylvania facility 
the restructuring was initiated to give us a lower  more flexible cost structure 
we believe we are achieving the expected benefits and cost savings from the restructuring 
in the march quarter  we recorded total restructuring charges of million  including million of charges resulting primarily from the write down of fixed assets and million recorded to cost of products sold related to inventories 
the closures resulted in total workforce reductions of approximately positions at the welded tubular operations in wilder  kentucky and the sbq products operations in koppel  pennsylvania 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded million of additional restructuring charges related to the march restructuring 
the charges included a million impairment loss on the assets being held for sale and million primarily related to an increase in our estimate of post closure costs for our closed landfill 
the impairment loss was based on an independent appraisal of the assets held for sale at december  discontinued operations on october   we sold our wholly owned subsidiary  imperial adhesives  inc as a result  the sales  costs and expenses  and cash flows of the former industrial products adhesives segment have been classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  the discussion and analysis that follow focus on the continuing operations of our remaining segments 
segments through june   we conducted our business within two reportable business segments the energy products segment and the industrial products segment 
in june  we exited the sbq business that comprised our industrial products segment 
since that time  we have conducted our operations solely within the energy products segment 
our energy products segment includes tubular steel products that are used in the energy industry 
these products include welded and seamless tubular goods  primarily used in oil and natural gas drilling and production operations 
these products are referred to as oil country tubular goods  or octg 
we also produce welded and seamless line pipe products  which are used in the transmission of oil and natural gas  as well as a limited amount of other tubular products 
our industrial products segment consisted solely of special bar quality products used in a variety of industrial applications such as farm equipment  heavy machinery  construction and off road vehicles 
you should read note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information pertaining to industry segment data 
results of operations overview outlook demand for our octg products is cyclical in nature  being dependent on the number and depth of oil and natural gas wells being drilled in the united states and globally 
the level of drilling activity is  among other things  dependent on the current and anticipated supply and demand for oil and natural gas 
oil and natural gas prices are volatile and can have a substantial effect upon drilling levels and resulting demand for our energy related products 
in addition  shipments by domestic producers of octg products may be positively or negatively affected by the amount of inventory held by producers  distributors and end users  as well as by imports of octg products 
the average number of oil and natural gas drilling rigs in operation in the united states is referred to as rig count 
rig count averaged for compared to  for and for in response to strong oil and natural gas prices  rig count rose steadily throughout the first half of  reaching a high of  in july however  natural gas prices began to fall as the slowdown in the economy  milder weather and fuel switching resulted in strong injection rates into natural gas storage during the summer months of the weak economy and mild weather in the latter part of resulted in historically high levels of natural gas storage going into consequently  rig count in fell from and demand for our octg products fell for the comparable periods as well 
natural gas prices rose steadily in the second half of as a result of low drilling levels during the year and increased demand  driven primarily by the weather 
as such  we expect rig count will increase during the course of and our shipments of octg will increase accordingly 
according to published industry reports  imports of octg products in were an estimated of the total domestic market  compared to in and in in november  the united states international trade commission itc reported injury from various imported steel products under section and recommended to the president a wide scale program of quotas and duties 
however  the itc recommendation for quotas and duties did not include imports of oil country tubular goods 
in response  we  together with other domestic oil country tubular goods producers  sought relief from unfair trade by filing petitions with the itc against certain countries 
in may  the itc voted against our suit and the case was terminated 
as a result  we expect to continue to experience high levels of competition from imports 
on march   the president of the united states announced his remedy decision in response to the international trade commission s section investigation on steel imports 
under the remedy decision  effective march   tariff rates of  and will be applied to imports of hot rolled coil for the next three years  respectively 
imports from canada  mexico  and certain other countries are exempt from the tariffs 
the tariffs increased the cost of imported hot rolled coils  which we believe in turn has increased the cost of domestic hot rolled coils 
in addition to the impact from imports  our purchased coil costs are also affected by domestic supply and demand factors  freight costs and general economic conditions 
increases in our steel costs adversely affect our financial results if we are not able to successfully raise the price of our products to compensate for the increased costs 
our purchased coil costs for increased by over since  the us government has been imposing duties on imports of various octg products from argentina  italy  japan  korea and mexico in response to antidumping and countervailing duty cases filed by several us companies 
in june  the itc voted to continue these duties for five more years 
the itc s decision has been appealed by the affected countries and decisions are pending 
in response to petitions filed with the us government by us and certain other line pipe producers  import relief was granted to the line pipe industry effective march  this relief was in the form of tariffs applied to imports of welded line pipe that is inch or less in diameter  from all countries excluding canada and mexico 
the tariffs expired on march  we cannot predict the us government s future actions regarding duties and tariffs or any other future actions regarding import duties or other trade restrictions on imports of octg and line pipe products

results for included restructuring charges which increased the net loss by million  or per diluted share 
energy products energy products segment sales of million in were million  or  less than the million reported for product shipments of  tons in were  tons  or  less than the  tons in the significant decreases in sales and shipments were experienced by both our seamless and welded products 
the decrease in shipments was a direct result of the lower rig count in also  distributors lowered their inventories in  which further negatively impacted our shipments 
in addition  the level of imports negatively impacted our shipments of octg products 
the average revenue per ton for our welded tubular products was per ton  a decrease of from the average revenue per ton for our seamless tubular products was per ton  a decrease of from the decreases in average revenue per ton were due primarily to the weak market conditions in the energy product segment reported a gross loss of million and an operating loss of million in  which includes million of restructuring charges 
in the segment reported a gross profit of million and operating loss of million  which includes million of restructuring charges 
the decline in profitability from was primarily the result of the significant decline in shipments  lower pricing for our products and an increase in purchased steel costs 
in addition  due to lower operating levels in  our margins were negatively impacted due to lower fixed cost absorption 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the energy product segment in decreased million  or  from primarily as a result of reduced employee and related costs due to the restructuring  as well as general cost reduction efforts implemented in industrial products sbq as mentioned previously  the industrial products sbq segment was closed in june the segment recorded sales of million and gross losses of million and operating losses of million in the first six months of included in the operating losses for are million of restructuring charges

income taxes we exhausted our federal income tax refund capability in fiscal  and as such  tax benefits from operating losses are offset by valuation allowances resulting in no net federal tax benefit being recorded for losses 
the million tax benefit recorded in the fourth quarter of resulted primarily from refund claims filed in connection with recently enacted federal income tax law changes 
the tax benefit of million recorded in resulted primarily from state income tax benefits associated with the restructuring charges and the investment impairment losses 
calendar year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended september  total net sales in were million compared to million in  a decrease of million  or 
the entire decrease can be attributed to our decision to exit our sbq business by june as a result  industrial products segment sales were million lower in the operating loss for was million  including restructuring charges of million  compared to an operating loss of million for losses from continuing operations in were million  or a loss per diluted share compared to a million  or a loss per diluted share in included in the results are restructuring charges totaling million after tax  or per diluted share 
net loss for was million  or per diluted share  compared to a net loss of million or a loss of per diluted share in energy products energy products segment sales in were million compared to million for total segment shipments were  tons compared to  tons in the slight increase in sales and the decrease of  tons in shipments were attributable to a decrease of  tons in shipments of our welded tubular products  partially offset by an increase in seamless tubular shipments and higher revenue per ton for both welded and seamless products 
the decrease in welded product shipments resulted from a focus by distributors to lower inventories as a result of the decreasing rig count in the second half of in addition  the level of imports negatively impacted our shipments of welded octg products 
shipments of our seamless products increased by  tons primarily as a result of an increase in new product offerings 
the average revenue per ton for our welded tubular products was per ton  an increase of from the average revenue per ton for our seamless tubular products was per ton  an increase of from the increases in average revenue per ton were due primarily to the improved market conditions in the first half of and a change in mix to higher priced products 
the energy product segment reported a gross profit of million and an operating loss of million in compared to a gross profit of million and an operating loss of million in the operating loss in included million of restructuring charges 
the improvements in gross profit and operating income before restructuring charges from were primarily the result of our decision to buy hot rolled coils rather than manufacture them  as well as improved revenue per ton discussed above 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the energy product segment in decreased million  or  from primarily as a result of reduced employee and related costs due to the march restructuring 
industrial products sbq industrial products segment sales in were million  down from million in the decrease in the sbq business is the result of our decision in march to close the operations by the end of june sbq product shipments were  tons compared to  tons in the average revenue per ton for sbq products was per ton compared to per ton in the industrial products segment incurred a gross loss of million and an operating loss of million compared to a million gross loss and an operating loss of million in the operating loss in included million of restructuring charges 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the segment decreased million  or  from because of cost reductions resulting from the decision to exit the business 
investment income  interest expense  other income investment losses in were million  compared to income of million in the primary reason for the decrease was the recognition of million of impairment losses on certain long term investments in the fourth quarter of in addition  the interest rates earned on our invested cash and investment balances declined throughout from those earned in interest expense was slightly lower in as a result of our purchasing million of our senior notes in the open market in the fourth quarter of calendar and an additional million in the first quarter of other income  net was million in compared to million in the amounts reported for and include million and million  respectively  of cash receipts from favorable claim settlements with electrode suppliers relating to purchases in prior years 
transition period ended december  compared to quarter ended january  net sales in the transition period were million  a decrease of from the fourth quarter of we reported a loss from continuing operations before extraordinary items of million  or a loss per diluted share  in the transition period 
in the quarter ended january   we reported a loss from continuing operations before extraordinary items of million  or a loss per diluted share 
income from discontinued operations  net of income taxes  for the transition period was million  or per diluted share  and primarily consisted of the gain on the sale of our adhesives business in october extraordinary items recognized in the transition period increased net income by million  net of income taxes  or per diluted share 
the extraordinary items consisted of an extraordinary credit of million related to a reversal of environmental liability accruals which was partially offset by a million extraordinary charge resulting from the early retirement of debt 
energy products energy products segment sales were million in the transition period  an increase of from the comparable period ended january  the increase in energy product segment sales was attributable to an increase in selling prices and an increase in shipments of seamless tubular products  offset by a decline in welded tubular product shipments 
total shipments of energy products for the transition period were  tons  a decrease of from the comparable prior year period 
the decrease was the result of a decrease in shipments of our welded energy products  which declined from the comparable prior year period 
the decline in welded energy product shipments resulted primarily from a focus by distributors on slowing the growth in inventories of welded carbon grade octg products 
in addition  the level of imports negatively impacted our shipments of welded octg products 
shipments of our seamless products  which are substantially alloy grade products  increased from the prior year comparable quarter 
the average revenue per ton during the transition period for our welded and seamless tubular products was and per ton  respectively 
this was an increase of for welded products and a increase for seamless products from the comparable prior year period 
the improved pricing was directly related to the improvement in the rig count 
the energy products segment recorded a gross profit of million and an operating loss of million in the transition period compared to a gross loss and operating loss of million and million  respectively  in the quarter ended january  the reduction in losses from the prior year period was primarily the result of improved pricing for welded and seamless tubular products and an increase in seamless energy product shipments 
selling  general and administrative expense for the energy products segment in the transition period increased million from the quarter ended january  industrial products sbq the industrial products segment sales were million for the transition period  a decrease of from the quarter ended january  sbq product shipments for the transition period decreased from the comparable prior year period 
the average selling price for sbq products for the quarter was per ton  a increase over the comparable prior year period 
the industrial products segment recorded a gross loss of million and an operating loss of million in the transition period compared to a gross loss of million and an operating loss of million  in the quarter ended january  the increase in the gross loss and the operating loss was the result of the significant decline in shipments resulting from a decrease in end user demand and high service center inventory levels 
investment income  interest expense  other investment income for the transition period was million  a million decrease from the comparable prior year period  which resulted from lower average invested cash and investment balances and realized losses on available for sale securities 
income taxes accounting pronouncements require that income tax expense or benefit be allocated among continuing operations  discontinued operations  and extraordinary items 
the net effect of the allocation of the gain on the sale of imperial in the transition period was to provide a provision for taxes on the income from discontinued operations  which was offset by an income tax benefit being recorded for the losses from continuing operations 
the net recorded amounts for income taxes in the quarter ended january  represented state and local income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources working capital at december  was million compared to million at december   and the ratio of current assets to current liabilities at december  was to  compared to a ratio of to at december  the working capital decrease was primarily due to our use of cash to repay million of our long term debt and to fund operating losses for our working capital was also reduced by the million current maturities of our senior notes due in july at december   we had cash and investments totaling million compared to million at december  net cash flows used by operating activities were million in we recorded a net loss of million in major components of cash from operating activities in included million in depreciation and amortization charges  million in restructuring charges  and a decrease in accounts receivable and accounts payable of million and million  respectively  resulting primarily from a decline in business activity in net cash flows provided by operating activities totaled million in we recorded a net loss of million in major components of cash from operating activities in included million in depreciation and amortization charges  restructuring charges of million represented charges primarily for the write down of fixed assets  a million impairment loss on investments  and a decrease in accounts receivable and inventories of million and million  respectively  resulting primarily from a decline in business activity in the second half of and the effect of exiting the sbq business 
the decrease in accrued liabilities of million resulted primarily from a lower balance of deferred revenue at december  we recorded a net loss from continuing operations of million in the transition period 
in addition  income from discontinued operations  net of income taxes  was million and was mainly the result of recognizing the gain on the sale of imperial in the quarter 
cash flows from operating activities totaled million in the period 
major components of cash from operating activities from continuing operations included million in depreciation and amortization charges and a million and million decrease in accounts receivable and inventory  respectively  resulting from the decline in business activity 
accounts payable decreased million primarily as a result of the decline in business activity 
net cash flows used by operating activities was million in we recorded a net loss from continuing operations of million in major components of cash from operating activities in included million in depreciation and amortization charges  a million decrease in operating supplies and other current assets which resulted primarily from the receipt of refundable federal income taxes  and a million increase in accrued liabilities and other as a result of a higher balance of deferred revenue  partially offset by a decrease in accrued environmental liabilities 
major uses of cash included a million increase in accounts receivable and a million increase in inventories resulting from an increase in business activity in our energy products segment in the last half of we made capital investments totaling million in  million in  million in the transition period and million in these capital expenditures were primarily related to improvements to our energy products segment facilities 
we currently estimate that capital spending will be in the range of million to million 
our sources of funding capital expenditures include available cash and investments  available cash flows from operations  and our available borrowing sources and the amount ultimately spent will depend upon the availability of these resources 
on june   we made an early redemption call for million in principal amount of our senior secured notes 
the redemption was at par plus accrued interest and was completed on july  using existing cash balances 
in addition  repayments of long term debt in and the transition period included the early retirement of million and million  respectively  of principal amount of our senior secured notes 
long term debt maturities for each of the next five years are less than million except for the remaining million of our senior notes that come due in july we are currently evaluating new financing proposals with potential lenders to refinance the notes  however  we believe we will have sufficient resources to meet the senior notes obligation from current sources of liquidity 
we entered into a new five year revolving credit facility in march that provides up to million under a borrowing formula that is based upon eligible inventory and accounts receivable  subject to certain reserves and satisfaction of certain conditions to each draw under the facility 
interest rates on the facility vary according to the amount of loans outstanding and range from the prime rate plus to prime plus with respect to domestic rate loans  and from the libor rate plus to libor plus with respect to libor rate loans 
the facility contains various representations and warranties and operating and other covenants 
there are no financial covenants under the facility 
there have been no borrowings under the facility  however  at december   million of letters of credit were issued against the credit line for workers compensation purposes 
the facility is secured by a first priority lien on all inventories  accounts receivable and related intangibles of the company 
as of december   the company had approximately million in borrowing availability under the agreement  based on eligible receivable and inventory balances and net of outstanding letters of credit on such date 
additionally  in july we filed a universal shelf registration statement for the issuance and sale from time to time to the public of up to million in securities  including debt  preferred stock  common stock and warrants 
the shelf registration was declared effective by the secin september we have not sold any securities pursuant to the shelf registration 
see note in the accompanying financial statements for more information on the credit facility and shelf registration 
we believe that these new facilities afford us the financial flexibility to react to future opportunities in the market 
we believe that our existing cash and equivalents  long term investments  borrowing capacity and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy anticipated cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
in february  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to two million shares of our common stock through the period ending march  repurchases were authorized to be made from time to time in open market purchases or through privately negotiated transactions  when  in the opinion of management  market conditions warrant 
no shares were repurchased in under this authorization 
during  we repurchased  of our outstanding shares in open market transactions for million and million shares for approximately million in the transition period 
we did not purchase any of our common shares during in october  we received million cash for the sale of imperial 
you should read note to the consolidated financial statements for further information concerning the sale of imperial 
we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements other than immaterial operating leases 
at december   we had regular tax net operating loss carryforwards which will fully eliminate the regular tax liability on approximately million of future regular taxable income 
while we may have alternative minimum tax amt liability  we also have amt net operating loss carryforwards which will eliminate of the amt liability on approximately million of future amt income 
while future tax provisions will depend in part on our ongoing assessment of our future ability to utilize our tax benefits  we expect that the tax provisions that we record on approximately the next million in pre tax income will be substantially less than the amounts at full statutory rates 
you should read note to the consolidated financial statements for further information concerning our federal tax status 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to allowance for doubtful accounts  inventories  investments  long lived assets  income taxes  customer claims  product liability  workers compensation claims  restructuring liabilities  environmental contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales when the product is shipped from our facilities and risk of loss and title has passed to the customer or  at the customer s request  the goods are set aside in storage and are paid for in full 
for transactions where we have not obtained customer acceptance  revenue is deferred until the terms of acceptance are satisfied 
accounts receivable allowances we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory valuation we value our inventories principally at the lower of cost or market and regularly review the book value to determine if items are properly valued 
we record adjustments to the value of our inventory based on sales and production forecasts 
these adjustments are estimates  which can vary significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from actual amounts if future costs or levels of business activity differ from our expectations 
generally  we do not experience issues with slow moving or obsolete inventory due to the nature of our products 
if we are not able to achieve our expectations of the net realizable value of the inventory at its current value  we would have to adjust our reserves accordingly 
long term investments we have investments in debt securities that are classified as available for sale  some of which are publicly traded and have a volatile share price or quoted market price 
we record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
long lived asset impairment we perform impairment analysis of our long lived assets whenever events and circumstances indicate that they may be impaired 
when the undiscounted cash flows  without interest or tax charges  are less than the carrying value of the assets being reviewed for impairment  the assets are written down to fair market value 
during and  we recorded long lived asset impairment provisions that resulted from the restructuring of our operations 
reserves for contingencies we have numerous other potential exposures  such as restructuring liabilities  workers compensation claims  environmental claims  product liability  litigation and recoverability of deferred income taxes 
establishing loss reserves or valuation allowances for these matters requires us to estimate and make judgments in regards to risk exposure and ultimate liability 
we establish accruals for these exposures  however  if our exposure exceeds our estimates  we could be required to record additional charges

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk purchased steel in the form of hot rolled coils and steel scrap represents the largest portion of our cost of goods sold 
the price and availability of steel coils and scrap that we use in our manufacturing processes are highly competitive and volatile 
various factors  most of which are beyond our control  affect the supply and price of steel coils and scrap 
changes in steel coil and scrap costs have had and will continue to have a significant impact on our earnings 
our long term investments and long term debt  all of which are for other than trading purposes  are subject to interest rate risk 
information concerning the maturities and fair value of our interest rate sensitive investments and debt is included in notes  and to the consolidated financial statements 
we utilize professional investment advisors and consider our net interest rate risk when selecting the type and maturity of securities to purchase for our portfolio 
other factors considered include  but are not limited to  the timing of the expected need for the funds invested and the repricing and credit risks of the securities 
as of december   we were not engaged in any activities which would cause exposure to the risk of material earnings or cash flow loss due to changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates or market commodity prices 
we purchase natural gas for our operations and  therefore  have a limited market risk in gas prices related to gas purchases in the open market at spot prices 
the prices of such gas purchases and futures positions are subject to wide fluctuations at times due to unpredictable factors such as weather  government policies and demand for natural gas and competitive fuels 
as a result  our earnings could be affected by changes in the price and availability of such gas 
as market conditions dictate  we from time to time will lock in future gas prices using fixed price contracts 
we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged derivatives
