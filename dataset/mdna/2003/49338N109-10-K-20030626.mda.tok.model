critical accounting policies general 
the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to product returns  bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  insurance  pensions and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
bad debt 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory 
the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
deferred taxes 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
insurance 
the company s main insurance programs medical  dental  workers compensation and vehicle are designed as large deductible programs 
through these programs the company self insures losses up to a deductible limit and purchases stop loss insurance to protect against losses that are over the deductible 
the stop loss insurance is purchased on an individual and aggregate basis 
the amount of the deductible has risen significantly in the last two years resulting in a shift of risk from the insurance carrier to the company 
the company estimates its cost for these programs and maintains reserves for incurred  but not reported  losses 
if the company were to experience an increase in claims activity over anticipated amounts  and its reserves are not sufficient  additional reserves may be required  which would have an unanticipated impact on future earnings

the number of collision repairs is directly impacted by the weather 
accordingly  the company s sales generally are highest during the five month period from december to april 
the impact of seasonality has reduced somewhat as keystone has become more geographically diversified 
other factors which influence quarterly variations include the number of business days during the holiday seasons  the timing of the introduction of new products  the level of consumer acceptance of new products  general economic conditions that affect consumer spending  the timing of supplier price changes and the timing of expenditures in anticipation of increased sales and customer delivery requirements 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary use of funds over the past two years has been for acquisitions  the development and implementation of an enterprise wide management information system and the paydown of bank borrowings 
at march   working capital was million compared to million at march  the increase in working capital is primarily the result of cash generated from operations 
the company financed its working capital requirements and the acquisitions completed during fiscal from cash flow from operations and borrowings under the company s line of credit 
during the year ended march   the company s cash and cash equivalents were essentially unchanged  having increased by  this small increase is the result of i cash provided by operating activities of million and cash provided by financing activities of million  offset by ii cash used in investing activities of million  primarily as a result of cash used to purchase property and equipment primarily related to the implementation of the company s enterprise software package and cash paid for acquisitions 
the cash provided by operating activities resulted from net income of million increased by million of non cash expenses and partially offset by a million decrease in cash from changes in working capital components 
the working capital component change primarily reflects an increase in inventories and accounts receivable of million and million  respectively  offset by an increase in accounts payable of million 
the most significant non cash expenses were depreciation and amortization of million and a million provision for a write down of inventories and accounts receivable 
the cash provided by financing activities was as a result of increased borrowings under the company s bank credit facility of million and cash provided from the exercise of stock options of million 
the company has in place a revolving line of credit with a commercial lender that provides for a million secured credit facility which balance is due on june  advances under the revolving line of credit bear interest either at libor plus or at the lender s prime rate 
at march   million had been drawn down under the line of credit and  of this amount  million was at interest  million was at interest and the balance was at interest 
the line of credit is subject to certain restrictive covenants set forth in the loan agreement  which requires that the company maintain certain financial ratios 
the company was in compliance with all such covenants at march   and at the date of the filing of this annual report 
at june   the company had drawn down million under the line of credit 
the increase in borrowings from march  is primarily the result of million used to complete two acquisitions and the funding of short term working capital requirements 
in march  the company caused its commercial lender to issue a million letter of credit to the company s primary insurer to secure the company s deductible reimbursement obligations 
in december  this letter of credit was renewed and an additional letter of credit was established for million in april the amount of these letters of credit reduces the funds available under the company s credit facility 
at june   million was available to the company under the line of credit 
in september  the company initiated a stock repurchase program 
repurchased shares are retired and treated as authorized but unissued shares 
through march   the company had repurchased approximately million shares of its common stock at an average cost of per share 
no shares were repurchased during the years ended march  and march  during the year ended march   the company repurchased  shares at a cost of approximately million 
the company believes that its existing working capital  anticipated cash flow from operations and funds anticipated to be available under its line of credit will enable it to finance its operations  including the costs related to the installation of the new enterprise wide management information system see business management information systems and possible acquisitions for at least the next months 
however  the company s liquidity expectations are subject to numerous factors  many of which are beyond the company s control 
anticipated cash flow from operations are subject to the risks of the business  the most significant of which are discussed under business cautionary statements above 
especially important are the risks discussed under litigation impacting aftermarket collision replacement parts and federal and state action  above 
since the company s product sales are so dependent upon the acceptance of aftermarket parts by insurance companies  adverse verdicts or restrictive legislation could reduce sales and negatively impact cash flow from operations 
the availability of funds under the company s line of credit could also be restricted or eliminated in the event that the company does not maintain the financial ratios required under the credit agreement 
these ratios include such items as amount of indebtedness  earnings before interest  taxes and depreciation and amortization  net worth and the current ratio 
in the event that the company s operations do not meet expectations it is possible that needed liquidity will not be available under the credit facility 
the company has no long term debt or long term capital commitments 
the balance outstanding under the company s revolving secured credit facility is due june  the following table summarizes future minimum operating lease commitments as of march  year ending march amount in thousands thereafter total minimum rental payments inflation the company does not believe that the relatively moderate rates of inflation over the past three years have had a significant effect on its net sales or its profitability

the company continues to review the impairment of goodwill under sfas no 
goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are no longer amortized but are tested at least annually for impairment 
intangible assets with finite useful lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as a result of the early adoption of sfas nos 
and effective march   the company tested its goodwill for impairment and recorded a charge of million  net of tax  retroactive to the first quarter of fiscal  accounted for as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
the decrease in goodwill at the end of fiscal  compared to fiscal  reflects this charge 
with sfas no 
 effective march   the company ceased amortizing goodwill 
goodwill amortization was million for fiscal the company reviews the recoverability of its long lived assets as required by sfas no 
and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges for these assets
