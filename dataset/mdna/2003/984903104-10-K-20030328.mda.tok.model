item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the statements in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations that are forward looking are based on current expectations and beliefs and involve numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations 
see safe harbor statement and factors affecting future results sections following 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing on pages to results of operations sales our sales are derived from two product groups  mixed signal products and memory products 
mixed signal product sales represent our core market 
memory product sales comprise our legacy businesses of serial eeproms  which we have substantially exited  and parallel eeproms  which business we are retaining 
annual sales by product group were year ended december  in thousands mixed signal product sales mixed signal royalty revenue memory product sales total sales overall economic and industry wide conditions were weak throughout and which negatively impacted our revenues in all product groups 
in particular  the communications market segments that we sell our products into were adversely impacted by the severe economic downturn that was characterized by a significant drop in end user demand and exacerbated by excess inventory in global sales channels 
sales of mixed signal products represented of total net sales in  compared to of total net sales in and of total net sales in mixed signal product sales decreased from to and decreased from to the decreases were primarily due to lower demand in the communications market as well as an overall decrease in the general economy 
mixed signal sales were level sequentially in the first two quarters of and then declined in the second half of the year on lower unit sales 
in the first quarter of  mixed signal sales remained relatively stable compared to the fourth quarter of mixed signal sales increased sequentially in the second quarter of on higher unit sales  increased sequentially in the third quarter of on higher unit sales and then remained relatively stable sequentially in the fourth quarter of as shown in the table below  memory product sales declined in and in compared to the immediately preceding year year ended december  in thousands parallel eeprom product sales serial eeprom product sales total memory product sales parallel eeprom product sales decreased from to and decreased from to principally due to lower unit shipments as the overall market for these products contracted and weak economic conditions persisted 
serial eeprom product sales declined in as we continued to exit this business 
serial sales decreased from to and decreased from to the serial eeprom 
table of contents sales decreases were primarily due to lower unit shipments and  to a lesser extent  lower average selling prices 
we believe that will be a challenging year as the overall weak economic and industry conditions experienced in extend into we expect little contribution to revenue from sales of serial eeprom products in as we have substantially completed our exit from that business 
we are focused on our plans to grow our revenue in high performance mixed signal products in compared to cost of sales and gross profit gross profit as a percentage of sales was in  in  and in as discussed below  cost of sales for the first quarter of included an million charge to write down inventories 
excluding the inventory write down  gross profit as a percentage of sales was 
the gross profit percentage in benefited from a shift in the product mix to a larger percentage of higher margin mixed signal and parallel eeprom sales and a smaller percentage of lower margin serial eeprom sales  the amortization of million of the deferred gain on the sale of the fab assets over a lower sales level and lower manufacturing costs due to spending controls 
these benefits were partially offset by lower absorption of fixed costs as manufacturing volumes were reduced in due to the weak industry wide economic conditions 
compared to  the gross profit percentage excluding the inventory write down benefited from a shift in the product mix to a larger percentage of higher margin mixed signal and parallel eeprom sales and a smaller percentage of lower margin serial eeprom sales  the amortization of million of the deferred gain on the sale of the fab assets and lower costs associated with our shift to fully outsourced manufacturing completed in the second quarter of cost of sales in included a million credit related to the amortization of the deferred gain on the fab sale 
the net benefit to gross margin resulting from the sale of products that had been previously written down was less than million in each of the years ended december  and the gross profit percentage is expected to fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result in changes in product mix  product costs and average selling prices 
research and development research and development expenses amounted to million or of sales in  million or of sales in  and million or of sales in the absolute dollar amount of research and development expenses in was relatively consistent with the expense level as the benefits from spending controls were largely offset by the increased personnel costs resulting from the second quarter acquisition of our signal processing group  formerly analog integration partners llc aip 
while research and development expenses increased as a percentage of sales in compared to due to the lower sales level  the dollar amount of research and development expenses decreased in compared to primarily due to lower personnel costs and spending controls 
we intend to continue to invest in research and development in  although at a lower absolute dollar level than in as we continue to monitor product development expenses and pare back ancillary engineering projects 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses amounted to million or of sales in  million or of sales in  and million or of sales in the decrease in the dollar amount of selling  general and administrative expenses in compared to is primarily due to reduced personnel expenses of million related to headcount reductions and million lower commission expenses related primarily to the decreased sales in and to a lesser extent overall spending controls 
the decrease in the dollar amount of selling  general and administrative expenses in compared to is due primarily to headcount reductions and lower commission expenses related to the decreased sales in  partially offset by increased legal costs associated with protecting our intellectual property rights 

table of contents restructuring and other charges year ended december  in thousands restructuring and facilities inventory write down total at the beginning of  we had restructuring accruals of million primarily related to the expected costs to close our milpitas in house wafer fabrication facility 
in november  we completed the sale of the wafer fabrication assets and inventory to standard mems  inc standard mems for a gross purchase price of million 
during we utilized million of restructuring reserves 
related reductions in workforce of approximately employees  primarily in manufacturing and related support groups  occurred primarily in the fourth quarter of as a result of the sale of the fab  we incurred restructuring charges at levels significantly below amounts previously estimated and accrued 
the net restructuring credit of million recorded in consists of a reversal of million of costs originally included in the restructuring accrual not utilized due primarily to the sale of the fab to standard mems  partially offset by million principally related to additional workforce reductions that we identified and committed to in the fourth quarter of to streamline operations and further implement our outsourced manufacturing strategy 
at the time of the sale of the wafer fabrication assets and inventory  xicor and standard mems also entered into a related foundry agreement for standard mems to become a xicor foundry 
the sale of the wafer fabrication assets and inventory resulted in a net gain of million  which was recorded as a deferred gain on sale of fab assets 
we established the amortization period of the gain at two years  which was the minimum term of the foundry agreement 
cost of sales for  and included a million  million and million credit  respectively  related to the amortization of the deferred gain on the sale of the fab assets 
the benefit from the amortization of the deferred gain ended in the third quarter of due to the early termination of the foundry agreement  and the remaining unamortized balance of million was included in other income in the third quarter of in the first quarter of  we announced our plan to exit from offering stand alone low density serial eeprom memory products and complete the move to fully outsourced test and assembly operations 
accordingly  our first quarter results included an million charge to cost of sales to write down inventories to their net realizable value and a million restructuring charge 
the million restructuring charge consisted of million of severance related costs for an additional reduction in our workforce of approximately employees  million of fixed asset write offs principally related to leasehold improvements in the facility that housed our test operation and million of other restructuring related costs 
during  we reduced our workforce by approximately employees and utilized million of the restructuring reserve for related severance costs and million for other restructuring related costs 
at december   the restructuring accrual of million consisted of million of severance costs including costs to reduce the workforce by approximately employees primarily in sales and administrative groups and million of other costs associated with vacated sales offices 
in  due to the ongoing weak industry conditions  we implemented two additional reductions in force that affected employees in all areas of the company 
in the second quarter of we reduced our workforce by employees  which resulted in a million restructuring charge for severance related costs 
quarterly cost reductions of approximately million associated with the second quarter reduction in workforce were partially offset by increased research and development expenses 
in the fourth quarter of  we notified employees that their employment would cease on various dates in the fourth quarter of and first quarter of  which resulted in a million restructuring charge for severance related costs 
a significant portion of the million of quarterly cost reductions resulting from the fourth quarter reduction in workforce are expected to be realized in the first quarter of 
table of contents in the fourth quarter of we entered into a lease agreement for a facility to be used as our corporate headquarters 
we vacated our prior headquarters facility in the fourth quarter of  and a third party assumed the related lease in the first quarter of in the fourth quarter of we also vacated our leased bay area sales office facility and the leased facility that we assumed as part of the aip acquisition and relocated the employees from both facilities to our corporate headquarters 
terminating our prior facility lease and entering into the new facility lease allowed us to consolidate our operations in a more efficient facility and reduce our future minimum lease commitments  exclusive of restructuring related lease payments  by approximately million per year in through our minimum lease commitment increased by million in as the new facility lease term is one year longer than the prior facility lease term 
the facilities abandonments resulted in a fourth quarter facilities related restructuring charge of million consisting of million for the non cash abandonment of leasehold improvements  equipment and furniture and million of exit costs consisting primarily of rent after abandonment of the facilities 
rent expense in is expected to approximate our net rent expense as the gross rent for the prior facility was reduced by an month sublease that was due to expire in during  we reduced our workforce by approximately employees and utilized million of the restructuring reserve for related severance costs and million for other restructuring related costs 
at december   the restructuring accrual of million consisted of million of severance costs payable to terminated employees and million of costs associated with vacated facilities 
acquisition of analog integration partners llc on april   we acquired analog integration partners llc aip  a privately held company that designs and develops high performance analog signal processing and data conversion circuits  for total consideration of million  consisting of million of stock  shares of xicor common stock valued at per share  the average closing price for the three consecutive days ended april   million in cash  and direct acquisition costs of million for legal  appraisal and accounting fees 
the million of the purchase price allocated to current technology and million allocated to customer contracts for professional services are being amortized using the straight line method over their useful lives of years and months  respectively 
the million of the purchase price allocated to goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes  and in accordance with sfas no 
will not be amortized but instead evaluated periodically to determine whether events or circumstances have occurred indicating that goodwill might be impaired 
the million of the purchase price allocated to in process research and development expense in the second quarter of relates to aip s current engineering effort that is focused on developing the analog front end for the high end flat panel display market using a standard digital micron cmos process 
management determined the value of the in process research and development based upon various factors  including an independent appraisal 
the appraisal used a discounted cash flow method and several factors including projected financial results  relative risk of successful development  time value of money and level of completion 
projected financial results were based on a number of estimates including market growth rates  the company s competitive position  the product roadmap  the company s cost structure  development timelines  resource requirements and the long term effective tax rate 
the risk adjusted discount rate used for projected cash flows was 
as of the acquisition date  the project was estimated to be approximately complete and the estimated cost to complete the project was approximately million 
revenues related to products developed under this project are planned to begin toward the end of uncertainties and risks associated with completing development in a reasonable period of time include the remaining effort to achieve technological feasibility  rapidly changing customer markets and competition 
failure to bring these products to market in a timely manner could adversely impact our sales and profitability in the future and potentially impair the million assigned to goodwill 

table of contents other income and expense interest expense increased in compared to due to interest expense and amortization resulting from our november issuance of million of convertible subordinated notes and warrants 
interest expense decreased in compared to due to the sale of the milpitas wafer fabrication assets and payoff of related equipment lease debt in november  partially offset by increased interest expense and amortization due to our november issuance of million of convertible subordinated notes and warrants 
interest income decreased in compared to primarily as a result of lower interest rates  partially offset by an increase in the average balance invested 
the average cash and investments balance was higher in than in primarily due to funds generated from the november issuance of convertible subordinated notes and warrants  partially offset by funds used in operating activities and for the second quarter acquisition of aip 
interest income decreased in compared to primarily as a result of lower interest rates 
interest income is expected to decrease in compared to due to the lower average cash and investments balance and  to a lesser extent  lower interest rates 
other expense for the year ended december  includes a non cash impairment charge of million to write off an investment held in a private company 
other income for the year ended december  includes  from a favorable sales tax audit  a  benefit associated with the sale of our wafer fabrication facility in and  from the early termination of a wafer foundry agreement with standard mems 
taxes no taxes were provided in due to the net loss 
the provision for income taxes for and consisted primarily of federal and state minimum taxes  which resulted from limitations on the use of net operating loss carryforwards  and foreign taxes 
net deferred tax assets of million at the end of remain fully reserved because of the uncertainty regarding the ultimate realization of these assets 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
corresponding balances at the end of and were million and million  respectively 
in we used million of cash in operating activities including million associated with restructuring activities 
cash used in investing activities was million in  consisting of net investments in cash based  available for sale securities of million  the cash portion of the consideration paid to acquire aip and million of equipment purchases 
we generated million of net cash from financing activities in  consisting of million of cash generated from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans  partially offset by million of cash used to repay long term capital lease obligations 
in we used million of cash in operating activities including million associated with restructuring activities 
cash used in investing activities was million in  consisting of million invested in standard mems  and million for equipment purchases million of equipment purchases  net of million of equipment financing 
we generated million of net cash from financing activities in  principally due to our november issuance of million of convertible notes and warrants due november  with semiannual interest payments on may and november of each year 
the notes are convertible  at the option of the holder  into our common stock at any time unless previously redeemed or repurchased  at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment in certain events 
the net proceeds of the offering after payment of the underwriting discount and expenses of the offering of million were million 
we also generated million of cash from the issuance of stock under employee stock plans and used million to repay long term capital lease obligations in in we generated million of cash from operating activities  million of proceeds from the sale of the wafer fabrication assets and inventory to standard mems and million from the issuance of 
table of contents stock under employee stock plans 
we used million of cash to repay long term obligations and million for equipment purchases in during  we expect to use cash in operating activities including interest payments on the convertible note and costs associated with restructuring activities  to repay long term obligations and purchase equipment 
capital expenditures for are currently planned at approximately million and are primarily related to test and product design equipment 
at december   we had entered into commitments for equipment purchases aggregating less than million 
at december   our principal source of liquidity was million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
management believes that our existing sources of liquidity will be adequate to support our activities for the next twelve months 
below is a summary of fixed payments related to certain contractual obligations 
payment timing may be subject to change 
payments due by period total after in millions convertible subordinated notes including interest operating leases capital leases purchase commitments total represents open purchase orders at december  for which goods and services have not been received  of which less than million relates to capital commitments 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein 
we use a combination of historical results and anticipated future events to estimate and make assumptions relating to our financial statements 
actual results could differ from our estimates 
the securities and exchange commission defines critical accounting policies as those that are  in management s view  most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and most demanding in their calls on judgment 
we believe our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition our customers include original equipment manufacturers  distributors and contract manufacturers 
we recognize revenue from sales when the rights and risks of ownership have passed to the customer  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been shipped  the price is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
sales are reduced for estimated returns and adjustments 
we base these estimates on historical data and other known factors 
actual results could be different from our estimates resulting in future charges or credits to earnings 
certain of our sales to distributors are contractually subject to rights of return and price concessions on unsold merchandise 
because of frequent sales price reductions on standard products  the distributors return rights and rapid technological obsolescence in the industry  we defer recognition of such sales until the distributors sell the merchandise 
from time to time we terminate distributors  contractually eliminate their rights of return and price concessions or obsolete parts in the distribution channel 
in such cases  we recognize revenue after the distributors return rights lapse and the price is fixed 
amounts billed to the distributors  net of estimated price concessions  are included as accounts receivable and the related gross profit is deferred and reflected as a current liability until the revenue is 
table of contents recognized 
the amount of gross profit recognized by us in future periods could differ from the deferred income on shipments to distributors due to the distributors contractual rights of return and price concessions on unsold merchandise 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
accounts receivable at december  and are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of million 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
each quarter we evaluate our inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence 
inventories on hand in excess of forecasted demand are not valued and we write off inventories that are considered obsolete 
remaining inventory balances are adjusted to approximate the lower of cost or market value 
product and technology transitions announced by us or our competitors  changes in the purchasing patterns of our customers and distribution partners  or adverse global economic conditions may materially affect estimates of our inventory reserve requirements resulting in additional inventory write downs 
during  we recorded an million charge to cost of sales to write down inventories to their net realizable value in connection with our plan to exit from offering stand alone low density serial eeprom memory products 
long lived assets long lived assets are principally comprised of investments  fixed assets and goodwill and purchased intangible assets from acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method 
the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price paid to the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired  including in process research and development 
the amounts and useful lives assigned to intangible assets impact future amortization 
the amount assigned to in process research and development is expensed immediately 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
factors impacting the impairment review include significant negative industry trends  significant underutilization of the assets  significant changes in how we use the assets or our plans for their use  underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  changes in market demand and competition and significant changes in company strategy 
if our review determines the future undiscounted cash flows related to these assets will not be sufficient to recover their carrying value  we will reduce the carrying values of these assets down to our estimate of fair market value and continue depreciating them over their remaining useful lives 
our estimates of fair market value are generally based on discounted cash flow analyses or outside appraisals 
restructuring in connection with restructuring plans  we are required to make estimates about the effects of matters  or future events  that are inherently uncertain 
among other items  we estimate the salvage value of assets impaired  which requires judgments concerning such factors as fluctuating equipment markets and timing and method of disposal and the cost and timing of closing leased facilities  which requires judgments concerning such factors as fluctuating real estate markets and timing of disposal 
in  we recorded a net restructuring credit of million consisting of million of costs originally included in the restructuring accrual not utilized primarily due to the unanticipated sale of the fabrication facility  partially offset by million related principally to additional workforce reductions to streamline operations and further implement our outsourced manufacturing strategy 
in  we recorded a million restructuring charge associated with the move to fully outsourced test and assembly operations and the exit from offering stand alone low density serial eeprom memory products 
in  
table of contents we recorded million of restructuring and facilities charges associated with workforce reductions and the relocation of our corporate headquarters 
income taxes management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
our net deferred tax assets of million at december  remain fully reserved because of the uncertainty regarding the ultimate realization of these assets 
in the event we determine that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets will be recorded as a credit to income in the period the determination is made 
contingencies and litigation from time to time  we are a defendant or plaintiff in various legal actions  which arise in the normal course of business 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required for these contingencies  if any  which would be charged to earnings  is made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in circumstances 
changes in required reserves could increase or decrease our earnings in the period the changes are made

safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of this annual report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of  including statements regarding the belief that will be a challenging year as the overall weak economic and industry conditions experienced in continue in  the expectation that there will be little contribution to revenue from the sales of serial eeprom products in  our plan to grow our revenue in high performance mixed signal products in compared to  the expectation that the gross profit percentage will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of changes in product mix  product costs and average selling prices  the plan to continue to invest in research and development in  although at a lower absolute dollar level than in as we continue to monitor product development expenses and pare back ancillary engineering projects  the plan to begin generating revenues from products developed using the in process research and development acquired from aip toward the end of  the expectation that interest income will decrease in compared to due to lower average cash and investment balances and  to a lesser extent  lower interest rates  the 
table of contents expectation to use cash in  the projection that capital expenditures will approximate million  and the expectation that our existing sources of liquidity will be adequate to support operations for the next twelve months 
except for historical information  the matters discussed in this annual report on form k are forward looking statements that are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those projected 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include the following general economic conditions and conditions specific to the semiconductor industry  fluctuations in customer demand  including loss of key customers  order cancellations or reduced bookings  product mix  competitive factors such as pricing pressures on existing products and the timing and market acceptance of new product introductions both by us and our competitors  our ability to have available an appropriate amount of low cost foundry production capacity in a timely manner  our foundry partners timely ability to successfully manufacture products for us using our proprietary technology  any disruptions of our foundry relationships  manufacturing efficiencies  the ability to continue effective cost reductions  currency fluctuations  the successful and timely development and introduction of new products and submicron processes  and the risk factors listed from time to time in our sec reports  including but not limited to the factors affecting future results section following and part i  item of this annual report on form k 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date hereof 
we undertake no obligation to publicly release or otherwise disclose the result of any revision to these forward looking statements that may be made as a result of events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
factors affecting future results the risks described below are not the only ones facing our company 
additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are not material may also impair our business operations 
our operating results fluctuate significantly  and an unanticipated decline in revenue may disappoint securities analysts or investors and result in a decline in our stock price 
you should not use our past financial performance to predict future operating results 
we have incurred net losses in three of the last four years 
our recent quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated  and will continue to fluctuate  due to the following factors  all of which are difficult to forecast and many of which are out of our control the cyclical nature of both the semiconductor industry and the markets addressed by our products  including the current severe business down cycle  competitive pricing pressures and related changes in selling prices  new product announcements and introductions of competing products by us or our competitors  market acceptance and subsequent design in of new products  the near and long term impact of terrorist attacks and incidents and any military response to those attacks  or a war with iraq or other countries perceived as a threat by the united states government  unpredictability of changes in demand for  or in the mix of  our products  the timing of significant orders including the fact that the sales level in any specific quarter depends significantly on orders received during that quarter  the gain or loss of significant customers  the availability  timely deliverability and cost of products manufactured on our behalf by third party suppliers  product obsolescence  lower of cost or market inventory adjustments  changes in the channels through which our products are distributed  exchange rate fluctuations  general economic  political and environmental related conditions  such as natural disasters  difficulties in forecasting  planning and managing of inventory levels  and unanticipated research and development expenses associated with new product introductions 
the exit from a portion of our memory business has changed our business model and caused a reduction in our revenues 
in the first quarter of  we announced our plan to exit from offering stand alone low density serial eeprom memory products 
we were unable to secure a buyer for the business  particularly in light of the current weak economic conditions  and substantially completed our exit from that business in the transition out of the serial eeprom memory business has reduced our revenues and we have become a smaller company with limited resources and a reduced workforce 
we may not be able to effectively 
table of contents use our limited resources to increase new product development and build our mixed signal product business 
this could cause a further decline in our revenues 
the selling prices for our products are volatile and have historically declined over the life of a product 
in addition  the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry produces fluctuations in our operating results 
the semiconductor industry has historically been cyclical  characterized by wide fluctuations in product supply and demand 
from time to time  the industry has also experienced significant downturns  often in connection with  or in anticipation of  maturing product cycles and declines in general economic conditions 
downturns are generally characterized by diminished product demand  production over capacity and accelerated decline of average selling prices  and in some cases have lasted for more than one year 
we are presently experiencing an economic downturn that is harming our business 
our success depends on a better supply and demand balance within the industry and the various electronics industries that use semiconductors  including networking  communications and industrial companies  returning to more normal buying patterns 
we do not typically enter into long term contracts with our customers and we cannot be certain as to future order levels from our customers 
the composition of our major customer base changes as the market demand for our customers products change 
a small number of customers have accounted for a substantial portion of our sales 
a reduction  delay  or cancellation of orders from a large customer could harm our business 
the loss of  or reduced orders by  any of our key customers could result in a significant decline in our sales 
we depend on distributors and manufacturers representatives to generate a majority of our sales 
distributors serve as a channel of sale to many end users of our products 
our distributors and manufacturers representatives could discontinue selling our products at any time 
the loss of any significant distributor or manufacturers representative could seriously harm our operating results by impairing our ability to sell our products 
our backlog may not result in future revenue  which would seriously harm our business 
due to possible customer changes in delivery schedules and cancellations of orders  our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period 
a reduction of backlog during any particular period  or the failure of our backlog to result in future revenue  could harm our business 
our markets are subject to rapid technological change and  therefore  our success depends on our ability to develop and introduce new products 
the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technologies  evolving and competing industry standards  changing customer needs  frequent new product introductions and enhancements  increased integration with other functions  and rapid product obsolescence 
to develop new products for our target markets  we must develop  gain access to and use leading technologies in a cost effective and timely manner and continue to expand our technical and design expertise 
in addition  we must have our products designed into our customers future products and maintain close working relationships with key customers in order to develop new products that meet their rapidly changing needs 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify new product opportunities successfully  develop and bring to market new products at competitive costs  achieve design wins or respond effectively to new technological changes or product announcements by our competitors 
furthermore  we may not be successful in developing or using new technologies or in developing new products or product enhancements that achieve market acceptance 
our pursuit of necessary technological advances may require substantial time and expense 
failure in any of these areas could harm our business  operating results and financial condition 

table of contents our future success depends in part on the continued services of our key design  engineering  sales  marketing and executive personnel and our ability to identify  recruit and retain qualified personnel 
there is significant competition for qualified personnel in the semiconductor industry  in particular for the highly skilled engineers involved in the design and development of our mixed signal products 
at times competition has been especially intense in silicon valley  where our design  research and development  and corporate headquarters are located 
the failure to recruit and retain key design engineers or other technical and management personnel would likely harm our business 
our dependence on third party foundries to manufacture our products and on subcontractors to sort  assemble and test our products and ship our products to customers subjects us to a number of risks 
we out source all manufacturing operations 
our reliance on third party foundries and subcontractors to manufacture  sort  assemble and test our products and to ship our products to customers involves the following significant risks reduced control over delivery schedules and quality  the potential lack of adequate capacity during periods of strong demand  difficulties selecting and integrating new foundries and subcontractors  limited warranties by third party manufacturers on products supplied to us  and potential increases in product costs due to capacity shortages and other factors 
these risks may lead to a possible loss of sales  increased costs  delayed product delivery or loss of competitive advantage  which would harm our profitability and customer relationships 
additionally  as we shift manufacturing of existing products between foundries and third party subcontractors  certain customers require requalification of such products prior to accepting delivery 
delays in customer qualification schedules or lack of qualification of such products could result in the loss of sales  which could seriously harm our operating results 
our operating expenses are relatively fixed  and we order materials in advance of anticipated customer demand 
therefore  we have limited ability to reduce expenses quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls 
our operating expenses are relatively fixed  and we therefore have limited ability to reduce expenses quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls 
consequently  our operating results will be harmed if our sales do not meet our revenue projections 
revenue shortfalls can occur for any of the following reasons economic slowdowns in the markets we serve  significant pricing pressures that occur because of declines in selling prices over the life of a product  the reduction  rescheduling or cancellation of customer orders  and sudden shortages of raw materials or fabrication  sort  test or assembly capacity constraints that lead our suppliers to allocate available supplies or capacity to other customers which  in turn  harms our ability to meet our sales obligations 
in addition  we typically plan our production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand  which are highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially 
from time to time  in response to anticipated long lead times to obtain inventory and materials from our outside suppliers and foundries  we order materials and produce finished products in advance of anticipated customer demand 
this advance ordering and production has resulted in  and may continue to result in  excess inventory levels or inventory write downs if expected orders fail to materialize or prices decrease substantially 

table of contents we presently have minimum wafer purchase commitments with a foundry that were made in exchange for a capacity commitment from them 
should demand for our products be less than the capacity commitment  we may be required to make payments for unused capacity which would cause our costs to increase 
because our products typically have lengthy sales cycles  we may experience substantial delays between incurring expenses related to research and development and the generation of sales 
due to the length of the product design in cycle  we usually require more than nine months to realize volume shipments after a customer first samples our product 
we first work with customers to achieve a design win  which may take three months or longer 
our customers then complete the design  testing and evaluation process and begin to ramp up production  a period which typically lasts an additional six months or longer 
as a result  a significant period of time may elapse between our research and development efforts and our realization of revenue  if any  from volume purchasing of our products by our customers 
we face intense competition from companies with significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources that could adversely affect our ability to increase sales of our products 
we compete with major semiconductor companies such as analog devices  atmel corporation  linear technology corporation and maxim integrated products  that have substantially greater financial  technical  marketing  distribution  and other resources than we do and have their own facilities for the production of semiconductor components 
in addition  our foundry partners have the right to develop and fabricate products based on our process technology 
from time to time  we may have to defend lawsuits in connection with the operation of our business 
we are subject to litigation in the ordinary course of our business 
if we do not prevail in any lawsuit which may occur we could be subject to significant liability for damages  our patents and other proprietary rights could be invalidated  and we could be subject to injunctions preventing us from taking certain actions 
if any of the above occur  our business and financial position could be harmed 
our cost of sales may increase if we are required to purchase additional manufacturing capacity in the future 
to obtain additional manufacturing capacity in the future  we may be required to make deposits  equipment purchases and loans and enter into joint ventures  equity investments or technology licenses in or with wafer fabrication companies 
these transactions could involve a commitment of substantial amounts of our capital and technology licenses in return for production capacity 
we may be required to seek additional debt or equity financing in order to secure this capacity and we may not be able to obtain such financing 
our ability to compete successfully will depend  in part  on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights  which we may not be able to do successfully 
we rely on a combination of patents  trade secrets  copyright and mask work production laws and rights  nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights 
our business  operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed by the failure to be able to protect our intellectual property 
policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property  however  is difficult  especially in foreign countries 
litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 
litigation of this type can result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and can harm our business  operating results and financial condition regardless of the outcome of the litigation 

table of contents if we or any of our foundries or third party subcontractors is accused of infringing the intellectual property rights of other parties  we may become subject to time consuming and costly litigation 
if we lose or settle claims  we could suffer a significant negative impact on our business and be forced to pay royalties and damages 
third parties have and may continue to assert that our products infringe their proprietary rights  or may assert claims for indemnification resulting from infringement claims against us 
any such claims may cause us to delay or cancel shipment of our products or pay royalties and damages that could seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  irrespective of the validity or the successful assertion of such claims  we could incur significant costs in defending against such claims 
we have received notices claiming infringement of patents from third parties with respect to certain aspects of our processes and devices  and these matters are under investigation and review 
although patent holders typically offer licenses and we have entered into such license agreements in the past  we may not be able to obtain licenses on acceptable terms  and disputes may not be resolved without costly litigation 
our business may suffer due to risks associated with international sales and operations 
sales outside of north america  based upon the location to which the product was shipped  accounted for approximately of total net sales in our international business activities are subject to a number of risks  any of which could impose unexpected costs on us that would have an adverse effect on our operating results 
these risks include difficulties in complying with regulatory requirements and standards  tariffs and other trade barriers  costs and risks of localizing products for foreign countries  severe currency fluctuations and economic deflation  reliance on third parties to distribute our products  longer accounts receivable payment cycles  potentially adverse tax consequences  adverse economic impact of terrorist attacks and incidents and any military response to those attacks  or a war with iraq or other countries perceived as a threat by the united states government and burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 
we may face interruption of production and services due to increased security measures in response to recent and potential future terrorist activities 
our business depends on the free flow of products and services through the channels of commerce 
in response to terrorists activities and threats aimed at the united states  transportation  mail  financial and other services have at times been slowed or stopped altogether 
further delays or stoppages in transportation  mail  financial or other services  particularly any such delays or stoppages which harm our ability to obtain an adequate supply of wafers and products from our foreign foundries or contractors  could harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
furthermore  we may experience an increase in operating costs  such as costs for transportation  insurance and security as a result of the activities and potential activities 
we may also experience delays in receiving payments from customers that have been affected by the terrorist activities and potential activities 
the united states economy in general is being adversely affected by terrorist activities and potential terrorist activities 
the economic downturn we are currently experiencing is adversely impacting our results of operations  and may impair our ability to raise capital or otherwise adversely affect our ability to grow our business 
moreover  we cannot determine whether other attacks may occur in the future and the effects of such attacks on our business could be severe 
our november debt financing substantially increased our indebtedness which may make it more difficult to obtain financing in the future and cause our business to suffer 
as a result of our november sale of notes and warrants  we incurred million of additional indebtedness 
the level of our indebtedness  among other things  could make it difficult for us to obtain any necessary financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service requirements or other purposes  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to changes in  our business  and make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business 
if any of these risks materialize  we may be unable to successfully execute our business plan 

table of contents our business could be harmed if the net proceeds from the november debt financing are used ineffectively 
we have flexibility in applying the net proceeds of the debt financing 
we intend to use the proceeds of this offering for working capital and general corporate purposes 
we may also use the proceeds for acquisitions  including acquisitions of intellectual property and design teams  such as our april acquisition of aip 
in addition  we may also use proceeds from the debt financing for research  development  sales and marketing and capital expenditures 
the failure to apply these net proceeds effectively could harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the conversion of our outstanding convertible debt and exercise of warrants issued in connection with our convertible debt may result in dilution to holders of our common stock and a reduction in the price of our common stock 
in november we issued million in convertible notes and related warrants 
the convertible notes enable the holders to convert principal amounts owed under the notes into an aggregate of approximately million shares of common stock at a conversion price of per share 
in connection with the issuance of the convertible notes we also issued warrants for the purchase of approximately one million shares of common stock that are exercisable at a price of per share 
if the price of our common stock exceeds the conversion price of the notes and exercise price of the warrants  holders of the notes and warrants may convert the debt and exercise the warrants 
we may force the conversion of all or a portion of the notes and warrants in certain circumstances 
our issuance of common stock at prices of per share upon conversion of the debt and per share upon exercise of the warrants may result in dilution to other holders of common stock and may cause the price of our common stock to fall 
in addition  if note and warrant holders elect to sell the common stock issued upon the conversion of the debt and exercise of the warrants  the price of our common stock may fall 
we may require additional capital in order to bring new products to market  and the issuance of new equity securities will dilute your investment in our common stock 
to implement our strategy of diversified product offerings  we need to bring new products to market 
bringing new products to market and ramping up production requires significant working capital 
we may sell additional shares of our stock or seek additional borrowings or outside capital infusions 
we cannot assure you that such financing options will be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
in addition  if we issue shares of our common stock  our shareholders will experience dilution of their investment 
changes in stock option accounting rules may adversely impact our operating results prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
technology companies like ours have a history of using broad based employee stock option programs to hire  incentivize and retain our workforce in a competitive marketplace 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  allows companies the choice of either using a fair value method of accounting for options which would result in expense recognition for all options granted  or use an intrinsic value method  as prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  with a pro forma disclosure of the impact on net income loss of using the fair value option expense recognition method 
we have elected to apply apb and accordingly we generally do not recognize any expense with respect to employee stock options as long as such options are granted at exercise prices equal to the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant 
on march   the financial accounting standards board fasb announced its plans to re deliberate the appropriate accounting for employee stock options with a goal to have one standard applicable to all companies 
the fasb announced its goal to have the new standard become effective sometime in if the fasb were to require expensing of employee stock options by all companies  our results of operations prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles would be adversely impacted 

table of contents business interruptions could harm our business 
our operations and those of our foundries and other manufacturing subcontractors are vulnerable to interruption by fire  earthquake  power loss  telecommunications failure and other events beyond our control 
our facility in the state of california may be subject to electrical blackouts due to a shortage of available electrical power 
if these blackouts were to occur  they could disrupt our operations 
business interruption insurance may not provide protection due to the deductible periods or be enough to compensate us for losses that may occur 
additionally  we have been unable to obtain earthquake insurance of reasonable costs and limits 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we have an investment portfolio of fixed income securities that are classified as available for sale securities 
these securities  like all fixed income instruments  are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
we attempt to limit this exposure by investing primarily in short term securities 
due to the short duration and conservative nature of our investment portfolio a movement of by market interest rates would not have a material impact on our operating results and the total value of the portfolio over the next fiscal year 
we are exposed to risks associated with foreign exchange rate fluctuations due to our international manufacturing and sales activities 
we generally have not hedged currency exposures 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 
all of our sales are denominated in us dollars 
an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products more expensive and therefore reduce the demand for our products 
such a decline in the demand could reduce sales and or result in operating losses
