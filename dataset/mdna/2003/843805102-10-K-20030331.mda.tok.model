item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
overview this analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of southern security life should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and financial statements and notes to the financial statements included in this report 
the company has primarily issued three types of insurance products universal life  pay whole life with an annuity rider  and final expense products 
universal life provides insurance coverage with flexible premiums  within limits  which allow policyholders to accumulate cash values 
the accumulated cash values are credited with tax deferred interest  as adjusted by the company on a periodic basis 
deducted from the cash accumulations are administrative charges and mortality costs 
should a policy surrender in its early years  the company assesses a surrender fee against the cash value accumulations based on a graded formula 
final expense products are traditional endowment type insurance policies written for the senior market 
because the products are written to a senior market they are designed to accommodate adverse health conditions 
because of the size of the policies  the products are usually issued with only limited underwriting 
the coverage size of the policy is roughly equivalent to the insured s anticipated funeral costs 
the pay whole life with an annuity rider product is designed for the student loan market 
the savings aspect of the annuity rider is marketed as a tool for parents to help fund their children s higher education 
the product is offered to parents who have children under the age of the company established a lead generation program that has been coupled with a recruiting program for new sales agents to help generate new business 
an additional source of income to the company is investment income 
the company invests those funds deposited by policyholders of universal life and annuity products in debt and equity securities  mortgage loans  and warehouse mortgage loans on a short term basis before selling the loans to investors in accordance with the requirements and laws governing life insurance companies  in order to earn interest and dividend income  a portion of which is credited back to the policyholders 
interest rates and maturities of the company s investment portfolio play an important part in determining the interest rates credited to policyholders 
product profitability is affected by several different factors  such as mortality experience actual versus expected  interest rate spreads excess interest earned over interest credited to policyholders and controlling policy acquisition costs and other costs of operation 
the results of any one reporting period may be significantly affected by the level of death claims or other policyholder benefits incurred due to the company s relatively small size 
significant accounting policies and estimates the following is a brief summary of our significant accounting policies and a review of our most critical accounting estimates 
for a complete description of our significant accounting policies  see note to our financial statements 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap  premiums and considerations received for interest sensitive products such as universal life insurance and ordinary annuities are reflected as increases in liabilities for policyholder account balances and not as revenues 
revenues reported for these products consist of policy charges for the cost of insurance  administration charges  amortization of policy initiation fees and surrender charges assessed against policyholder account balances 
surrender benefits paid relating to these products are reflected as decreases in liabilities for policyholder account balances and not as expenses 
the company receives investment income earned from the funds deposited into account balances  a portion of which is passed through to the policyholders in the form of interest credited 
interest credited to policyholder account balances and benefit claims in excess of policyholder account balances are reported as expenses in the financial statements 
premium revenues reported for traditional life insurance products are recognized as revenues when due 
future policy benefits are recognized as expenses over the life of the policy by means of the provision for future policy benefits 
the costs related to acquiring new business  including certain costs of issuing policies and other variable selling expenses principally commissions  defined as deferred policy acquisition costs  are capitalized and amortized into expense 
for traditional life products  these costs are amortized over the premium paying period of the related policies  in proportion to the ratio of annual premium revenues to total anticipated premium revenues 
such anticipated premium revenues are estimated using the same assumption used for computing liabilities for future policy benefits and are generally locked in at the date the policies are issued 
for interest sensitive products  these costs are amortized generally in proportion to expected gross profits from surrender charges and investment  mortality and expense margins 
this amortization is adjusted when the company revises the estimate of current or future gross profits or margins 
for example  deferred policy acquisition costs are amortized earlier than originally estimated when policy terminations are higher than originally estimated or when investments backing the related policyholder liabilities are sold at a gain prior to their anticipated maturity 
death and other policyholder benefits reflect exposure to mortality risk and fluctuate from year to year on the level of claims incurred under insurance retention limits 
the profitability of the company is primarily affected by fluctuations in mortality  other policyholder benefits  expense levels  interest spreads ie  the difference between interest earned on investments and interest credited to policyholders and persistency 
we have the ability to mitigate adverse experience through adjustments to credited interest rates  policyholder dividends or cost of insurance charges 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
it is reasonably possible that actual experience could differ from the estimates and assumptions utilized which could have a material impact on the financial statements 
the following is a summary of our significant accounting estimates  and critical issues that impact them fixed maturities available for sale securities available for sale are carried at fair value  with unrealized holding gains and losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive income which is included in stockholders equity after adjustment for deferred income taxes and deferred acquisition costs related to universal life products 
the company uses fair market values based on national association of insurance commissioners naic values  versus values associated with normal marketing pricing services 
the company considers the difference to be immaterial 
the company is required to exercise judgment to determine when a decline in the value of a security is other than temporary 
when the value of a security declines and the decline is determined to be other than temporary  the carrying value of the investment is reduced to its fair value and a realized loss is recorded to the extent of the decline 
deferred acquisition costs amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs for interest sensitive products is dependent upon estimates of current and future gross profits or margins on this business 
key assumptions used include the following o yield on investments supporting the liabilities o amount of interest or dividends credited to the policies o amount of policy fees and charges o amount of expenses necessary to maintain the policies  and o amount of death and surrender benefits and the length of time the policies will stay in force 
these estimates  which are revised periodically  are based on historical results and our best estimate of future expenses 
future policy benefits reserves for future policy benefits for traditional life insurance products requires the use of many assumptions  including the duration of the policies  mortality experience  expenses  investment yield  lapse rates  surrender rates  and dividend crediting rates 
these assumptions are made based upon historical experience  industry standards and a best estimate of future results and  for traditional life products  include a provision for adverse deviation 
for traditional life insurance  once established for a particular series of products  these assumptions are generally held constant 
unearned revenue the universal life products the company sells have a significant policy initiation fees front end load  which are deferred and amortized into revenues over the estimated expected gross profits from surrender charges and investment  mortality and expense margins 
the same issues that impact deferred acquisition costs would apply to unearned revenue 
results of operations compared to total revenues increased by  or  to  for fiscal year from  for fiscal year offsetting some of the increase in total revenues was a  reduction in net investment income 
net insurance revenues increased by  or  to  for fiscal year from  for fiscal year this increase was primarily the result of an increase in traditional life sales 
net investment income decreased by  or  to  for fiscal year from  for fiscal year investment yield slightly decreased for the fiscal year from in to in benefits and claims increased by  or  to  for fiscal year from  for the comparable period in the increase was primarily due to an increase in traditional life reserves and death claims 
the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs decreased by  or  to  for fiscal year from  for the comparable period in the decrease in amortization expense was in line with actuarial assumptions 
operating expenses decreased by  or  to  for fiscal year from  for the same period in the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in general office expenses 
compared to total revenues decreased by  or  to  for fiscal year from  for fiscal year contributing to this decrease in total revenues was a  reduction in net investment income 
net insurance revenues increased by  or  to  for fiscal year from  for fiscal year this increase was primarily the result of an increase in traditional life sales 
net investment income decreased by  or  to  for fiscal year from  for fiscal year investment yield slightly decreased for the fiscal year from in to in benefits and claims decreased by  or  to  for fiscal year from  for the comparable period in the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in traditional life reserves 
the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs increased by  or  to  for fiscal year  from  for the comparable period in the increase in amortization expense was in line with actuarial assumptions 
operating expenses increased by  or  to  for fiscal year from  for the same period in the increase was primarily due to increased marketing and legal expenses and an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts 
liquidity and capital resources the company attempts to match the duration of invested assets with its policyholder liabilities 
the company may sell investments other than those held to maturity in the portfolio to help in this timing  however  to date  that has not been necessary 
the company purchases short term investments on a temporary basis to meet the expectations of short term requirements of the company s products 
the company s investment philosophy is intended to provide a rate of return which will persist during the expected duration of policyholder liabilities regardless of future interest rate movements 
the company s investment policy is to invest predominantly in fixed maturity securities  mortgage loans  and warehouse mortgage loans on a short term basis before selling the loans to investors in accordance with the requirements and laws governing life insurance companies 
bonds owned by the company amounted to  as of december  as compared to  as of december  this represents and of the total investments as of december  and december   respectively 
generally  all bonds owned by the company are rated by the national association of insurance commissioners 
under this rating system  there are nine categories used for rating bonds 
at december   and at december   the company had investments in bonds in rating categories three through nine  which are considered non investment grade of  and  respectively 
if market conditions were to cause interest rates to change  the market value of the fixed income portfolio approximately million could change by the following amounts based on the respective basis point swing the change in market values were calculated using a modeling technique in millions of dollars bps bps bps bps change in market value 

the company has no other financial instruments that would be materially susceptible to market risk 
the company s insurance operations have historically provided adequate positive cash flow enabling the company to continue to meet operational needs as well as increase its investment grade securities to provide ample protection for policyholders 
the company has classified certain of its fixed income securities as available for sale  with the remainder classified as held to maturity 
however  in accordance with company policy  any such securities purchased in the future will be classified as held to maturity 
business conditions  however  may develop in the future which may indicate a need for a higher level of liquidity in the investment portfolio 
in that event the company believes it could sell short term investment grade securities before liquidating higher yielding longer term securities 
the company is subject to risk based capital guidelines established by statutory regulators requiring minimum capital levels based on the perceived risk of assets  liabilities  disintermediation  and business risk 
at december  and december   the company exceeded the regulatory criteria 
lapse rates measure the amount of insurance terminated during a particular period 
the company s lapse rate for life insurance in was as compared to a rate of for effective december   the company entered into an administrative services agreement with security national financial corporation snfc 
under the terms of the agreement  snfc has agreed to provide the company with certain defined administrative and financial services  including accounting services  financial reports and statements  actuarial  policyholder services  underwriting  data processing  legal  building management  marketing advisory services and investment services 
in consideration for the services to be provided by snfc  the company shall pay snfc an administrative services fee of  per month  provided  however  that such fee shall be reduced to zero for so long as the capital and surplus of the company is less than or equal to  unless the company and snfc otherwise agree in writing and such agreement is approved by the florida department of insurance 
the administrative services fee may be increased  beginning on january   to reflect increases in the consumer price index  over the index amount as of january  the administrative services agreement shall remain in effect for an initial term expiring on december  the term of the agreement may be automatically extended for additional one year terms unless either the company or snfc shall deliver a written notice on or before september  of any year stating to the other its desire not to extend the term of the agreement 
however  in no event can the agreement be terminated prior to december  student loans are a service the company has historically made available to the public as well as an investment 
while the company anticipates the seasonal demand for student loan funds and the subsequent sale of such loans to the student loan marketing association slma  there are times when additional funds are required to meet demand for student loans until such time as the sale thereof to slma can be completed 
in the company renewed its  line of credit with slma until in order to meet these seasonal borrowing requirements 
the company made no draws against this line of credit through december  the company began a new association with usa group  cap program in  for the purpose of making more student loan funds available without increased costs to the company 
this association aided in eliminating borrowings for and the company has leased approximately of the available space in its principal office building and does not anticipate significant capital expenditures to the rental space

in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 amortization of goodwill is precluded  however  its recoverability must be periodically at least annually reviewed and tested for impairment 
goodwill must be tested at the reporting unit level for impairment in the year of adoption  including an initial test performed within six months of adoption 
if the initial test indicates a potential impairment  then a more detailed analysis to determine the extent of impairment must be completed within twelve months of adoption 
sfas no 
also requires that useful lives for intangibles other than goodwill be reassessed and remaining amortization periods be adjusted accordingly 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
establishes an accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale that applies to all long lived assets  including discontinued operations 
sfas no 
requires that those long lived assets be measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell  whether reported in continuing operations or in discontinued operations 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
in april  fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
under historical guidance  all gains and losses resulting from the extinguishment of debt were required to be aggregated and  if material  classified as an extraordinary item  net of related income tax effect 
sfas no 
rescinds that guidance and requires that gains and losses from extinguishments of debt be classified as extraordinary items only if they are both unusual and infrequent in occurrence 
sfas no 
also amends sfas no 
 accounting for leases for the required accounting treatment of certain lease modifications that have economic effects similar to sale leaseback transactions 
sfas no 
requires that those lease modifications be accounted for in the same manner as sale leaseback transactions 
the provisions of sfas no 
related to sfas no 
are effective for transactions occurring after may  adoption of the provisions of sfas no 
related to sfas no 
did not have a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an action including certain costs incurred in a restructuring issue 
the principal difference between sfas no 
and issue is that sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred  rather than at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
sfas no 
is effective for exit or disposal activities after december  based upon a preliminary review  adoption of sfas no 
would not have a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin requires certain guarantees to be recorded at fair value and also requires a guarantor to make new disclosures  even when the likelihood of making payments under the guarantee is remote 
in general  the interpretation applies to contracts or indemnification agreements that contingently require the guarantor to make payments to the guaranteed party based on changes in an underlying that is related to an asset  liability  or an equity security of the guaranteed party 
the recognition provisions of fin are effective on a prospective basis for guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim and annual periods ending after december  based upon a preliminary review  adoption of fin not have a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure and amendment to fasb no 
 which provides three optional transition methods for entities that decide to voluntarily adopt the fair value recognition principles of sfas no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and modifies the disclosure requirements of that statement 
under the prospective method  stock based compensation expense is recognized for awards granted after the beginning of the fiscal year in which the change is made 
the modified prospective method recognizes stock based compensation expense related to new and unvested awards in the year of change equal to that which would have been recognized had sfas no 
been adopted as of its effective date  fiscal years beginning after december  the retrospective restatement method recognizes stock compensation costs for the year of change and restates financial statements for all prior periods presented as though the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
had been adopted as of its effective date 
since the company does not intend to voluntarily adopt the fair value provisions of fasb  adoption of sfas would not have a material effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the company 
however  pro forma disclosures required by sfas will be included in the company s future interim financial statements when necessary 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation  consolidation of variable interest entities fin  which requires an enterprise to assess if consolidation of an entity is appropriate based upon its variable economic interests in a variable interest entity vie 
the initial determination of whether an entity is a vie shall be made on the date at which an enterprise becomes involved with the entity 
a vie is an entity in which the equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
an enterprise shall consolidate a vie if it has a variable interest that will absorb a majority of the vie s expected losses if they occur  receive a majority of the entity s expected residual returns if they occur or both 
a direct or indirect ability to make decisions that significantly affect the results of the activities of a vie is a strong indication that an enterprise has one or both of the characteristics that would require consolidation of the vie 
fin is effective for new vie s established subsequent to january  and for existing vie s as of july  based upon a preliminary review  the adoption of fin would not have a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations as there were no material vie s identified which would require consolidation 
fin further requires the disclosure of certain information related to vie s in which the company holds a significant variable interest 
the company does not believe that it owns any such interests that require disclosure at this time
