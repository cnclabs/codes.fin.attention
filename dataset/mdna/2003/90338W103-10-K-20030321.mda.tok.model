item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements  related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report 
in addition  see forward looking statements and risk factors  earlier in this report 
general we provide comprehensive services to our network of affiliated practices  made up of more than affiliated physicians in over sites  with the mission of expanding access to and improving the quality of cancer care in local communities 
the services we offer include 
oncology pharmaceutical services 
we purchase and manage specialty oncology pharmaceuticals for our affiliated practices 
annually  we are responsible for purchasing  delivering and managing more than million of pharmaceuticals through a network of more than admixture sites  licensed pharmacies  pharmacists and pharmacy technicians 

cancer center services 
we develop and manage comprehensive  community based cancer centers  which integrate all aspects of outpatient cancer care  from laboratory and radiology diagnostic capabilities to chemotherapy and radiation therapy 
as of march   we have developed and operate integrated community based cancer centers and manage over one million square feet of medical office space 
we also have installed and manage positron emission tomography pet 

cancer research services 
we facilitate a broad range of cancer research and development activities through our network 
we contract with pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms to provide a comprehensive range of services relating to clinical trials 
we currently supervise clinical trials  supported by our network of approximately participating physicians in more than research locations 
during  we enrolled over  new patients in research studies 

other practice management services 
under our physician practice management arrangements  we act as the exclusive manager and administrator of all day to day non medical business functions connected with our affiliated practices 
as such  we are responsible for billing and collecting for medical oncology services  physician recruiting  data management  accounting  systems  and capital allocation to facilitate growth in practice operations 
we provide these services through two business models the physician practice management model  under which we provide all of the above services under a single contract with one fee based on overall performance  and the service line model  under which practices contract with the company to purchase only certain of the above services  each under a separate contract  with a separate fee methodology for each service 
we operate with our affiliated practices under three economic models 
in our physician practice management ppm business  we operate under two models the earnings model  in which management fees are based on practice earnings before income taxes  and the net revenue model  in which the management fee consists of a fixed fee  a percentage fee of the practice s net revenues in some states and  if certain performance criteria are met  a performance fee 
in certain states  our fee is a fixed fee that is subject to annual adjustment 
under the net revenue model  the practice is entitled to retain a fixed portion of its net revenue before any service fee is paid  provided that all operating expenses have been reimbursed 
under the service line structure  each service has a separate fee and fee methodology 
in our ppm business  we believe that the earnings model properly aligns practice priorities with respect to appropriate business operations and cost control  with us and the practice sharing proportionately in practice profitability  while the net revenue model results in us disproportionately bearing the impact of increases or declines in operating margins 
for this reason  we have not entered into new net revenue model agreements since and have been negotiating with practices under the net revenue model to convert to the earnings model 
since the beginning of and through december   seventeen practices accounting for of our net operating revenue in have converted to the earnings model 
of net operating revenue in the fourth quarter of is attributable to practices on the earnings model as of december  currently  of the net operating revenue for the fourth quarter of is attributable to practices that are either on the earnings model or the service line model 
in all but one net revenue model markets where we have not been successful in transitioning the practice away from a net revenue model agreement  we have recognized charges for impairments of the service agreement as a result of our projection of future results under those agreements  given declining performance trends 
in addition  in some markets we have recognized charges for impairments of cancer centers developed under the net revenue model  including some we have sold or intend to sell  based on our projection of future cash flow from these centers 
in  in connection with our introduction of our service line structure  we organized the company in four divisions oncology pharmaceutical services  cancer center services  cancer research services  and practice management services  and we manage and operate our business under these divisions 
this report includes segment financial information 
in reporting segment information  we divide results of our ppm operations into the various service line offerings that comprise the ppm relationship 
as we enter into new service line model agreements  we will report revenue from those agreements in the appropriate segment 
we are continuing to operate under the ppm model  but are affording our ppm practices the opportunity to terminate their existing service agreements  repurchase certain of their operating assets  and enter into new service line model agreements 
during  three of our ppm practices  comprising physicians  terminated their ppm agreements and entered into service line model agreements 
when a practice makes this transition  we would expect our future revenues and cash flows from that practice to be lower than under the ppm model 
in addition  we currently expect that the large majority of existing affiliated practices will remain on the ppm model for the foreseeable future 
for those practices that remain on the ppm model  we will continue to negotiate with net revenue model practices to move to the earnings model  and otherwise to manage those practices pursuant to existing agreements 
we terminated service agreements with four oncology practices during each of and for purposes of the following discussion and analysis  same practice revenues exclude the results of these disaffiliated practices  as well as the results of the service line model agreements entered into in in addition to converting three ppm practices to the service line model  we had entered into service line model agreements with four practices  comprising twenty three physicians  in new markets through december  since december   we have converted one additional ppm practice  comprising physicians  to the service line model and entered into service line model agreements with two additional practices comprising ten physicians in new markets 
we have also converted one practice  comprising six physicians to the earnings model and disaffiliated with nine other physicians from that practice 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates  including those related to service agreements  accounts receivable  intangible assets  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
however  the introduction of a new business model  the service line structure  and the coincident stress it is placing on our network  represent changes in our business and may make our historical experiences less informative in making future estimates 
actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
please refer to the notes to our consolidated financial statements  particularly note  for a more detailed discussion of such policies 
our consolidated financial statements include only the results of us oncology  inc and its wholly owned subsidiaries 
we do not include the results of our affiliated practices and the amounts they retain for physician compensation  since we have determined that our relationships with the practices under our service agreements do not warrant consolidation under the applicable accounting rules 
however  we do include all practice expenses other than physician compensation in our financial statements  since we are legally obligated for these costs under our service agreements 
this policy means that trends in  and effects of  the compensation levels of our physicians are not readily apparent from our statements of operations and comprehensive income 
however  as our discussion regarding conversions from the net revenue model emphasizes  the relationship between net patient revenue and our revenue is important in understanding our business 
for this reason we include information regarding net patient revenue and amounts retained by physicians in this report and in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
we record net patient revenue for services to patients at the time those services are rendered  based upon established or negotiated charges  reduced by management s judgment as to allowances for accounts that may be uncollectible 
when final settlements of the charges are determined  we report adjustments for any differences between actual amounts received and our estimated adjustments and allowances 
these adjustments can result in decreased net patient revenues due to a number of factors  such as a deterioration in the financial condition of payors or patients  which decreases their ability to pay 
we calculate our revenue by reducing net patient revenue by the amount retained by the practices  primarily for physician compensation 
we recognize service fees as revenue when the fees are earned and deemed realizable based upon our agreements with the practices  taking into account the priority of payments for amounts retained by net revenue model practices 
the amount retained by practices is also subject to the foregoing estimates  since it is based upon our estimates of revenue and earnings of the practice 
to the extent we are legally permitted to do so  we purchase from our affiliated practices the accounts receivable those practices generate by treating patients 
we purchase the accounts for their net realizable value  which in management s judgment is our estimate of the amount that we can collect  taking into account contractual agreements that would reduce the amount payable and allowances for accounts that may otherwise be uncollectible 
if we determine that accounts are uncollectible after we have purchased them from a practice  our contracts require that practice to reimburse us for the additional uncollectible amount 
however  such a reimbursement to us would also reduce the practice s revenue for the applicable period  since we base net patient revenue on the same estimates we use to determine the purchase price for accounts receivable 
such a reduction would reduce physician compensation and  because our management fees are partly based upon practice revenues  would also reduce our future service fees 
typically  the impact of these adjustments on our fees is not significant 
however  reimbursement rates relating to health care accounts receivable  particularly governmental receivables  are complex and change frequently  and could in the future adversely impact our ability to collect accounts receivable and the accuracy of our estimates 
our balance sheet includes intangible assets related to our service agreements  which reflect our costs of purchasing the rights to manage our affiliated practices 
from time to time  we review the carrying value of our service agreements  particularly when changes in circumstances suggest that the amount reflected on our balance sheet may not be recoverable 
in this review  we deem the amount of a service agreement asset to be unrecoverable if we anticipate that the undiscounted cash flows from the relevant service agreement over its remaining life will be less than the amount on the balance sheet 
if in management s judgment the carrying value of a service agreement is not recoverable  we reduce the value of that asset on our books to equal our estimate of discounted future cash flows from that service agreement 
in estimating future cash flows  management considers past performance as well as known trends that are likely to affect future performance 
as disclosed in forward looking statements and risk factors  there are a number of factors we cannot accurately predict that could impact practice performance and which could cause our assessment of cash flows to be incorrect 
in addition  we have to make judgments about the timing and amounts of those reductions  which are known as impairment charges  and those reductions also reduce our income 
in the same fashion  when we determine that termination of a service agreement is likely  we reduce the carrying value of certain assets related to that service agreement to reflect our judgment of reductions in the value of those assets  taking into account amounts we anticipate recovering in connection with that termination as part of our estimation of future cash flows to be realized from the related assets 
amounts we may deem recoverable in connection with a termination include estimates of amounts a practice will pay us to buy back its operating assets and working capital and  in some cases  may include liquidated damages or termination fees 
because contract terminations are negotiated transactions  we may not always estimate these amounts correctly 
we do not have the right to unilaterally terminate our service agreements without cause  and we will not terminate an agreement absent cause unless we are able to negotiate an acceptable settlement of the agreement 
sometimes we may change our determination as to whether or not we are likely to terminate an agreement due to changes in circumstances 
we periodically assess those agreements that we have determined are likely to be terminated to verify that such termination is still likely 
in addition  at the time an agreement is terminated we recognize a charge  if necessary  to eliminate any remaining carrying value for that agreement and certain related assets from our balance sheet 
since the fourth quarter of  we have recorded charges of million relating to the impairment of service agreements  either as a result of our economic analysis or termination of the agreement 
these charges have reduced net income or increased net loss in the periods in which they were recorded 
however  the reduction in value of service agreements reflected on our balance sheet also has the effect of reducing amortization expense relating to service agreements going forward 
our property and equipment are stated at cost 
depreciation of property and equipment is provided using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of three to ten years for computers and software  equipment  and furniture and fixtures  the lesser of ten years or the remaining lease term for leasehold improvements and twenty five years for buildings 
interest costs incurred during the construction of major capital additions  primarily cancer centers  are capitalized 
these lives reflect management s best estimate of the respective assets useful lives and subsequent changes in operating plans or technology could result in future impairment charges to these assets 
the carrying values of our fixed assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate their recorded cost may not be recoverable 
if the review indicates that the undiscounted cash flows from operations of the related fixed assets over the remaining useful life is expected to be less than the recorded amount of the assets  the company s carrying value of the asset will be reduced to its estimated fair value using expected cash flows on a discounted basis 
impairment analysis is highly subjective and assumptions regarding future growth rates and operating expense levels as a percentage of revenue can have significant effects on the expected future cash flows and ultimate impairment analysis 
as a result of such analysis  we recorded a charge of million during the fourth quarter of to reflect our estimation that certain of our cancer center assets had become impaired 
in connection with our introduction of the service line structure  we have announced the repositioning of our management structure to operate under distinct service lines 
financial and operations management and reporting will be conducted prospectively according to the separate service lines  even for existing affiliated practices under the ppm model 
for this reason  and to better inform investors regarding our business and the status of service line implementation  we commenced segment reporting according to service lines in the first quarter of from time to time  the financial accounting standards board  the securities and exchange commission and other regulatory bodies seek to change accounting rules  including rules applicable to our business and financial statements 
for example  during  the securities and exchange commission mandated that we change our amortization period for service agreement assets from years to years 
in that case  the change in the amortization period was implemented prospectively and did not require a restatement of our prior financial statements 
however  we cannot assure you that future changes in accounting rules would not require us to make restatements 
effective december   we amended our synthetic leasing facility to provide for a guarantee of the total cost of the properties leased to us under the lease 
as a result  those assets are now reflected as assets on our balance sheet and the total outstanding lease balance of million is reflected as indebtedness 
prior to such date  we had not reflected either the assets or indebtedness on our balance sheet  since the synthetic leasing facility was an operating lease under applicable accounting rules 
discussion of non gaap information in this report  we use certain measurements of our performance that are not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
these non gaap measures are derived from relevant items in our gaap financials 
a reconciliation of the non gaap measure to our income statement is included in this report 
management believes that the non gaap measures we use are useful to investors  since they can provide investors with additional information that is not directly available in a gaap presentation 
in all events  these non gaap measures are not intended to be a substitute for gaap measures  and investors are advised to review such non gaap measures in conjunction with gaap information provided by us 
the following is a discussion of these non gaap measures 
net operating revenue is our revenue  plus amounts retained by our affiliated physicians 
we believe net operating revenue is useful to investors as an indicator of the overall performance of our network  since it represents the total revenue of all of our ppm practices  without taking into account what portion of that is retained as physician compensation 
in addition  by comparing trends in net operating revenue to trends in our revenue  investors are able to assess the impact of trends in physician compensation on our overall performance 
net patient revenue is the net revenue of our affiliated practices under the ppm model for services rendered to patients by those affiliated practices 
net patient revenue will also include the net revenue relating to radiation of practices that enter into our cancer center services agreement 
net patient revenue is the largest component in of net operating revenue 
it is a useful measure because it gives investors a sense of the overall operations of our ppm network and other business lines in which our revenue is derived from payments for medical services to patients and in which we are responsible for billing and collecting such amounts 
ebitda is earnings before taxes  interest  depreciation and amortization  impairment  restructuring and other charges and extraordinary loss 
we believe ebitda is a commonly applied measurement of financial performance 
we believe ebitda is useful to investors because it gives a measure of operational performance without taking into account items that we do not believe relate directly to operations such as depreciation and amortization  which are typically based on predetermined asset lives  and thus not indicative of operational performance  or that are subject to variations that are not caused by operational performance such as tax rates or interest rates 
ebitda is a key tool used by management in assessing our business performance both as a whole and with respect to individual sites or product lines 
field ebitda is ebitda plus physician compensation and corporate general and administrative expenses 
like net operating revenue  field ebitda provides an indication of our overall network operational performance  without taking into account the effect of physician compensation and corporate general and administrative expense 
we exclude unusual charges from ebitda and field ebitda because we view these charges as extraneous to our core operations on a going forward basis 
the unusual charges relate principally to our transitional activity and strategic repositioning  and are discussed in more detail in this report under the caption restructuring  impairment and other charges 
results of operations we were affiliated including under the service line structure with the following number of physicians by specialty as of december   and december  medical oncologists radiation oncologists diagnostic radiologists other oncologists the following table sets forth sources of the growth of the number of physicians affiliated with us year ended december  affiliated physicians  beginning of period physician practice affiliations recruited physicians physician practice separations retiring other affiliated physicians  end of period in  all new practice affiliations were under the service line 
the following table sets forth the number of cancer centers and pet units managed by us as march  and december   and march  december  cancer centers pet units the following table sets forth the key operating statistics as a measure of the volume of services provided by the practices year ended december  medical oncology visits    radiation treatments    pet scans    new patients enrolled in research studies    the following table sets forth the percentages of revenue represented by certain items reflected in the our statement of operations and comprehensive income 
the following information should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this report

net operating revenue includes two components net patient revenue and our other revenue 
net patient revenue 
we report net patient revenue for those business lines under which our revenue is derived from payments for medical services to patients that we are responsible for billing those patients 
currently  net patient revenue consists of patient revenue of affiliated practices under the ppm model 
net patient revenue also will include revenues of practices that enter into agreements under the cancer center services service line 

other revenue 
other revenue is revenue derived from sources other than services to patients by affiliated practices 
other revenue includes revenue from pharmaceutical research  informational services and activities as a group purchasing organization 
other revenue also includes revenues from pharmaceutical services rendered by us under our oncology pharmaceutical services service line agreements  interest income  and gains and losses from asset sales 
the following table shows the components of our net operating revenue for the years ended december  and in thousands year ended december  net patient revenue   other revenue   net operating revenue   net patient revenue is recorded when services are rendered based on established or negotiated charges reduced by contractual adjustments and allowances for doubtful accounts 
differences between estimated contractual adjustments and final settlements are reported in the period when final settlements are determined 
net operating revenue is reduced by amounts retained by the practices under our service agreements to arrive at the amount we report as revenue in our financial statements 
net operating revenue increased from  million in to  million in  an increase of million  or 
same practice net operating revenue which excludes the results of practices with which we disaffiliated since january  and our service line practices increased from  million in to  million in  an increase of million  or 
revenue growth was primarily attributable to increased utilization of more expensive chemotherapy agents and additional supportive care drugs  rather than increased patient volume 
during  medical oncology visits decreased over the prior year 
in the cancer center services product line  revenues declined 
in january  medicare implemented reductions in reimbursement for radiation therapy that impacted medicare radiation reimbursement by approximately and certain commercial payors made similar reductions  which reductions were not fully offset by volume increases 
also  we disaffiliated from a radiation oncology facility during the third quarter and sold technical assets with respect to certain technical radiology revenues during the second quarter 
revenues related to pet services and diagnostic ct imaging increased 
pet scans increased from  in to  in  an increase of  or 
the increase in the number of pet scans is attributable to our opening four pet units since january   as well as growth of in the number of treatments on the twelve pet units that were operational during we currently have nine cancer centers and six pet installations in various stages of development 
we expect to open seven cancer centers and add nine pet sites of service during the following table shows our net operating revenue by segment for the year ended december  in thousands 
since this is the first year in which we have reportable segments  and for which sufficient information is now available to permit such reporting  no prior year comparable information is available year ended december  oncology pharmaceutical services  other practice management services  medical oncology  cancer center services  other  currently of our net operating revenue is derived under the ppm model 
during  five net revenue model practices accounting for of our net operating revenue for converted to the earnings model 
since the beginning of and through december   seventeen practices accounting for of net operating revenue in have converted from the net revenue model to the earnings model 
as of december   twenty five service agreements were on the earnings model and twelve service agreements were on the net revenue model 
in addition during  we transitioned three ppm practices from the earnings model to the service line structure and commenced operations at four new practices under the service line structure 
also  during  we disaffiliated with four practices consisting of a total of twenty three physicians  which had been operating under the net revenue model 
these practices represented of our net operating revenue in in addition  one practice consisting of eleven physicians converted to the service line structure as of february  revenue 
our revenue is net operating revenue  less the amount of net operating revenue retained by our affiliated practices under ppm service agreements 
the following presents the amounts included in the determination of our revenue in thousands year ended december  net operating revenue   amounts retained by practices   revenue   amounts retained by practices increased from million in to million in  an increase of million  or 
such increase in amounts retained by practices is directly attributable to the growth in net patient revenue combined with the increase in profitability of affiliated practices 
amounts retained by practices as a percentage of net operating revenue increased from to in and  respectively  as a result of increased profitability and improved operating margins before physician compensation and general and administrative expenses 
revenue increased from  million in to  million in  an increase of million  or 
revenue growth was caused by increases in revenues attributable to pharmaceuticals 
the following table shows our revenue by segment for the year ended december  in thousands 
since this is the first year in which we have reportable segments  and for which sufficient information is now available to permit such reporting  no prior year information is provided see note to consolidated financial statements 
year ended december  oncology pharmaceutical services  other practice management services  medical oncology  cancer center services  other  medicare and medicaid are the practices largest payors 
during  approximately of the practices net patient revenue was derived from medicare and medicaid payments and was so derived in the previous year 
this percentage varies among practices 
medicare and medicaid generally reimburse at lower rates than commercial payors  so this percentage increase adversely affects our margins 
no other single payor accounted for more than of our revenues in and pharmaceuticals and supplies 
pharmaceuticals and supplies expense  which includes drugs  medications and other supplies used by the practices  increased from million in to million in  an increase of million  or 
as a percentage of revenue  pharmaceuticals and supplies increased from in to in the increase was attributable to an increase in the percentage of our revenue attributable to pharmaceuticals as a result of increased use of supportive care drugs and utilization of more expensive chemotherapy agents and to a lesser extent the conversion of three affiliated practices to  and the addition of four practices in new markets under  the service line structure 
such increases were partially offset by more favorable drug pricing with respect to some drugs 
we expect that third party payors will continue to negotiate or mandate the reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals and supplies  with the goal of lowering reimbursement rates  and that such lower reimbursement rates together with shifts in revenue mix may continue to adversely impact our margins with respect to such items 
in both regulatory and litigation activity  federal and state governments are focusing on decreasing the amount governmental programs pay for drugs 
current governmental focus on average wholesale price awp as a basis for reimbursement could also lead to a wide ranging reduction in the reimbursement for pharmaceuticals by both governmental and commercial payors 
commercial payors also continue to try to implement both voluntary and mandatory programs in which the practice must obtain drugs they administer to patients from a third party and that third party  rather than the practice  receives payment for the drugs directly from the payor  and to otherwise reduce drug expenditures 
we continue to believe that single source drugs  possibly including oral drugs  will continue to be introduced at a rapid pace  thus further negatively impacting margins 
in response to this decline in margin relating to certain pharmaceutical agents  we have adopted several strategies 
the successful conversion of net revenue model practices to the earnings model will help reduce the impact of the increasing cost of pharmaceuticals and supplies and the effect of reduced levels of reimbursement 
likewise  the implementation of the service line structure should have a similar effect  since our revenues and earnings are not directly dependent on pharmaceutical margins of practices under that model 
in addition  we have numerous efforts under way to reduce the cost of pharmaceuticals by negotiating discounts for volume purchases and by streamlining processes for efficient ordering and inventory control and are assessing other strategies to address this trend 
we also continue to seek to expand into areas that are less affected by lower pharmaceutical margins  such as radiation oncology and diagnostic radiology 
however  as long as pharmaceuticals continue to become a larger part of our revenue mix as a result of changing usage patterns rather than growth of our business  we believe that our overall margins will continue to be adversely impacted 
in addition  the pharmacy service line is a lower margin business than our ppm model 
although we believe it reduces risk in certain respects  since our compensation is not directly based on physician reimbursement and capital requirements are lower  to the extent we add additional service line practices under the pharmacy service line  we would expect our overall margins to be adversely impacted 
field compensation and benefits 
field compensation and benefits  which includes salaries and wages of our field level employees and the practices employees other than physicians  increased from million in to million in  an increase of million or 
as a percentage of revenue  field compensation and benefits decreased from in to in the increase in costs is attributed to increases in employee compensation rates to address shortages of certain key personnel such as oncology nurses and radiation and radiology physicists  dosimetrists and technicians 
we continue to experience a severe shortage of qualified radiation personnel  with a vacancy rate up to 
this scarcity of full time employees requires us to hire more expensive temporary employees and to incur significant costs in recruitment efforts 
the decrease as a percentage of revenue is attributable to pharmaceutical revenues increasing at a more rapid rate than compensation and benefits 
other field costs 
other field costs  which consist of rent  utilities  repairs and maintenance  insurance and other direct field costs  increased from million in to million in  an increase of million or 
as a percentage of revenue  other field costs decreased from in to in the decrease as a percentage of revenue in is attributable to pharmaceuticals revenues increasing at a more rapid rate than other field costs 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in  an increase of million  or 
in  several new personnel positions have been created to help manage and support our introduction of the service line structure combined with the implementation of our program to provide industry advisory services to pharmaceutical companies and other vendors 
we anticipate incurring additional general and administrative costs during early  as we add additional resources in our sales and marketing areas in connection with the foregoing business lines 
as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative costs decreased from in to in overall  we experienced steady adjusted operating margins from to  with earnings before taxes  interest  depreciation and amortization  impairment  restructuring and other charges and extraordinary loss ebitda  as a percentage of revenue  remaining at for both and the following is the ebitda of our operations by operating segment for the year ended december  in thousands

year ended december  oncology pharmaceutical services  other practice management services  medical oncology  cancer center services  other  general and administrative expenses  the following is a reconciliation of ebitda to consolidated loss from operations in thousands year ended december  ebitda  depreciation and amortization  impairment  restructuring and other charges  net  loss from operations  impairment  restructuring and other charges 
during  we incurred impairment and restructuring costs related to transitional activity  including the following 
termination of service agreements related to the conversion of ppm practices to the service line model and in connection with practice disaffiliations  
gains and losses related to sales of assets back to practices converting to the service line model or in connection with practice disaffiliations  
impairment of intangible assets related to net revenue model service agreements  
impairment of cancer center fixed assets  
centralization of accounting and financial processes  and 
write off of an affiliate receivable 
during  we disaffiliated with four practices  terminated a service agreement in one market with respect to certain radiology sites  and converted three practices to the service line 
each of these transactions involved a termination of service agreement and a repurchase of assets by the practice 
in each case  any consideration still owing to the physicians for their initial affiliation was either accelerated or forfeited  and in some of the transactions we were paid additional fees for the transaction 
during  we also recorded charges related to the impairment of certain net revenue model service agreements 
from time to time  we evaluate our intangible assets for impairment  which involves an analysis comparing the aggregate expected future cash flows under the agreement to its carrying value as an intangible asset on our balance sheet 
in estimating future cash flows  we consider past performance as well as known trends that are likely to affect future performance 
in some cases  we also take into account our current activities with respect to that agreement that may be aimed at altering performance or reversing trends 
all of these factors used in our estimates are subject to error and uncertainty 
during  we recognized impairment  restructuring and other charges of million  net  and during  we recognized impairment  restructuring and other charges of million  net  as follows in thousands year ended december  impairment charges   restructuring charges   other charges   total   the following is a detailed description of the charges during and in thousands year ended december  impairment charges write off of service agreements  impairment of cancer center fixed assets  gain on sale of practice assets   restructuring charges personnel reduction costs   consulting costs for implementing service line  closure of facilities  other charges write off of an affiliate receivable  practice accounts receivable and fixed asset write off  other  impairment charges generally accepted accounting principles require that companies periodically assess their long lived assets for potential impairment 
in accordance with this requirement  from time to time we evaluate our intangible assets for impairment 
for each of our service agreements  this analysis involves comparing the aggregate expected future cash flows under the agreement to its carrying value as an intangible asset on our balance sheet 
in estimating future cash flows  we consider past performance as well as known trends that are likely to affect future performance 
in some cases we also take into account our current activities with respect to that agreement that may be aimed at altering performance or reversing trends 
all of these factors used in our estimates are subject to error and uncertainty 
in  we noted a significant increase in operating costs  most notably the cost of pharmaceuticals  which increased by as a percentage of revenue from to we believed that some of this increase was attributable either to inefficiencies arising directly from the aor prn merger and the integration of the formerly separate companies  or from delays in implementation of cost containment strategies during the first half of pending consummation of the merger 
in addition  we continued to believe that we had developed effective strategies to diversify revenues away from medical oncology and to curtail the increase in drug prices and otherwise contain costs 
as the remaining lives of our service agreements were substantially longer than their estimated recovery periods  and because we believed that we would be able to reverse or slow many of the negative cost trends  we did not believe any impairment provisions were necessary at that time 
during  we continued to experience adverse trends in operating margins 
although our strategies to lower pharmaceutical costs slowed the rate of increase  pharmaceutical costs continued to rise  reducing operating margins during single source drug use continued to grow  and treatment protocols involving a greater number of different  expensive drugs for each patient were also becoming more common 
based upon the significant increase in the number of oncological pharmaceuticals which would upon approval be new single source drugs in development  we believed the trend towards increased use of lower margin pharmaceuticals would continue 
we also experienced increased pressure on reimbursement from payors  including significant initiatives with respect to government programs  to reduce oncology reimbursements  particularly for pharmaceuticals 
moreover  we became increasingly aware of growing complexity in the administrative aspects of the practices and rising personnel costs in the health care sector  neither of which were being effectively slowed or stopped by anticipated economies of scale and other efficiencies arising from the merger 
even though the practices profitability continued to increase significantly during this period  because practices that operate under the net revenue model do not share in increasing operating costs  we shared disproportionately in the decline in operating margins 
based upon these trends our management determined during the latter part of that the cost of operating in the oncology sector was continuing to increase and that this trend was likely to continue  regardless of our action  in the next several years 
for this reason  we determined that rising costs  and our disproportionately sharing in these costs under the net revenue model  would be an integral part of our forecast of future cash flows in an impairment analysis with respect to our service agreements 
in addition  we have from time to time recognized charges for impairment of service agreements we have terminated  either in connection with a conversion to the service line model or otherwise  or in markets where we have reduced the scope of services or disaffiliated with physicians 
during  we recognized a a non cash pretax charge of million in the fourth quarter related to impairment of a service agreement under which we had significantly reduced the scope of our services during the year  based upon our analysis of future cash flows under likely future scenarios for that agreement  b a non cash  pretax charge of million during the third quarter comprising i a million charge related to a ppm service agreement that was terminated in connection with conversion to the service line model  ii a million charge related to three net revenue model service agreements that became impaired during the third quarter based upon our analysis of projected cash flows under those agreements  taking into account developments in those markets during the third quarter and iii a million charge related to a group of physicians under a net revenue model service agreement with which we disaffiliated during the third quarter  and c a non cash  pretax charge of million during the second quarter comprising i a million charge related to a net revenue model service agreement that became impaired during the second quarter based upon our analysis of projected cash flows under that agreement  taking into account developments in that market during the second quarter and ii a million charge related to two ppm service agreements that were terminated in connection with conversions to the service line model 
during the fourth quarter of  we recognized a charge of million related to impairment of fixed assets 
this charge was based on our estimate of future cash flows from our cancer center assets  taking into account developments during the fourth quarter 
in assessing likely future performance  we make estimates of the likelihood and impact of possible operational improvements  as well as looking at existing performance 
if we have made a determination to dispose of a center  our valuation is based upon the value of that disposition 
in making estimates regarding possible improvements in performance  we take into consideration the economic arrangement with the practice  as well as certain qualitative considerations regarding the continued growth prospects of the practice  internal practice management  and our relationship with the practice 
as part of the introduction of the service line strategy in late  this year we began managing our business through our service lines oncology pharmaceutical services  cancer center services  cancer research services  and physician practice management 
prior to  we managed our business on a practice by practice basis  viewing cancer centers as an integrated part of a long term ppm relationship 
through our service line initiative  we developed separate management and systems for our service lines  including our cancer center operations 
as a result  we commenced segment reporting at the beginning of  and during assembled management  systems and personnel  both regionally and at the corporate level  to manage that product line independently 
during the third and fourth quarter of  we began to monitor the financial performance of each cancer center individually 
our improved product line financial reporting  combined with the detailed financial monitoring of each cancer center  provided us with more detailed information and effective analysis in estimating future cash flows for each cancer center 
this analysis and information was used in our assessment of the cancer center fixed assets described above 
all of the impaired assets were developed for practices managed under the net revenue model at the outset of their development 
the revenue model did not properly align incentives or encourage cost control and caused several centers constructed under that model to have higher cost structures than our other centers 
during  as groups that had converted to the earnings model continued to analyze their cost structures in more detail  and as management provided financial analyses of individual centers  some practices voiced concern regarding financial performance of these centers 
during the fourth quarter of  we determined to close certain centers and came to an agreement with some of those practices  as to how costs of certain underperforming centers are borne 
we will  from time to time  take actions or make adjustments to our agreements with practices that result in what we believe to be short term adverse impact to us  in order to enhance long term value 
the million fixed asset charge during the fourth quarter of was based upon our determination as a result of transitional activity during that quarter  that assets relating to of our cancer centers had become partially impaired 
a summary of the activity involved is as follows 
million relates to eight cancer centers that became impaired during the fourth quarter based upon our decision to close or dispose of such centers  comprising i two cancer centers we sold  one we leased to a departing physician  one we closed  and two we agreed to close and replace for a practice that will in part convert to the earnings model and in part disaffiliate in the first quarter of  ii one cancer center we determined to sell in connection with the anticipated departure of radiation oncologists from a group we expect to convert to the service line in the first half of  and iii one cancer center we closed as part of a consolidation of services within one market 

million relates to five cancer centers used by groups that had converted to the earnings model 
the centers became impaired as a result of our ongoing discussions with physician practices during the latter part of regarding underperforming centers 
in some of these discussions we have agreed to assume greater liability for underperforming assets or for cancer center closures 
three of these centers were opened during  and we generally cannot fully assess the long term value of a center until after a ramp up period of to months 

million relates to three cancer centers that became impaired during the fourth quarter  comprising i one center in which we determined that our relationship with the practice  as well as the announced departure of several physicians from that practice  meant improvement in substandard performance was unlikely and ii two centers in which management had determined that its remedial actions taken since opening had been ineffective and additional remedial actions were unlikely to improve performance 
to implement the closures and sales of cancer centers described above  as well as future similar activity  we amended our synthetic lease facility to afford us the flexibility to sell and transfer individual assets within the leasing facility  which that facility did not previously permit 
the amendment became effective december   and resulted in an increase in the amount we guaranteed under the leasing facilty  which caused a change in our accounting for the leasing facility from an operating lease to long term debt appearing on our balance sheet 
this change is discussed in more detail under the heading liquidity and capital resources 
since the impairment related to events during the fourth quarter of  we had not previously recorded a charge for impairment of the lease assets or a liability for any residual value guarantee as such amounts were not probable previously 
the million net gain on sale of practice assets during consisted of a million net gain on sale of practice assets during the third quarter comprising a net proceeds of million paid by converting and disaffiliating physicians  b a million net recovery of working capital assets  partially offset by a million net charge arising from our accelerating consideration that would have been due to physicians in the future in connection with those transactions  and c a million net gain on sale of practice assets during the second quarter 
during that quarter  we terminated a service agreement as it related to certain radiology sites and sold the related assets  including the right to future revenues attributable to radiology technical fee revenue at those sites  in exchange for delivery to us of million shares of our common stock 
in connection with that sale  we also recognized a write off of a receivable of million due from the physicians and made a cash payment to the buyer of million to reflect purchase price adjustments during the third quarter 
the transaction resulted in a million gain based on the market price of our common stock as of the date of the termination 
this gain was partially offset by a million net impairment of working capital assets relating to service line conversions  disaffiliations and potential disaffiliations 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a net gain on separation of million  pre tax  on the termination of certain service agreements and related assets 
included in this net gain is approximately million arising from final settlements with several practices with which we terminated our relationships during where the ultimate settlements were more beneficial to us than we estimated and resulted in our recognizing in the fourth quarter of the forgiveness of million in notes payable by us to physicians  the waiver by the physicians of their rights to receive million of our common stock previously recognized by us as an obligation when we affiliated with the physicians  and additional consideration received by us in connection with the terminations of million in excess of the carrying value of the net assets of the terminated practices  less a charge of million recognized during the fourth quarter of for the difference between the carrying value of certain assets and the amount we expect to realize upon those assets  as determined in the fourth quarter of restructuring charges in the fourth quarter of  we comprehensively analyzed our operations and cost structure  with a view to repositioning ourselves to effectively execute its strategic and operational initiatives 
this analysis focused on our non core assets and activities we had determined were not consistent with our strategic direction 
as a result of this analysis  during the fourth quarter of  we recorded restructuring charges of million comprising i million related to abandonment of information systems initiatives  including clinical information systems and e commerce initiatives  ii million impairment of a home health business  iii million related to contractual severance of an executive position and iv million related to abandonment of leased and owned facilities for remaining lease obligations and the difference in the net book value of the owned real estate and its expected fair value 
details of the restructuring charge activity relating to that charge in are as follows accrual at accrual at december  payments december  severance of employment agreements site closures  total  during the first quarter of  we announced plans to further reduce overhead costs and recognized additional pre tax restructuring charges of million  consisting of i a million charge relating to the elimination of approximately personnel positions  ii a million charge for remaining lease obligations and related improvements at sites we decided to close and iii a million charge relating to abandoned software applications 
details of the restructuring charge activity relating to that charge in are as follows accrual at accrual at december  payments december  costs related to personnel reductions closure of facilities  total  in connection with our focus on internal operations and cost structure  management commenced an initiative to further centralize certain accounting and financial reporting functions at our corporate headquarters in houston  texas  resulting in charges for personnel reduction costs of million in  all of which was paid in during  we also recognized restructuring charges of million in consulting fees related to its introduction of the service line model 
other charges during the third quarter of  we recognized an million write off of an million receivable due to us from one of our affiliated practices 
in the course of our ppm activities  we advance amounts to physician groups and retain fees based upon our estimates of practice performance 
subsequent events and related adjustments may result in the creation of a receivable with respect to certain amounts advanced 
during the third quarter  we made the determination that such amounts owed by physician practices to us had become uncollectible due to  among other things the age of the receivable and circumstances relating to practice operations 
in the fourth quarter of  we recognized unusual charges including i million of practice accounts receivable and fixed asset write off  ii a million charge related to our estimated exposure to losses under an insurance policy where the insurer has become insolvent see note  and iii million of consulting costs incurred in connection with development of our service line structure 
the negative impact of these charges was wholly offset by the net gain on separation of million we recognized during the fourth quarter of  which is discussed above in impairment charges 
interest 
net interest expense increased from million in to in  an increase of million or 
as a percentage of revenue  net interest expense decreased from in to in on february   we refinanced our indebtedness by issuing million in senior subordinated notes due  repaying in full our existing senior secured notes and terminating our existing credit facility 
our previously existing million senior secured notes bore interest at a fixed rate of and would have required a million repayment of principal in each of the years through higher levels of debt during  as compared to the same period in  combined with the increased rate of interest contributed to the increase in interest expense 
income taxes 
for  we recognized a tax benefit of million  after extraordinary loss  resulting in an effective tax rate of  compared to for the same prior year period 
the tax benefit is a result of the impairment and restructuring charges discussed above 
the effective tax rate in reflects management s estimate of the limited extent to which we will be able to deduct the impairment  restructuring and other charges at the state level 
extraordinary loss on early extinguishment of debt 
during the first quarter of  we recorded an extraordinary loss of million  before income taxes of million  in connection with the early extinguishment of our million senior secured notes due and our existing credit facility 
the loss consisted of payment of a prepayment penalty of million on the senior secured notes and a write off of unamortized deferred financing costs of million related to the terminated debt agreements 
in september  we announced in a press release that our introduction of the service line structure and transition away from the net revenue model  and the related realignment of our business would cause us to record unusual charges for write offs of service agreements and other assets and other charges 
these charges include the impairment  restructuring and other charges and extraordinary loss we have recorded during through december   we recorded million in unusual cash charges and million in unusual non cash charges in connection with our transition process 
in that september press release  we disclosed that if all of our ppm model practices converted to the service line we would anticipate incurring approximately million in such charges 
although that analysis would still hold true if all practices converted  we do not believe full conversion is likely and do not believe that we are likely to recognize the full million amount in connection with our transition 
the principal category of such charges related to the impairment of service agreements 
service agreements were impaired either because of a termination of the agreement both in disaffiliations and conversions to the service line or because we determined that the agreement was impaired based on expected future cash flow under the agreement 
the latter category of impairment related exclusively to net revenue model practices 
currently  our balance sheet reflects million in service agreements under the net revenue model and million under the earnings model 
based upon the potential for continued declining performance  we would anticipate that the net revenue model agreements  if not converted to the earnings model  could become impaired in the future 
at present  we would not expect earnings model agreements to become impaired  except in the case of disaffiliations or service line conversions 
accordingly  management currently expects that the total amount of charges in connection with our transition is unlikely to exceed million  absent additional disaffiliations or conversions 
net income net loss 
net income decreased from million  or per diluted share  in to a net loss of million  or per share after extraordinary loss  in  a decrease of million 
net income as a percentage of revenue changed from in to in included in net income for are impairment  restructuring and other charges of million and an extraordinary loss on early extinguishment of debt of million  net of income taxes 
excluding the extraordinary loss and impairment  restructuring and other charges  net income for would have been million  which represents earnings per share of 
included in net income for were pre tax restructuring charges of million 
excluding the restructuring charges  net income for would have been million  which represents earnings per share of 
compared to in  our revenue increased to  million  an increase of  while our operating margin which we define as earnings before income taxes  interest  depreciation  amortization  bad debt expense  gain on investment in common stock and impairment  restructuring and other charges as a percentage of revenue declined from in to in  excluding unusual charges of million and million  respectively  included in impairment  restructuring and other charges  million for bad debt expense in  and million for gain on investment in common stock in the factors that contributed to the decrease in operating margins were i the continued increase in utilization of more expensive single source drugs  ii increase in personnel costs  iii practices under the net revenue model not bearing their proportionate share of increased operating costs and iv reduction in management fees resulting from conversions to the earnings model and other service agreement modifications and terminations 
revenue 
our revenue is net operating revenue  less the amount of net operating revenue retained by our affiliated physician practices under the ppm service agreements 
revenue increased from  million for to  million for  an increase of million  or 
the increase in revenue is attributable to the growth in net operating patient revenue offset by amounts retained by the practices 
the following presents the manner in which our revenue is determined in thousands year ended december  net operating revenue   amounts retained by practices   revenue   net patient revenue for services to patients by the affiliated practices is recorded when services are rendered based on established or negotiated charges reduced by contractual adjustments and allowances for accounts that may be uncollectible 
differences between estimated contractual adjustments and final settlements are reported in the period when final settlements are determined 
net patient revenue of the practices is reduced by amounts retained by the practices under our service agreements to arrive at our service fee revenue 
during  we agreed to terminate the service agreements with four affiliated practices 
we recognized revenue of million during from these service agreements 
for practices managed throughout and  net patient revenue in increased million  or  as compared to net patient revenue growth was attributable to increases in i anticancer pharmaceuticals usage  ii an increase in medical oncology visits and iii increased radiation and diagnostic revenue 
the total number of network physicians essentially remained flat 
the increase in anticancer pharmaceuticals revenue was attributable primarily to a continued increase in utilization of more expensive  lower margin  principally single source drugs and a modest increase in medical oncology visits 
the increase in radiation and diagnostic revenue was attributable to the opening of five additional cancer centers and eight additional pet centers during and growth in revenue of cancer centers opened prior to amounts retained by practices increased from million for to million for  an increase of million  or 
adjusting for the disaffiliations mentioned above  amounts retained by the practices increased million  or  as compared to the previous year 
such increases in amounts retained by practices are directly attributable to the growth in net patient revenue  combined with the increase in profitability of practices 
practices compensation under the net revenue model is not proportionately impacted by increasing operating costs 
as a result  we announced in november our initiative to convert all net revenue model agreements to earnings model agreements 
we believe the earnings model properly aligns practice priorities with proper cost control  with the practice and us sharing proportionately in revenue  operating costs and profitability 
as of march   fourteen practices accounting for of our affiliated practices net patient revenue in had converted from the net revenue model to the earnings model since december  of our revenue for was derived from practices with earnings model service agreements as of december   and was derived from practices with net revenue model service agreements as of such date  as compared to and  respectively  in amounts retained by practices decreased from of net patient revenue for to for such decrease is mainly attributable to a higher percentage of our revenue being derived from earnings model service agreements as a result of conversions of net revenue model agreements to the earnings model and terminations of agreements with net revenue model practices 
in converting practices to the earnings model  we are attempting to move towards a standardized service fee equal to of practice earnings  subject to adjustments 
we are also providing certain economic incentives within our service agreements  both in connection with earnings model conversions and otherwise  to meet or exceed predetermined thresholds for return on invested capital 
in some cases  the conversions and incentives may represent a reduction in management fees that would have been realizable under the previously existing fee arrangement 
medicare and medicaid are the practices largest payors 
during  approximately of the practices net patient revenue was derived from medicare and medicaid payments and and was so derived in and  respectively 
this percentage varies among practices 
no other single payor accounted for more than of our revenues in  or pharmaceuticals and supplies 
pharmaceuticals and supplies expense used by the practices  increased from million in to million in  an increase of million  or 
as a percentage of revenue  pharmaceuticals and supplies increased from in to in this increase was primarily due to i a shift in the revenue mix to a higher percentage of revenue from drugs  ii increases in acquisition prices of drugs  iii a shift to lower margin drugs and iv with respect to practices operating under the net revenue model  our disproportionately bearing the impact of increasing operating costs 
field compensation and benefits 
field compensation and benefits increased from million in to million in  an increase of million or 
as a percentage of revenue  field compensation and benefits increased from in to in the increase is attributed to increases in employee compensation rates to address shortages of certain key personnel such as oncology nurses and radiation technicians 
other field costs 
other field costs increased from million in to million in  an increase of million or 
as a percentage of revenue  other field costs decreased from in to in due to economies of scale 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses decreased from million in to million in  a decrease of million  or 
as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative costs decreased from in to for we restructured general and administrative departments in december and march  eliminating approximately positions  closing offices and abandoning information system initiatives  which resulted in restructuring and other charges recorded in the fourth quarter of and first quarter of see impairment  restructuring and other charges 
bad debt expense 
in late  we installed a patient billing system in thirteen practices with approximately million in annual net patient revenues 
during  we experienced limitations in this system that caused significant delays and errors in patient billing and collection processes 
although the vendor assisted in correcting some deficiencies in the billing system  collecting some patient accounts became impractical 
in the fourth quarter of  we determined that the system problems required a million charge for bad debt expense 
because of the numerous distractions borne by the practices in the system conversion  we elected not to include this amount in the computation of practice results 
in connection with a settlement with the vendor of that system  that vendor agreed to provide us with a replacement system at significantly reduced rates 
impairment  restructuring and other charges 
during  we recognized impairment  restructuring and other charges of million  net  and during  we recognized impairment  restructuring and other charges of approximately million 
the charges are summarized in the following table and discussed in more detail below in thousands year ended december  impairment charges   restructuring charges   other charges   total   impairment charges in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a net gain on separation of million  pre tax  on the termination of certain service agreements and related assets 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a pre tax  non cash charge of million related to the impairment of certain service agreements and other assets  as follows in thousands impairment of service agreements  impairment of assets gain on separation related to termination of service agreements   total   statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of fas  requires that companies periodically assess their long lived assets for potential impairment 
in accordance with this requirement  from time to time we evaluate our intangible assets for impairment 
we discuss in our comparison of to our process for analysis of our service agreements 
in the fourth quarter of  our impairment review focused primarily on net revenue model service agreements 
using then current assumptions  many of our net revenue model service agreements would contribute decreasing cash flows in the immediate future and then begin contributing negative cash flows 
although management commenced during the fourth quarter of an initiative to convert net revenue model agreements to earnings model agreements  there can be no assurance as to the number of conversions that will be achieved 
the charge for impairment of service agreements for related to thirteen practices with a total net book value of million as of december  prior to the impairment charge 
certain of the projected cash flows related to our service agreements may result in negative cash flows if cost increases continue 
no provision has been made for potential losses under these contracts as such amounts are not yet probable and reasonably estimable 
we had impaired assets of approximately million during for the difference between the carrying value of the assets related to certain practices with which we anticipated terminating our agreements and the consideration expected to be received upon termination of our service agreements with those practices 
in the fourth quarter of  we recognized a net gain on separation of approximately million relating to service agreement terminations 
included in this net gain is approximately million arising from final settlements with several practices with which we terminated our relationships where the ultimate settlements were more beneficial to us than we estimated during and resulted in our recognizing in the fourth quarter of the forgiveness of million in notes payable by us to physicians  the waiver by the physicians of their rights to receive million of our common stock previously recognized by us as an obligation when we affiliated with the physicians  and additional consideration received by us in connection with the terminations of million in excess of the carrying value of the net assets of the terminated practices  less a charge of million recognized during the fourth quarter of for the difference between the carrying value of certain assets and the amount we expect to realize upon those assets  as determined in the fourth quarter of restructuring charges in the fourth quarter of  we comprehensively analyzed our operations and cost structure  with a view to repositioning ourselves to effectively execute our strategic and operational initiatives 
this analysis focused on our non core assets and activities we had determined were not consistent with our strategic direction 
as a result of this analysis  during the fourth quarter of  we recorded restructuring charges of million comprising i million related to abandonment of information systems initiatives  including clinical information systems and e commerce initiatives  ii million impairment of a home health business  iii million related to contractual severance of an executive position and iv million related to abandonment of leased and owned facilities for remaining lease obligations and the difference in the net book value of the owned real estate and its expected fair value 
details of the restructuring charge activity relating to that charge in are as follows restructuring asset accrual at accrual at expense in payments write downs december  payments december  abandonment of it systems   impairment of home health business   severance of employment agreement site closures    total     during the first quarter of  we announced plans to further reduce overhead costs and recognized additional pre tax restructuring charges of million  consisting of i a million charge relating to the elimination of approximately personnel positions  ii a million charge for remaining lease obligations and related improvements at sites we decided to close and iii a million charge relating to abandoned software applications 
details of the restructuring charge activity relating to that charge in are as follows restructuring asset accrual at expenses payments write downs december  costs related to personnel reductions   closure of facilities    abandonment of software applications total    other charges during and  we recorded other charges  net  as follows in thousands cashless stock option exercise costs  investigation and contract separation costs  practice accounts receivable and fixed asset write off   credit facility and note amendment fees  management recruiting and relocation costs  vacation pay accrual change in policy  other  in the fourth quarter of  we recognized unusual charges including i million of practice accounts receivable and fixed asset write off  ii a million charge related to our estimated exposure to losses under an insurance policy where the insurer has become insolvent see note  and iii million of consulting costs incurred in connection with development of our service line structure 
the negative impact of these charges was wholly offset by the net gain on separation of million we recognized during the fourth quarter of  which is discussed above in impairment charges 
in the fourth quarter of  we recognized a pre tax million non cash charge related to the cashless exercise of million stock options by our chairman and chief executive officer the optionee  due to the termination of the stock option plan under which the options were granted  in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
to consummate the exercise  the optionee surrendered approximately million shares having an average strike price of to satisfy exercise price and tax liability with respect to all options 
as a result of this transaction  the optionee received approximately million shares of common stock 
we also realized an offsetting million reduction in our federal income tax obligation as a result of this transaction 
during the third quarter and second quarter of  we incurred costs of million and million  respectively  in connection with the qui tam lawsuits described in part i  item  of this report  consisting primarily of auditing and legal fees and related expenses 
in addition  we incurred million of costs in the second quarter of consisting of intangible asset and receivable write downs as a result of terminating our affiliation with a sole practitioner and with the practice named in the qui tam lawsuits 
we also recognized other charges totaling approximately million in these charges consisted of i million of receivables from affiliated practices that are not considered to be recoverable  ii million for bank and noteholder fees associated with amending the credit facilities to accommodate debt covenant compliance related to unusual charges  iii million related to expenses to recruit and relocate certain members of the current management team  and iv million for a change in our vacation policy 
we have recognized a deferred income tax benefit for substantially all of these charges in as many of the items will be deductible for income tax purposes in future periods  and we believe  after considering all historical and expected future events  that sufficient income will be earned in the future to realize these benefits 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased from million in to million in  a decrease of million  or 
the decrease is primarily due to the million impairment of long lived assets and service agreement assets recognized in the fourth quarter of interest 
net interest expense decreased from million in to million in  a decrease of million or  due to a decline in interest rates throughout on our variable rate indebtedness and a lower level of borrowings as a result of payments made from improved cash flows from more efficient business office operations 
other income 
other income of million in represents the gain on shares of common stock of ilex oncology  inc sold during the first quarter of income taxes 
in  we recognized tax expense of million resulting in an effective tax rate of  as compared to in the increase in the effective rate was due to the benefit recognized in as a result of the impairment  restructuring and other charges and no state tax benefit being recognized in for intangible write offs in certain states 
net income loss 
net income loss increased from a net loss of million in to million in net income in  an increase of million 
excluding charges for impairments  restructurings and other costs  costs related to bad debt expense and the gain on investment in common stock for both years  net income for would have been million or per share  as compared to million or per share in  an increase of million 
the charges were attributable to the factors described in the preceding paragraph 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had net working capital of million  including cash and cash equivalents of million 
we had current liabilities of million  including million in current maturities of long term debt  and million of long term indebtedness 
during  we generated million in net operating cash flow  invested million  and used cash from financing activities in the amount of million 
as of march   we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
cash flows from operating activities during  we generated million in cash flows from operating activities as compared to million in the decrease in cash flow is attributable to i advance purchases of certain pharmaceutical products during in order to obtain favorable pricing and qualify for certain rebates  ii a smaller reduction in the number of accounts receivable days outstanding in as compared to the reduction in  and iii timing of certain working capital payments 
our accounts receivable days outstanding as of december   decreased to days from days as of december  and from days as of december  cash flows from investing activities during and  we expended million and million in capital expenditures 
during and  we expended million and million  respectively  on the development and construction of cancer centers 
in addition  we expended million and million on installation of pet centers  respectively  during and  respectively  was financed through various equipment operating leases 
expected capital expenditures on cancer center and pet development are below forecasted amounts due to our focus on transitional activity 
maintenance capital expenditures were million and million in and  respectively 
for all of  we anticipate expending a total of approximately million on maintenance capital expenditures and approximately million on development of new cancer centers and pet installations 
in addition to these capital expenditures  we have financed  and will in the future finance  most of our pet center investments and a portion of our cancer center investments through operating leases 
cash flows from financing activities during  we used cash from financing activities of million as compared to cash used of in such increase in cash flow is primarily attributed to the proceeds from the issuance of our senior subordinated notes due  net of the cash payments for the retirement of our previously existing indebtedness  including a prepayment premium paid as a result of early extinguishment of our senior secured notes due in addition  we expended million to repurchase million shares of our common stock during additionally  we received million shares of our common stock in exchange for certain technical assets in the second quarter of we currently expect that our principal use of funds in the near future will be in connection with the purchase of medical equipment  investment in information systems and the acquisition or lease of real estate for the development of integrated cancer centers and pet centers  as well as implementation of the service line structure  with less emphasis than in past years on transactions with medical oncology practices 
in addition  we anticipate that from time to time we will make significant purchases of pharmaceuticals in excess of normal patterns to take advantage of available volume discounts and rebates 
such purchases  including several planned for the first quarter of will require significant cash outlays and will cause us to maintain higher amounts of inventory  with lower cash balances or higher borrowings for some period of time 
although we expect to fund our capital needs during with our available cash and cash generated from operations  in the future  we may have to incur additional debt or issue additional debt or equity securities from time to time 
capital available for health care companies  whether raised through the issuance of debt or equity securities  is quite limited 
as a result  we may be unable to obtain sufficient financing on terms satisfactory to management or at all 
historically  we satisfied our development and transaction needs through various debt and equity financings and through borrowings under a million syndicated revolving credit facility and a million synthetic leasing facility 
on february   we entered into a five year million syndicated revolving credit facility and terminated our existing syndicated revolving credit facility 
proceeds under that credit facility may be used to finance the development of cancer centers and new pet facilities  to provide working capital or for other general business purposes 
no amounts have been borrowed under that facility 
our credit facility bears interest at a variable rate that floats with a referenced interest rate 
therefore  to the extent we have amounts outstanding under the credit facility in the future  we would be exposed to interest rate risk under our credit facility 
on february   we issued million in senior subordinated notes due to various institutional investors in a private offering under rule a under the securities act of the notes were subsequently exchanged for substantially identical notes in an offering registered under the securities act of the notes are unsecured  bear interest at annually and mature in february payments under those notes are subordinated in substantially all respects to payments under our new credit facility and certain other debt 
we used the proceeds from the senior subordinated notes to repay in full our existing million in senior secured notes due  including a prepayment penalty of million due as a result of our repayment of the notes before their scheduled maturity 
we also used proceeds from the senior subordinated notes to pay fees and related expenses of million associated with issuing those notes and to pay fees and related expenses of million in connection with the new credit facility 
during the first quarter of  we recognized the prepayment penalty of million and a write off of unamortized deferred financing costs related to the terminated debt agreements of million  which were recorded as an extraordinary item during the first quarter of our introduction of the service line structure and transition away from the net revenue model and the related realignment of our business required an amendment or refinancing of our existing facilities 
the new credit facility and senior subordinated notes give us flexibility in this regard 
in addition  we believe that the longer maturity of the senior subordinated notes adds stability to our capital structure 
we entered into a synthetic leasing facility in december  under which a special purpose entity acquired properties and paid for construction of certain of our cancer centers and leased them to us 
it matures in june as of december   we had million outstanding under the facility and no further amounts are available under that facility 
the annual cost of the lease is approximately million  based on interest rates in effect as of december effective december   we amended our synthetic lease so that we now guarantee of the residual value of the properties in the lease 
we had previously guaranteed 
as a result  we now include million outstanding under the lease as indebtedness on our financial statements 
we also included assets under the lease as assets on our balance sheet based upon our determination of fair values of those properties at december  and recognized an impairment charge of million at december  related to these cancer centers 
prior to december   the lease was appropriately recorded as an operating lease and  accordingly neither the debt nor the assets appeared on our financial statements 
this change will not impact our periodic interest payments under the lease 
however  we will begin to recognize a depreciation charge in respect for the assets  currently estimated at million annually  starting in we did not recognize depreciation expense for those off balance sheet assets prior to december  we agreed to increase our guaranty in connection with the lease modification because the lease amendment gives us additional flexibility to sell  move or transfer the assets in the lease 
we believe such flexibility will aid us in implementing our ongoing strategic plans 
for example  we sold two properties under the lease effective in january in connection with practice disaffiliations  and anticipate selling or redeploying other leased properties during in connection with our repositioning 
we also believe the inclusion of the synthetic lease assets and liabilities gives investors a more easily understandable picture of our financial condition 
the lease is renewable in one year increments with the consent of the financial institutions that are parties thereto 
if the lease is not renewed at maturity or otherwise terminates  we must either purchase the properties under the lease for the total amount outstanding or market the properties to third parties 
defaults under the lease  which include cross defaults to other material debt  could result in such a termination  and require us to purchase or remarket the properties 
if we sell the properties to third parties  we have guaranteed a residual value of of the total amount outstanding for the properties 
the guarantees are secured by substantially all of our assets 
the amount outstanding under the synthetic lease appears as long term indebtedness on our balance sheet 
because the synthetic lease payment floats with a referenced interest rate  we are also exposed to interest rate risk under the synthetic lease 
a increase in the referenced rate would result in an increase in lease payments of million annually 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility and advances under the synthetic leasing facility bear interest at a rate equal to a rate based on prime rate or the london interbank offered rate  based on a defined formula 
the credit facility  synthetic leasing facility and senior subordinated notes contain affirmative and negative covenants  including the maintenance of certain financial ratios  restrictions on sales  leases or other dispositions of property  restrictions on other indebtedness and prohibitions on the payment of dividends 
events of default under our credit facility  synthetic leasing facility and senior subordinated notes include cross defaults to all material indebtedness  including each of those financings 
substantially all of our assets  including certain real property  are pledged as security under the credit facility and the guarantee obligations of our synthetic leasing facility 
we are currently in compliance with covenants under our synthetic leasing facility  revolving credit facility and senior subordinated notes  with no borrowings currently outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
we have relied primarily on cash flows from our operations to fund working capital and capital expenditures for our fixed assets 
the following summarizes our contractual obligations in respect of our indebtedness and noncancelable leases at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods based on interest rates in effect as of december  after obligation principal maturities of long term indebtedness  including capital lease obligations million million million million million million non cancelable operating leases million million million million million million in addition  we are obligated to pay million under pending construction contracts  which we would expect to pay during  depending on the progress of construction projects 
for a further discussion of our commitments and contingencies  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative discussion about market risks in the normal course of business  our financial position is routinely subjected to a variety of risks 
we regularly assess these risks and have established policies and business practices to protect against the adverse effects of these and other potential exposures 
among these risks is the market risk associated with interest rate movements on outstanding debt 
our borrowings under the credit facility and leasing facility contain an element of market risk from changes in interest rates 
we currently have no outstanding borrowings under our credit facility 
historically  we have managed this risk  in part  through the use of interest rate swaps  however  no such agreements have been entered into in we do not enter into interest rate swaps or hold other derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
we were not obligated under any interest rate swap agreements during for purposes of specific risk analysis  we use sensitivity analysis to determine the impact that market risk exposures may have on us 
the financial instruments included in the sensitivity analysis consist of all of our cash and equivalents  long term and short term debt and all derivative financial instruments 
to perform sensitivity analysis  we assess the risk of loss in fair values from the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates on market sensitive instruments 
the market values for interest rate risk are computed based on the present value of future cash flows as impacted by the changes in the rates attributable to the market risk being measured 
the discount rates used for the present value computations were selected based on market interest rates in effect at december  the market values that result from these computations are compared with the market values of these financial instruments at december  the differences in this comparison are the hypothetical gains or losses associated with each type of risk 
a one percent increase or decrease in the levels of interest rates on variable rate debt with all other variables held constant would not result in a material change to our results of operations or financial position or the fair value of our financial instruments 
summary of operations by quarter the following table represents unaudited quarterly results for and we believe that all necessary adjustments have been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly the quarterly results when read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and that all adjustments are of a normal recurring nature 
results of operations for any particular quarter are not necessarily indicative of operations for a full year or predictive of future periods
