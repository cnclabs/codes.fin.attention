item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the manufactured housing industry continues to be affected by several challenges including limited retail and wholesale financing availability  increased levels of repossessions  excessive retail inventory levels and manufacturing capacity 
the tightening of credit standards  which began in mid  has resulted in reduced retail sales levels  declining wholesale shipments and declining margins for most industry participants 
industry wide shipments for calendar were down from a year ago and down since the peak in shipments 
in march  conseco finance servicing corp 
conseco  formerly the manufactured housing industry s largest floor plan and consumer lender  announced that they were exiting both the floor plan financing and chattel lending businesses 
also  deutsche financial services deutsche exited the manufactured housing floor plan lending business 
in september  when deutsche announced their intentions to exit the business  palm harbor had a million floor plan facility with deutsche  of which million was outstanding 
the deutsche floor plan facility has been replaced in part by a syndicated floor plan facility led by another financial institution 
with the recent exit of most of the major industry chattel and non conforming mortgage lenders  palm harbor expanded its finance subsidiary  countryplace mortgage  ltd 
countryplace  from being only an originator of loans into a servicer as well 
during fiscal  countryplace originated million of loans to be held for investment on its balance sheet 
these loans were funded through borrowings from its warehouse facility  as well as capital contributions and borrowings from palm harbor 
countryplace is servicing all of the loans held for investment in its portfolio and will originate loans only through company owned retail superstores 
during the first quarter of fiscal  palm harbor entered into an agreement to become the sole limited partner and owner of bsm financial lp bsm  a major dallas mortgage banking firm that has experience and capability in generating conforming and government insured loans in the site built  modular and manufactured housing markets 
in addition  palm harbor purchased nationwide custom homes nationwide  a leading manufacturer and marketer of modular homes 
this acquisition should enable palm harbor to appeal to homebuyers not reached by our manufactured housing distribution or manufactured housing retail financing 
despite these difficult conditions  palm harbor s consolidated operating results were profitable this fiscal year 
additionally  palm harbor profitably increased market share and reduced inventories  while continuing our growth strategy of opening new retail superstores and expanding countryplace 
during fiscal  the number of company owned retail superstores increased by two to countryplace mortgage  palm harbor s finance subsidiary  and standard casualty company  palm harbor s insurance subsidiary  continued to be additive to consolidated sales and net income 
palm harbor had cash and cash equivalents of million at march  in addition  palm harbor s practice of manufacturing only to retail customer order coupled with closely monitored retail receivables and stocking levels has enabled us to tightly manage retail receivables and new home inventory levels 
retail receivables and new home inventory per retail superstore have declined since the beginning of the fiscal year 
the manufactured housing industry is affected by cyclical downturns and seasonal fluctuations that often make difficult period to period comparisons of our revenues and operating results 
the following table sets forth certain items of palm harbor s statement of income as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated 
fiscal year ended march  march  march  net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses income from operations interest expense interest income and other income before income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle income tax expense income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle cumulative effect of change in accounting principle net income the following table summarizes certain key sales statistics as of and for the period indicated 
fiscal year ended march  march  march  company homes sold through company owned retail superstores    total new factory built homes sold    average new home price retail    number of retail superstores at end of period homes sold to independent dealers and builders    compared to net sales 
net sales decreased to million in from million in the decrease in net sales was primarily due to the reduction of retail financing available in the manufactured housing industry partially offset by the addition of modular sales which totaled million in fiscal the volume of manufactured homes sold through company owned retail superstores declined while overall manufactured housing unit volume  which includes sales to independent retailers  declined in fiscal this decline in volume is partially offset by an increase in the average selling price of a new manufactured home to  in from  in this increase in average selling price resulted from a slight shift in product mix towards multi section manufactured homes 
multi section manufactured homes represented of palm harbor s manufactured homes sold in the number of company owned retail superstores increased from at the end of fiscal to at the end of fiscal gross profit 
in fiscal  gross profit as a percentage of net sales declined to from in fiscal gross profit decreased to million in compared to million in this decrease  both as a percentage of sales and in absolute dollars  is principally the result of the contraction of retail financing and the intensely competitive industry environment 
the percentage of manufactured homes sold through company owned retail superstores decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to in from in selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  to million in from million in this reduction reflects palm harbor s focus on reducing fixed costs somewhat offset by its continued commitment to building brand awareness via advertising and expenses associated with the expansion of countryplace and the rollout of palm harbor s new mortgage lending operations 
additionally  selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal include ten months of nationwide s fixed expenses 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased to million in from million in this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the prime interest rate from at the end of fiscal to at the end of fiscal coupled with a decrease in the floor plan liability 
interest income and other 
interest income and other decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease was primarily the result of decreased interest income in fiscal  decreased income earned on a real estate investment in fiscal and a loss on short term investments in fiscal  partially offset by palm harbor s equity interest in the earnings of its limited partnership  bsm  which was million in fiscal and zero in fiscal compared to net sales 
net sales decreased to million in from million in the decrease in net sales was primarily due to competitive conditions in the manufactured housing industry as indicated by a decrease of in the volume of homes sold through company owned retail superstores while overall unit volume  which includes sales to independent retailers  declined in fiscal this decline in volume is partially offset by an increase in the average selling price of a new home  which resulted from a continued shift in product mix towards multi section homes 
of the homes sold by the company  were multi section in fiscal versus in fiscal the number of company owned superstores increased from at the end of fiscal to at the end of fiscal gross profit 
in fiscal  gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased slightly to from in fiscal gross profit decreased to million in compared to million in palm harbor sold of its homes through company owned retail superstores in both fiscal and fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased  as planned  to in from in selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in  primarily due to palm harbor s continued commitment to building brand awareness via advertising  startup expenses associated with the net increase of six retail superstores opened during fiscal as well as those expected to be opened in fiscal and training costs associated with people development 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased to million in from million in this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the prime interest rate from at the end of fiscal to at the end of fiscal coupled with a decrease in the floor plan liability 
liquidity and capital resources cash provided by operating activities totaled million in  compared to million in and million in cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal primarily due to decreases in trade receivables  inventories  and overhead expenditures 
cash provided by operations was adequate to support palm harbor s working capital needs  capital expenditures  floor plan payments  investment purchases  expansion of countryplace and the rollout of new mortgage lending operations during fiscal capital expenditures were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
in  capital expenditures included million for additional retail superstores and approximately million primarily for improvements in mature manufacturing facilities 
in  capital expenditures included million for additional retail superstores and approximately million primarily for improvements in mature manufacturing facilities 
in  capital expenditures included million for additional retail superstores and approximately million primarily for improvements in mature manufacturing facilities 
palm harbor expects capital expenditures to approximate million during primarily for the purpose of improving mature manufacturing facilities and adding retail superstores 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  palm harbor executed a million syndicated floor plan facility with a financial institution 
the advance rate for this facility is of manufacturer s invoice 
on march   million of this facility will expire and the remaining million will expire via orderly liquidations by the end of september palm harbor is exploring several options to replace this portion of the facility 
palm harbor has a second facility with another financial institution for million  which automatically renews each year unless notification of cancellation is received by the financial institution 
these facilities are used to finance a major portion of the home inventory at our retail superstores and are secured by a portion of our home inventory and receivables from financial institutions 
the interest rates on the facilities are prime at march  or prime plus to for aged units  of which we have none 
these two floor plan facilities contain certain provisions regarding minimum financial requirements which we must maintain in order to borrow against the facilities 
as of march   palm harbor was in compliance with our million floor plan facility and had obtained a limited forbearance with respect to a violation of our minimum covenant requirements on our million facility 
palm harbor had  and  outstanding on these floor plan credit facilities at march  and march   respectively 
with the exit of several major industry retail lenders over recent months  palm harbor is expanding countryplace from being an originator of loans into a securitizer and servicer of loans as well 
countryplace has entered into an agreement with a financial institution for a million warehouse facility to fund chattel loans originated by company owned retail superstores 
this facility is collateralized by specific receivables pledged to the facility and bears interest at the rate of libor plus at march  
the facility terminates on march  the facility provides for an advance of against the outstanding principal balance of eligible receivables as further defined in the warehouse agreement 
countryplace had outstanding borrowings under this facility of  as of march  the facility contains certain requirements relating to the performance and composition of the receivables pledged to the facility and certain financial covenants  which are customary in the industry 
the facility also requires palm harbor and countryplace to maintain a minimum balance of shareholders equity 
as of march   both palm harbor and countryplace were in compliance with these requirements 
in connection with the warehouse borrowing facility  palm harbor agreed to fund in cash to countryplace  up to of each loan loss incurred 
as of march  there had been no losses related to any loans in the portfolio and no such loss funding was required 
additionally  palm harbor has entered into an intercompany financing arrangement with countryplace that provides for up to million of funding to be used for the growth of countryplace s portfolio and operations 
as of march   approximately million was advanced to countryplace under this intercompany financing arrangement 
countryplace currently intends to originate and hold loans for investment on a long term basis 
countryplace intends to securitize its loan portfolio on a routine basis 
while the company believes it will be able to obtain additional liquidity through the securitization of such loans  no assurances can be made that the company will successfully complete securitization transactions on acceptable terms and conditions  if at all 
in july  palm harbor s board of directors authorized  subject to certain business and market conditions  the use of up to million to repurchase palm harbor s common stock 
in july  the board of directors authorized another million for common stock repurchases 
as of may   palm harbor had invested million in the common stock buyback program 
palm harbor believes that cash flows from operations  together with floor plan financing and other available borrowing alternatives in addition to the warehouse facility  will be adequate to support our working capital  currently planned capital expenditure needs and expansion of countryplace over the next twelve months 
however  because future cash flows and the availability of financing will depend on a number of factors  including prevailing economic and financial conditions  business  the market for asset backed securitizations  and other factors beyond palm harbor s control  no assurances can be given in this regard 
contractual obligations and commitments dollars in thousands the following tables summarize palm harbor s contractual obligations and contingent commitments at march  for additional information related to these obligations  see the notes to consolidated financial statements 
payments due by period less than after total year years years years floor plan payable   warehouse revolving debt   other debt obligations   operating leases      total contractual cash obligations      amount of commitment expiration per period total amounts less than after committed year years years years repurchase obligations   letters of credit   total commercial commitments   palm harbor has contingent repurchase obligations outstanding at march  which have a finite life but are replaced as palm harbor continues to sell our manufactured homes to dealers under repurchase agreements with financial institutions 
the cost of these contingent repurchase obligations to palm harbor was   and  during fiscal   and  respectively 
for additional information on palm harbor s repurchase obligations  see critical accounting policies reserve for repurchase obligations 
palm harbor has provided letters of credit to providers of certain of our insurance policies 
while the current letters of credit have a finite life  they are subject to renewal at different amounts based on the requirements of the insurance carriers 
palm harbor has recorded insurance expense based on anticipated losses related to these policies as is customary in the manufactured housing industry 
palm harbor has contingent obligations related to installment loan contracts sold with recourse 
see note to the financial statements for a discussion of such recourse contingent obligations 
critical accounting policies palm harbor s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires palm harbor to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
impairment of intangible assets 
in assessing the recoverability of palm harbor s intangibles  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  palm harbor may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
revenue recognition 
retail sales  including shipping charges  are recognized when a down payment is received  the customer enters into a legally binding sales contract  title has transferred and the home is accepted by the customer  delivered and permanently located at the customer s site 
homes sold to independent retailers are recognized when the home is shipped which is when the title passes to the independent retailer 
the transportation cost is borne by the independent retailer 
warranties 
palm harbor provides the retail home buyer a one year limited warranty covering defects in material or workmanship in home structure  plumbing and electrical systems 
we record a liability for estimated future warranty costs relating to homes sold  based upon our assessment of historical experience factors 
factors we use in the estimation of the warranty liability include historical warranty experience related to the actual number of calls and the average cost per call 
although we maintain reserves for such claims based on our assessments as described above  which to date have been adequate  there can be no assurance that warranty expense levels will remain at current levels or that such reserves will continue to be adequate 
a large number of warranty claims exceeding our current warranty expense levels could have a material effect on palm harbor s results of operations 
reserve for repurchase obligations 
manufactured housing companies enter into repurchase agreements with financial institutions which have provided wholesale floor plan financing to independent retailers 
these agreements generally provide that in the event of a retailer s default palm harbor will repurchase the financed home from the lending institution at declining prices over the term of the repurchase agreement generally months 
the risk of loss under such repurchase agreements is mitigated by the fact that i only of palm harbor harbor s homes are sold to independent retailers  ii a majority of the homes sold by palm harbor to independent retailers are pre sold to specific retail customers  iii palm harbor monitors each retailer s inventory position on a regular basis  iv sales of palm harbor s manufactured homes are spread over a large number of retailers  v none of palm harbor s independent retailers accounted for more than of palm harbor s net sales in fiscal  vi the price palm harbor is obligated to pay declines over time and vii palm harbor is  in most cases  able to resell homes repurchased from credit sources in the ordinary course of business without incurring significant losses 
since mid  the manufactured housing industry has been affected by three major challenges retail financing availability  repossessions and retail inventory levels 
the rapid growth in the number of retailers prior to the deterioration of retail financing has resulted in an imbalance between retail inventory levels and consumer demand 
if retail financing was to significantly weaken further  the inventory imbalance could result in even greater price competition  gross margin deterioration and have an overall material adverse effect on palm harbor s operating results 
while palm harbor s practice of manufacturing only to order coupled with closely monitored retail stocking levels has enabled us to continue to tightly manage inventories  we are unable to predict the impact on palm harbor s results if industry conditions were to further deteriorate 
allowance for loan losses 
countryplace originates and holds for investment purposes loans related to the retail sale of manufactured palm harbor homes  with such loans being collateralized primarily by the manufactured home 
palm harbor provides  at the time of sale  allowances for estimated future loan losses 
the allowance for loan gives consideration to the composition of the loan portfolio  including number of delinquencies and historical loss experience  and expectations as to future loan losses based upon industry knowledge 
although palm harbor maintains an allowance for loan losses based upon these expectations and other criteria  future differences between palm harbor s expectations with respect to loan losses and actual losses incurred in the portfolio could differ  and require palm harbor to provide additional allowances 
new accounting pronouncements on july   the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
effective march   palm harbor adopted sfas no 
which requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material effect on palm harbor s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
effective march   palm harbor adopted interpretation no 
which clarifies the requirement for recognition of a liability by a guarantor at the inception of the guarantee  based on the fair value of the non contingent obligation to perform 
interpretation no 
must be applied prospectively to guarantees entered into or modified after december  the adoption of interpretation no 
did not have a material effect on palm harbor s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
under previous practices  certain entities were included in consolidated financial statements based upon controlling voting interests or in other special situations 
under interpretation no 
 certain previously unconsolidated entities will be required to be included in consolidated financial statements of the primary beneficiary  as defined 
for variable interest entities  often referred to as special purpose entities  created after january   interpretation no 
is effective immediately 
palm harbor is currently evaluating the impact of interpretation no 
on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
forward looking information risk factors certain statements contained in this annual report are forward looking statements within the safe harbor provisions of the securities litigation reform act 
forward looking statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events and can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts 
investors should be aware that all forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and  as a result of certain factors  actual results could differ materially from these expressed in or implied by such statements 
these risks include such assumptions  risks  uncertainties and factors associated with the following availability of retail financing 
since mid  loans to purchase manufactured houses have been subjected to elevated credit standards  resulting in reduced lending volumes and consequently reduced sales in the manufactured housing industry 
a further tightening of chattel or mortgage credit standards may cause palm harbor to experience significant sales declines 
availability of wholesale financing 
several floor plan lenders have chosen to exit the manufactured housing business  thereby reducing the amount of credit available to industry retailers 
further reductions in the availability of floor plan lending may adversely affect palm harbor s inventory levels of new homes 
ability to securitize or fund loans 
countryplace originates chattel and non conforming land home mortgage loans that are funded with proceeds from its warehouse borrowing facility borrowings from palm harbor 
countryplace intends to enter into asset backed securitization transactions to obtain longer term funding for these loan purchases 
the proceeds from these securitizations will be used to repay borrowings from the warehouse facility and palm harbor  as well as to purchase new loans 
the asset backed securitization market for manufactured housing lenders has continued to deteriorate in the past year in terms of access to the markets as well as pricing and credit enhancement levels 
if countryplace is unable to securitize its loans on terms that are economical  it will be required to seek other sources of long term funding 
ability to service new loans 
although countryplace has originated loans since  it has limited loan servicing and collections experience 
countryplace has implemented new systems to service and collect the portfolio of loans it originates 
the management of countryplace has industry experience in managing  servicing and collecting a loan portfolio 
however  if countryplace is not successful in its servicing and collection efforts  the profitability and cash flow from the loan portfolio on its balance sheet could be adversely affected 
ability of customers to repay loans 
countryplace makes loans to borrowers that it believes are creditworthy based on its credit guidelines 
these customers may experience adverse employment  financial  or life circumstances that affect their ability to repay their loans 
if customers do not repay their loans  the profitability and cash flow from the loan portfolio on its balance sheet could be adversely affected 
management s ability to attract and retain executive officers and other key personnel 
palm harbor is dependent on the services and performance of our executive officers  including our chairman of the board  lee posey and our president and chief executive officer  larry keener 
the loss of the services of two or more of our executive officers could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
control by existing shareholders 
approximately of the outstanding common stock of palm harbor is beneficially owned or controlled by mr 
posey  capital southwest corporation and its wholly owned subsidiary  capital southwest venture corporation and william r 
thomas  president of capital southwest corporation 
as a result  these shareholders  acting together  will be able to determine the outcome of elections of palm harbor s directors and thereby control the management of palm harbor s business 
impact of inflation 
the past several years have shown a relatively moderate rate of inflation which palm harbor has been able to offset through increased selling prices 
a material increase in inflation in the future could adversely affect palm harbor s operating results 
competitive product advertising  promotional and pricing activity 
there are numerous manufactured housing companies in the industry and many have their own retail distribution systems and consumer finance operations 
in addition to competition within the manufactured housing industry  our products also compete with other forms of lower to moderate cost housing  including site built homes  apartments  townhouses and condominiums 
if we are unable to address this competition  growth in each segment of our business could be limited 
cyclicality of the manufactured housing industry 
the cyclical and seasonal nature of the industry causes our revenues and operating results to fluctuate and makes it hard for management to forecast sales and profits in uncertain times 
as a result of seasonal and cyclical downturns  we may experience fluctuations in our operating results that make difficult period to period comparisons 
volatility in our stock price 
our stock is traded on the nasdaq national stock market and is therefore subject to market fluctuations 
during fiscal  our stock price ranged from a low of per share to a high of per share 
terrorist attacks war 
market disruptions and other effects resulting from the terrorist attacks on september  and actions  including armed conflict by the united states and other governments in reaction thereto may materially adversely affect us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk palm harbor is exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on our variable rate debt  which consists primarily of our liabilities under retail floor plan financing arrangements and warehouse revolving debt  and our fixed rate loans receivable balances 
palm harbor is not involved in any other market risk sensitive contracts or investments such as interest rate swaps  futures contracts  or other types of derivative financial instruments 
for variable interest rate obligations  changes in interest rates generally do not impact fair market value  but do affect future earnings and cash flows 
assuming palm harbor and countryplace s level of variable rate debt as of march  is held constant  each one percentage point increase in interest rates occurring on the first day of the year would result in an increase in interest expense for the coming year of approximately million 
for fixed rate loans receivable  changes in interest rates generally do not change future earnings and cash flows  but do affect the fair market value of the loan portfolio 
assuming countryplace s level of loans held for investment as of march  is held constant  a increase in average interest rates would decrease the fair value of the company s portfolio by approximately million 
countryplace is exposed to market risk related to the accessibility and terms of financing in the asset backed securities market 
countryplace intends to securitize its loan portfolio as a means to obtain long term fixed interest rate funding 
the asset backed securities market for manufactured housing has been volatile during the past year 
the inability to securitize its loans would require countryplace to seek other sources of funding or to reduce or eliminate its loan originations if other sources of funding are not available
