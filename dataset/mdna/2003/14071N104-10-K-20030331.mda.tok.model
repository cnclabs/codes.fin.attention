on march   the company announced a new business strategy based on the mobile business solutions market 
the launching of this new strategy resulted in an increase in operating expenses in over 
table of contents levels historically experienced by the company 
in  it became apparent that the mobile business solutions market was not developing at the pace originally anticipated 
accordingly  the company reduced its spending in this area 
the company intends to invest cautiously in this area until such time as management believes market adoption for such products is likely to increase to the level necessary for the company to experience a profitable contribution 
critical accounting policies the discussion in this form k  are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingencies 
the securities and exchange commission has defined a company s most critical accounting policies as the policies that are the most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate the estimates used  including those related to impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets  useful lives of intangible assets  inventory valuation allowances  revenue recognition  the estimated allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts  and restructuring related liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current conditions  and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources as well as identifying and assessing our accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions  judgments or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we also follow other key accounting policies  which involve the use of estimates  judgments  and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results 
for additional information see note to the company s consolidated financial statements included in this report 
our most critical accounting policies relate to the following areas revenue recognition  allowances for returns  warranty obligations and doubtful accounts  valuation of inventory at lower of cost or market value  valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill  and contingencies 
revenue recognition 
our revenue recognition policies follow the guidelines of the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended 
these guidelines require that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the selling price is fixed or determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
revenue from product sales to resellers are generally recognized when related products are shipped  provided fees are fixed and determinable and collection is deemed probable 
in instances where the company has an installation obligation  revenue is recognized when product installation is complete 
costs related to insignificant customer support obligations  which include telephone support  are accrued at the time the related revenue is recorded  as are estimated returns 
revenue from software maintenance agreements are recognized over the contract periods  generally one year  on a straight line basis 
revenues from document delivery services are recognized when services are provided 
revenue related to the company s oem agreement with cisco systems is generally recorded as cash payments are received 
however  if payments are received ahead of schedule  a portion would be deferred to future support periods 

table of contents allowances for returns  warranty obligations and doubtful accounts 
management must make estimates of potential future product returns and related warranty obligations related to current period revenue 
management analyzes historical returns and warranty claims  current economic trends  changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns and other allowances in any accounting period 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is a management estimate that considers facts and circumstances of individual customers  distributors  partners  and other debtors  such as financial condition and historical payment trends 
we evaluate the adequacy of the allowance utilizing a combination of specific identification of potentially problematic accounts and identification of accounts that have exceeded payment terms 
valuation of inventory at lower of cost or market value 
due to rapid changes in technology  it is possible that older products in inventory may become obsolete or the company may sell these products below cost 
when the company determines that the carrying value of inventories is not recoverable  inventories are written down to market value 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  inventory write downs may be required 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
management periodically evaluates the recoverability of its long lived assets following the guidance of statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
when doing so  management is required to estimate undiscounted cash flows to assess the recoverability of those assets 
there is a risk that actual cash flow will be less than projected cash flow  particularly related to its mobile delivery products  which compete in an emerging market 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the asset that may not be reflected in an asset s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units  assigning goodwill to reporting units  and determining the fair value of each reporting unit 
significant judgments required to estimate the fair value of reporting units include estimating future cash flows  determining appropriate discount rates and other assumptions 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit 
contingencies 
the company is periodically involved in litigation or claims  including patent infringements claims  in the normal course of its business 
management follows the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies to record litigation or claim related expenses 
we evaluate  among other factors  the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss 
the company accrues for settlements when the outcome is probable and the amount or range of the settlement can be reasonably estimated 
in addition to management s judgments and use of estimates  there are inherent uncertainties surrounding litigation and claims  which could result in actual settlement amounts that differ materially from estimates 
legal costs are expensed as incurred 

table of contents consolidated results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of net sales represented by certain items in the company s consolidated statements of income

table of contents net sales and gross margin of total net sales change from of total net sales change from of total net sales in thousands net sales e document products other software products total software products e document services total net sales gross margin software products e document services total gross margin the company derives net sales primarily from initial sales of software and licenses  e document delivery services as well as follow on sales of add on software modules and product upgrades 
sales to resellers  distributors and end users are recognized when the products are shipped unless the sale includes acceptance provisions 
sales of fully integrated systems are no longer significant 
the company continues to distribute both fax and voice circuit boards with a significant number of its software product sales for which the company receives a margin significantly less than the margin on its software products 
the sales mix among the company s product categories and the circuit board content of its product sales affect both net sales and gross margin 
additionally  the company receives maintenance fees for providing technical support and or product upgrades 
the company recognizes maintenance revenue ratably over the life of the maintenance contract 
net sales years ended december  and the increase in e document product sales  which is comprised of the rightfax product line  was driven by an increase in maintenance revenue as the company continued to expand its installed base of customers partially offset by a decrease in sales of software and distributed circuit boards 
other software products include sales of messaging and mobility products  as well as revenue from the company s oem agreement with cisco systems  which became effective in exclusive of the million of revenue from the cisco agreement  the remainder of other software products declined in when compared to the company believes the continued low levels of telephony equipment spending and generally overall tight economic conditions contributed to this decline 
net sales of mobile delivery products were not significant in either or and the company does not anticipate a substantive increase in the company believes that growth in net sales of the company s messaging products depends on the level of sales in the telephone switch marketplace 
rightfax product revenues continue to approximate recent historical levels and the company expects such trends to continue in the company believes that overall economic conditions and other worldwide factors will continue to impact the company in revenue from the cisco agreement is currently anticipated to be approximately million in however  such anticipated revenue depends on the receipt of future payments from cisco 
the timing and 
table of contents amount of these payments are subject to a number of conditions  some of which are beyond the control of the company and there can be no assurance that any additional payments will be made 
in particular  future payments depend on cisco s ability to successfully implement the technology 
in addition  under certain conditions cisco may accelerate the payments at a discounted rate or terminate the license and make no further payments 
the services segment increase is reflective of the company s ability to increase volume combined with relatively stable pricing in the outsourced broadcast fax industry in there can be no assurances that recent relatively stable pricing trends will continue 
years ended december  and the increase in over in e document products was driven by increases in maintenance revenue 
the company believes that the tightening of information technology spending and softness in the telephone equipment marketplace that began in  but intensified in the company s markets in  were the primary contributors to this decline in sales 
the company believes the decline from over in the company s service segment reflects industry wide pricing pressure that was experienced in the outsourced broadcast fax market during this time period 
international sales were  and of total net sales for   and  respectively 
the decrease in was primarily driven by decreases in sales in the united kingdom  which the company believes were reflective of the economic conditions in that region 
gross profit years ended december  and in  gross profit increased from million to million  however  gross profit was negatively impacted by write downs of inventory that resulted from excess inventory brought on by earlier than expected adoption of newer voice and fax board versions 
the company currently expects gross margin  as a percentage  to continue in the low to mid sixties  which is in line with current trends 
realization of revenue from the cisco oem agreement has a material impact on the company s margin percentage as this revenue carries a significantly higher margin than normal product sales 
years ended december  and the decrease in gross profit reflects the effects of the fixed portion of technical support and production costs on lower sales volumes and the impact of technology changes on our inventory 
research and development change from change from in thousands research and development years ended december  and the decrease in research and development expenses in over is reflective of the company s efforts to control costs and reduce investment in its mobile business solutions offerings and the reversal of a  related to the settlement of a prior year accrual associated with an earn out provision from the infinite technologies acquisition 
in it became apparent that the mobile business solutions market was not developing at the pace originally anticipated 
accordingly  the company reduced its spending in this area 
the company intends to invest cautiously in this area until such time as management believes market adoption for such products is likely to increase to the level necessary for the company to experience a profitable contribution 
years ended december  and the increase in research and development expenses in over reflects the company s investment in new product offerings  including infinite mobile delivery and new versions of callxpress and rightfax 

table of contents selling  general and administrative change from change from in thousands selling  general and administrative years ended december  and significant additional selling  general and administrative costs were incurred in as a result of the launch of the company s mobility initiative  significant corporate branding efforts and additional headcount resulting from the acquisition of infinite technologies

the related amortization is not expected to be material to the company s future results of operations 
stock based compensation during the second quarter of  the company offered a limited non compulsory exchange of employee stock options on a less than one for one basis 
the exchange which closed on july  resulted in the voluntary cancellation of employee stock options to purchase  shares of our common stock with varying exercise prices greater than per share in exchange for  employee stock options with an exercise price of
