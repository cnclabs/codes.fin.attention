item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for an understanding of the significant factors that influenced our performance during the past three years  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the other information appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a leading company in the design  development  manufacture and marketing of high power  high performance power semiconductors 
our power semiconductors improve system efficiency and reliability by converting electricity at relatively high voltage and current levels into the finely regulated power required by electronic products 
we focus on the market for power semiconductors that are capable of processing greater than watts of power 
the semiconductor industry is cyclical and has from time to time experienced depressed business conditions 
the semiconductor industry has historically experienced a decrease in average selling prices of products over time 
the power semiconductor industry is currently experiencing a slowdown in demand and worldwide overcapacity  resulting in price erosion 
additionally  a number of factors can result in quarter to quarter fluctuations in operating results  including the reduction  rescheduling or cancellation of orders by customers  fluctuations in the timing and amount of customer requests for product shipments  fluctuations in the manufacturing yields and significant yield losses  and availability of production capacity 
in fiscal year  north american sales represented approximately  and international sales represented approximately  of our net revenues 
of our international sales  approximately were derived from sales in europe and the middle east and approximately were derived from sales in asia 
no single end customer accounted for more than of our net revenues in fiscal year we do not hedge 
table of contents our foreign currency transactions 
accordingly  although many of our sales and expenses occur in the same currency  translation of foreign currencies into us dollars may negatively impact us 
critical accounting policies our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies 
our critical accounting policies are as follows allowance for sales returns 
we maintain allowances for sales returns for estimated product returns by our customers 
we estimate our allowance for sales returns based on our historical return experience  current economic trends  changes in customer demand  known returns we have not received and other assumptions 
if we make different judgments or utilize different estimates  the amount and timing of our revenue could be materially different 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we evaluate our allowance for doubtful accounts based on the aging of our accounts receivable  the financial condition of our customers and their payment history  our historical write off experience and other assumptions 
if we were to make different judgments of the financial condition of our customers or the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventories 
inventories are recorded at the lower of standard cost  which approximates actual cost on a first in first out basis  or market value 
our policy for valuation of inventory  including the determination of excess inventory  requires us to estimate the future demand for our products within specific time horizons  generally twelve to twenty four months or less 
we typically plan our production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand  which is difficult to predict and can fluctuate substantially 
the estimates of future demand that we use in the valuation of inventory are the basis for our published revenue forecast  which is also consistent with our short term manufacturing plan 
if our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly  we could be required to record additional inventory write downs  which would have a negative impact on our gross margin 
our inventories include high technology parts and components that are specialized in nature or subject to technological obsolescence 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a write down for obsolete inventory 
our write down for obsolete inventories includes on hand finished goods inventory with a date of manufacture of greater than three years old 
actual demand and market conditions may be different from those projected by our management 
this could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position 
if we make different judgments or utilize different estimates  the amount and timing of our inventory write downs may be materially different 
warranty accrual 
our products are generally subject to warranty and we provide for the estimated future costs of repair  replacement or customer accommodation upon shipment of the product in the accompanying statements of operations 
our warranty accrual is estimated based on historical claims compared to historical revenues and assumes that we have to replace products subject to a claim 
for new products  we use our historical percentage for the appropriate class of product 
should actual product failure rates differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
valuation of plant  equipment  and intangible assets 
we evaluate the recoverability of our plant and equipment and intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the standard retains the previously existing accounting requirements related to the recognition and measurement of the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used while expanding the measurement requirements of long lived assets to be disposed of by sale to include discontinued operations 
it also expands on the previously existing reporting requirements for discontinued operations to include a component of an entity that either has been disposed of 
table of contents or is classified as held for sale 
actual useful lives and cash flows could be different from those estimated by our management 
this could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from product sales upon shipment provided that we have received an executed purchase order  the price is fixed  title has transferred  collection of resulting receivables is reasonably assured  there are no customer acceptance requirements  and there are no remaining significant obligations 
reserves for sales returns and allowances are recorded at the time of shipment 
specifically  our management must make estimates of potential future product returns and allowance for so called ship and debit transactions related to current period product revenue 
our management analyzes historical returns discounts and ship and debit transactions  current economic trends and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns and other allowances 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the sales returns and other allowances in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
in addition  in connection with the acquisition of clare  we adopted a critical accounting policy for nonrecurring engineering  or nre  work 
nre work relates to engineering work performed by our clare micronix division  to design chip prototypes that will later be used to produce required units 
customers enter into arrangements with clare micronix to perform engineering work for a fixed fee 
clare micronix records fixed fee payments during the development phase from customers in accordance with emerging issues task force  or eitf  abstracts  accounting for pre production costs related to long term supply arrangements 
clare micronix records research and development costs as expenses are incurred 
clare micronix then credits research and development expenses for payments made by the customer 
up front payments made by the customer are initially recorded as customer deposits and are charged to the statement of income as expenses for the project as costs are incurred 
goodwill 
we regularly evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate a possible impairment of goodwill 
in determining whether there is an impairment of goodwill  we calculate the estimated fair value of our company based on the closing sales price of our common stock and projected discounted cash flows as of the date we perform the impairment tests 
we allocate a portion of the total fair value to different reporting units based on discounted cash flows 
we then compare the resulting fair values of reporting units to their respective net book values  including goodwill 
if the net book value of our company exceeds its fair value  we measure the amount of the impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of our goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
to the extent that the carrying amount of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  we recognized a goodwill impairment loss 
we perform this impairment test annually and whenever facts and circumstances indicate that there is a possible impairment of goodwill 
we have completed the required annual impairment test  which resulted in no impairment for fiscal year we believe the methodology we use in testing impairment of goodwill provides us with reasonable basis in determining whether an impairment charge should be taken 
pension obligation 
the determination of our obligation and expense for pension and other postretirement benefits is dependent on our selection of certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
those assumptions are described in note to the consolidated financial statements and include  among others  the discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets and rates of increase in compensation 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect our recognized expenses and recorded obligations in such future periods 
while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and our future expenses 
legal contingencies 
we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims  the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty 
sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred 
we evaluate  
table of contents among other factors  the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss 
changes in these factors could materially impact our financial position or our results of operations 
income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as pensions or capital leases  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in differed tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
results of operations net revenues 
net revenues for fiscal year were million  a increase from net revenues of million in fiscal year international net revenues were million for fiscal year  or of net revenues  as compared to million for fiscal year  or of net revenues 
the increase in net revenues for fiscal year from fiscal year is primarily related to the inclusion of revenues from acquired entities and includes an approximate increase in units shipped in fiscal year in our traditional product line as compared to fiscal year and an approximate increase in average selling prices across our traditional product line which does not include products from our acquired entities  clare and westcode 
net revenues for fiscal year were million  a decrease from net revenues of million in fiscal year international net revenues were million for fiscal year  or of net revenues  as compared to million for fiscal year  or of net revenues 
the decrease in net revenues for fiscal year from fiscal year is primarily related to an approximately decrease in units shipped in fiscal year in our traditional product line as compared to fiscal year and an approximately decrease in average selling prices across our traditional product line 
we believe that the decrease in unit sales volume in was largely attributable to decreased demand for power conversion systems for communications infrastructure applications 
gross profit 
gross profit was million  or of net revenues in fiscal year  as compared to million  or of net revenues  in fiscal year the decrease in margins was primarily due to a million write down of excess inventories  an increase in unabsorbed manufacturing overhead from acquired entities  and offset by an approximate increase in average selling prices across our traditional product line 
our excess inventory write off in of million reflects our assessment of the marketplace for our traditional products sold in the us work in process and finished goods inventory are determined to be excess based on a demand forecast within a specific time horizon  generally to months or less 
inventory in excess of saleable amounts is written down and carried at no value  and the remaining inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market 
gross profit was million  or of net revenues in fiscal year  as compared to million  or of net revenues  in fiscal year the decrease in margins was primarily due to a decrease in average selling price as well as a change in the mix of product sold 
research  development and engineering 
during fiscal year  research  development and engineering  or r d  expense was million  or of net revenues  as compared to million  or of net revenues  in fiscal year the dollar and percentage increases were due to the addition of the clare and westcode engineering teams 
during fiscal year  r d expense was million  or of net revenues  as compared to million  or of net revenues  in fiscal year the dollar decrease was due to a 
table of contents fewer number of research and development projects 
as a percentage of revenues  r d expense increased as a result of such expenses decreasing at a relatively slower rate than revenues 
selling  general and administrative 
during fiscal year  selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expense was million  or of net revenues  as compared to million  or of net revenues  in fiscal year the percentage and dollar amount increase is caused mainly by the acquisition of clare and westcode 
during fiscal year  sg a expense was million  or of net revenues  as compared to million  or of net revenues  in fiscal year the dollar amount decrease reflects a decrease in expenses to support a lower revenue level 
as a percentage of revenues  sg a expense increased as a result of such expenses decreasing at a relatively slower rate than revenues 
restructuring 
in june  we adopted a corporate restructuring program to reduce expenses and preserve our cash 
the restructuring mainly relates to a reduction in the workforce designed to eliminate redundant positions at clare 
the restructuring charge  which consists mainly of involuntary employee separation costs of  was recorded in operating expense for the year ended march  the separation cost is for employees worldwide in sales and marketing  in research and development  in general and administrative and in operations functions in the united states  and in sales and marketing and in general and administrative outside the united states 
interest income expense  net 
during fiscal year  interest income expense  net  was million  as compared to interest income expense  net  of million in fiscal year the decrease is mainly due to reduced interest rates on invested balances 
during fiscal year  interest income expense  net  was million  as compared to million in fiscal year the increase is mainly due to interest received from the investment of the net proceeds from our secondary public offering during the whole fiscal year other income expense  net 
other income expense  net  including gain loss on foreign currency transactions  in fiscal year was million  as compared to million in fiscal year the increase in other expenses was primarily due to the fluctuation in the euros and uk pound sterling against the us dollar 
other income expense  net  including gain on foreign currency transactions  in fiscal year was million as compared to  in fiscal year the increase in other expense was mainly due to litigation defense costs of million 
benefit from provision for income taxes 
in fiscal year  the benefit from income taxes reflects an effective tax rate of  as compared to a provision for in fiscal the lower tax benefit rate for was primarily related to income tax allowances related to losses incurred in certain foreign jurisdictions 
the fiscal year provision for income taxes reflects an effective tax rate of in fiscal year  which remained unchanged from fiscal liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents 
as of march   cash and cash equivalents were million  an increase of million from cash and cash equivalents of million at march   which was a decrease of million from cash and cash equivalents of million at march  the increase in cash and cash equivalents from fiscal years to was primarily due to cash received in the acquisition of clare 
the decrease in cash and cash equivalents from fiscal years to was related to the acquisition of additional manufacturing equipment and cash used in the acquisition of westcode 
cash flows from operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year was million  which was relatively unchanged from million in fiscal year net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year decreased million from the million provided in fiscal year cash flows from investing activities 
net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal year was million  primarily resulting from the net cash acquired in the acquisition of clare offset by purchases of manufacturing equipment 
in fiscal years and  net cash used in investing activities was million and million  respectively 
net cash used in investing activities in was principally used for the 
table of contents acquisition of westcode and for plant and equipment purchases 
net cash used in investing activities in was principally used for plant and equipment purchases 
cash flows from financing activities 
during fiscal year  net cash provided by financing activities was million  which was mainly due to proceeds from loans and exercises of stock options  offset in part  by an increase in restricted cash 
in fiscal years and  net cash provided by financing activities was million and million  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities in was principally proceeds from capital lease obligations  while in it was primarily proceeds from a secondary offering of our common stock  reduced by the repayment of bank debt 
there are three lines of credit facilities available to us 
we have one line of credit with a us bank that consists of a million commitment amount which is available through september the line bears interest at the bank s prime rate at march  
the line is collateralized by certain assets and contains certain general and financial covenants 
at march   we had drawn  against such line of credit 
as of march   we were not in compliance with financial covenants and we received a waiver of non compliance from the lender 
we have another line of credit with a us bank that consists of a  commitment  which is available through september the line bears interest at a fixed rate of 
the line is collateralized by a  certificate of deposit that we have with the bank 
at march   there were no amounts being drawn against such line of credit 
in  ixys semiconductor gmbh obtained a million line of credit with a german bank 
this line supports a letter of credit facility 
at march  there are no amounts outstanding under this line 
in  a german bank issued to ixys a commitment letter for a eur million equipment lease facility 
the equipment leases facility provides financing at varying pricing for periods up to months 
in addition to the rights to the equipment  the bank holds a security interest in the general asset of ixys semiconductor gmbh and unrestricted amounts deposited with the bank 
in  in the same commitment letter discussed above  the bank also committed to issue a credit line to ixys gmbh up to eur million for a wafer fabrication facility in germany  including leasehold improvements  clean room construction and fabrication  computer and office equipment 
at march   we had drawn eur  under this commitment 
the security interest of the bank under the equipment lease facility also collateralizes this line 
in  ixys entered into a term loan with a swiss bank in the amount of sfr  the loan bears interest of and is due in november our accounts receivable at march  were million  an increase of as compared to million at march  our inventories at march  were million  an increase of as compared to million at march  net plant and equipment at march  were million  an increase of as compared to million at march  as of march   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
we believe that these balances  including interest to be earned thereon  and borrowings available under our credit facilities will be sufficient to fund our working and other capital requirements  including potential investments in other companies and other assets to support the strategic growth of our business  over the next twelve months 
in the ordinary course of business  we evaluate opportunities to acquire businesses  products and technologies and we expect to use our cash to fund these types of activities in the future 
in the event additional needs for cash arise  we may raise additional funds from a combination of sources including the potential issuance of debt or equity securities 
additional financing might not be available on terms favorable to us  or at all  particularly in light of the recent decline in the capital markets 
if adequate funds were not available or were not available on acceptable terms  our ability to take advantage of unanticipated opportunities or respond to competitive pressures could be limited 

table of contents disclosures about contractual obligations and commercial commitments details of our contractual obligations and commitments as of march  to make future payments under contracts are set forth below payments due by period less than after contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations pension obligations purchase obligations other liabilities total on september   ixys corporation entered into a guaranty for million in favor of commerzbank ag to obtain a line of credit granted by commerzbank ag to ixys semiconductor gmbh 
at march   there were no amounts outstanding under this line of credit 
new accounting standards in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which addresses accounting for restructuring and similar costs 
sfas no 
supercedes previous accounting guidance  principally emerging issues task force issue  or eitf  no 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under eitf no 
 a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of the entity s commitment to an exit plan 
sfas no 
also requires that the liability be initially measured and recorded at fair value 
sfas no 
was effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  we adopted sfas no 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and its adoption did not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 or fin  entitled guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
it expands previously issued accounting guidance and disclosure requirements for certain guarantees 
fin requires an entity to recognize an initial liability for the fair value of an obligation assumed by issuing a guarantee 
the provision for initial recognition and measurement of the liability will be applied on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  we do not expect this interpretation to have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations or financial position 
we have included additional disclosures in accordance with fin in the footnotes to these consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
sfas no 
also requires that disclosures of the pro forma effect of using the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation be displayed more prominently and in a tabular format 
additionally  sfas no 
requires disclosure of the pro forma effect in interim financial statements 
the additional disclosure requirements of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years ended after december  we will continue to account for stock based compensation in accordance with apb opinion no 
we have included additional disclosures in accordance with sfas no 
in the footnotes to these consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 or fin  entitled consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin requires certain variable interest entities 
table of contents to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin is effective immediately for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after january  for variable interest entities created or acquired prior to february   the provisions of fin must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after june  we believe that the adoption of this standard will have no material impact on our financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  sfas no 
is to be implemented by reporting the cumulative effect of a change in an accounting principle for financial instruments created before the issuance date of the statement and still existing at the beginning of the interim period of adoption 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate  market and credit risk and related change in the market values of our investment portfolio 
we place our investment portfolio primarily in debt instruments of the united states government and high quality corporate issuers 
investments in both fixed and floating rate securities have some degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted by increases in interest rates 
floating rate securities may produce less income than anticipated if interest rates fall 
as a result  changes in interest rates may cause us to incur losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that have declined in market value or may result in lower than anticipated investment income 
our investment portfolio is categorized as available for sale and accordingly is presented at fair value on the balance sheet 
we manage our exposure to interest rate  market and credit risk in the investment portfolio with investment policies and procedures that limit such things as term  credit rating and the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer and type of instrument 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we are also exposed to short term fluctuations in interest rates as our lines of credit have variable interest rates 
an increase in interest rates would have an adverse impact on our interest expense 
however  our cash and marketable securities greatly exceed the balances that we borrow through lines of credit and  if necessary to limit the burden of interest expense  we could reduce our borrowing 
during the year ended march   the effects of changes in interest rates on the fair market value of our marketable investment securities and our earnings were insignificant 
the impact on the fair market value of our securities and our earnings from a hypothetical basis point adverse change in interest rates as of the end each of fiscal and would not have been significant 
international revenues from our foreign subsidiaries were approximately of total revenues in fiscal year these revenues come from our german and uk subsidiaries and are primarily denominated in euros and british pounds  respectively 
our foreign subsidiaries also incur most of their expenses in the local currency 
certain of our foreign subsidiaries use their respective local currencies as their functional currency 
we have not entered into foreign currency hedging transactions  although if circumstances warrant  we may consider such transactions 
it is possible that our future financial results could be directly affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates  and the prices of our products would become more expensive in a particular foreign market if the value of the us dollar  the euro or the british pound rises in comparison to the local currency  which may make it more difficult to sell our products in that market 
we will continue to face foreign currency 
table of contents exchange risk in the future 
therefore  our financial results could be directly affected by weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
in addition  a strengthening of the us dollar  the euro or the british pound could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
a hypothetical increase in the value of the euro against the us dollar and the british pound against the us dollar would have had the effect of reducing our annual net income as of the end of each of fiscal and by an amount less than million
