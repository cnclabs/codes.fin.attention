item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations gives effect to the restatement discussed in note of our consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
results of operations net sales net sales consist of the following components of total of total of total dollars in thousands retail sales    direct to customer    furniture manufacturing total net sales    net sales for the weeks ended february  fiscal  increased million or over net sales for the weeks ended february  fiscal 
the increase in total net sales was due to a million increase in net sales from our retail stores and an million increase in net sales from our direct to customer channel 
we believe that these increases were a result of implementing our repositioning strategy in fiscal  including introduction of new product lines  in particular our premium positioned textiles  re modeling our stores  increases in advertising and events associated with the re launch of our remodeled stores  redesigning our catalog and website  and increases in the number of catalogs mailed  which drive sales in all channels 
net sales for fiscal a week year  increased million or over net sales for the weeks ended february  fiscal 
a decrease of million in net sales from stores and a million decrease in furniture manufacturing sales was offset by an increase of million in net sales from our direct to customer channel 
in addition to negative comparisons as a result of the extra week of sales in the prior year  we believe that fiscal net revenues were affected by the deterioration in the general economic environment which began in  the events of september   and the transitional discounting and inventory reduction activity associated with the implementation of our new merchandising strategy 
furniture manufacturing sales were made only to employees in fiscal and  and primarily to third parties in fiscal total net sales include shipping fees of million  million and million for fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal  respectively 
as of february   we operated stores in states  the district of columbia and canada

at year end retail sales increased by million or in fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily due to a million or increase in comparable store sales 
compared to fiscal  one new store and a warehouse sale event in fiscal accounted for increased sales of million  offset by a decrease of million as a result of fiscal store closures 
the comparable store sales increase resulted from the implementation of our repositioning strategy as described above  in particular  the introduction of our premium positioned textiles  which increased sales in the textile product category to approximately of sales in fiscal from approximately of sales in fiscal retail sales decreased in fiscal as compared to the prior year  primarily due to a million or decrease in comparable store sales  the extra week in fiscal which contributed million in that year  and the closure of three under performing stores 
compared to fiscal  new stores accounted for increased sales of million in fiscal  offset by the comparable store sales decline and a decrease of million as a result of fiscal store closures 
the comparable store sales decrease was due to weak consumer spending over most of fiscal  related to the general economic slowdown and the events of september  average revenue per retail transaction in fiscal increased compared to fiscal  while total retail transactions decreased by 
we attribute the increase in average revenue per transaction to the new product introductions and product mix changes implemented as the integral part of our repositioning strategy 
we believe that the decline in the number of transactions may also be a result of the new product categories and changed mix 
in fiscal  the average revenue per transaction was approximately flat with fiscal  while total retail transactions decreased by 
average revenue per transaction is calculated by dividing the amount of gross sales  exclusive of delivery revenue and sales taxes  by the gross number of transactions 
over the second half of fiscal  as part of our repositioning strategy  we reduced the number of items in our merchandise assortment by  from approximately  to approximately  items 
in connection with this process  under performing products were eliminated and new products were introduced  resulting in the introduction of approximately new product in the first quarter of fiscal comparable store sales are defined as sales from stores whose gross square footage did not change by more than in the previous months and which have been open at least full months 
stores generally become comparable in their th full month of operation 
in any given period  the set of stores comprising comparable stores may be different from the set of comparable stores in the previous period  depending on when stores were opened 
we believe that comparable store sales are a more useful indicator of store performance than the change in total net sales  since comparable store sales exclude the effects of changes in the number of stores open 
direct to customer in thousands except percentages catalog sales    internet sales    total    shipping fees    total direct to customer sales    percentage growth in direct to customer net sales percentage growth in number of catalogs mailed direct to customer sales consist of catalog and internet sales 
net direct to customer sales in fiscal increased million or as compared to fiscal this was a result of a increase in the number of catalogs mailed in fiscal  to million from million in fiscal we also believe that the new textile product introduction  as well as the redesign of our catalog and website  contributed to the sales increase 
net direct to customer sales in fiscal increased million or as compared to fiscal this was a result of a increase in the number of catalogs mailed in fiscal  to million  from million in fiscal offsetting the circulation increase  we believe fiscal direct to customer sales to have been negatively affected by the events of september  and the subsequent anthrax scare 
average revenue per direct to customer transaction in fiscal increased from fiscal  and total direct to customer transactions increased from fiscal we believe the increase in average revenue per transaction is a result of our new product introductions and changed product mix 
in fiscal  the average revenue per transaction increased by from fiscal  and the total number of transactions increased by in april  in connection with our repositioning strategy  we redesigned our catalog and launched a new website to enhance the overall customer experience 
we target our catalog circulation to drive sales in all channels  including the stores and internet 
furniture manufacturing we have a wholly owned furniture manufacturing company located in sacramento  california  the michaels furniture company michaels 
virtually all of the furniture produced at michaels is sold through our retail or direct to customer sales channels  and such sales have been recognized in the sales channel from which the sale originated 
over the past years  we have effectively eliminated sales by michaels to third parties  in order to increase production capacity for inter segment sales 
inter segment sales to restoration hardware represented virtually all of michaels total sales during fiscal and fiscal  and this trend is expected to continue 
expenses the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the percentage of net sales represented by certain line items in our consolidated statement of operations 
net sales cost of sales and occupancy gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses loss from operations interest expense  change in fair value of warrants and interest income loss before income taxes income tax benefit loss before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle cost of sales and occupancy in fiscal  cost of sales and occupancy expense expressed as a percentage of net sales decreased approximately percentage points to  from in fiscal approximately percentage points of this decrease related to certain fiscal charges related to our strategic repositioning  which are detailed below 
approximately percentage points of this decrease was due to improved product margin in fiscal compared to fiscal  driven primarily by better initial markups on our merchandise purchases 
this improvement was due to the addition to our product mix of merchandise with higher gross margin  particularly our new textile categories 
finally the last percentage points of the decrease was due to the leveraging of buying and distribution and occupancy costs by increased sales in fiscal in fiscal  cost of sales and occupancy expenses expressed as a percentage of net sales increased approximately percentage points  to from in fiscal approximately percentage points of this increase was due to charges related to our strategic repositioning  as follows a million charge to reduce certain inventory being eliminated to its net realizable value  a million increase in depreciation charges related to reduced lives of certain long lived assets being replaced in our spring store remodel program  and a million charge related to the write down of long lived assets in eight under performing stores 
these charges are discussed in further detail in the special items section below 
approximately percentage points of the increase was due to markdown and clearance activity associated with our repositioning strategy 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expense expressed as a percentage of net sales increased approximately percentage points to in fiscal  from in fiscal the increase was primarily due to increased advertising costs  resulting from an increase in the number of catalogs mailed to our customers percentage points  increased home office personnel costs due to staffing upgrades and additions implemented in connection with our repositioning strategy percentage points  and increased professional fees incurred in connection with implementing our new revenue recognition policy and the corresponding restatement of prior periods percentage points 
selling  general and administrative expenses expressed as a percentage of net sales increased approximately percentage point to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase was largely due to increased marketing percentage points and other costs percentage points associated with our direct to customer division and increased professional fees associated with our repositioning strategy percentage points  offset by reductions in store and home office payroll percentage points 
interest expense and interest income interest expense includes interest related to the amortization of debt issuance costs and interest on borrowings under our line of credit facility 
in fiscal  interest expense was million as compared to million in fiscal excluding the non cash amortization of debt issuance costs and interest expense related to warrants  interest expense was million compared to million for fiscal  a decrease of million 
the decrease resulted from amendments to our credit facility to provide for more favorable interest rates 
as a result of the paydown of high interest term loans in fiscal  the average interest rate in fiscal decreased to from in fiscal average borrowings in fiscal were million  a slight increase over the average debt level of million in fiscal on august  we amended our credit facility  primarily to reduce the overall commitment from million to million  to provide  at our election  for an additional million of availability above the maximum available designated by formula for any continuous day period between august and october of any year not to exceed the million overall commitment  to extend the expiration date by twelve months to june   and to provide a more favorable interest rate structure 
in fiscal  interest expense was million as compared to million in fiscal excluding the non cash amortization of debt issuance costs  net interest expense was million compared to million for fiscal  a decrease of million 
the decrease resulted from the amendments of our credit facility to provide for more favorable interest rates and a reduction in debt made possible by the million net of fees raised in our preferred and common stock financings in fiscal  as discussed below 
we completed three financing transactions in fiscal in march  we completed a preferred stock financing  appointed gary g 
friedman our new chief executive officer  and amended our credit facility 
in may and november of fiscal  we completed two common stock financings 
combined net proceeds from our preferred stock and common stock transactions of million net of fees were used to pay down our revolving line of credit and for other general corporate purposes 
as a result  average borrowings in fiscal decreased to million from million in fiscal the average interest rate during the same period increased from to  primarily as a result of two high interest term loans that were part of the amendment of the credit facility in september until the anniversary of the amendment in september of fiscal  the existence of these term loans negatively impacted our average interest rate in fiscal as compared to the prior year 
the two term loans were paid off in the second and fourth quarters of fiscal interest income  which consists of income from our short term investments and notes receivable  decreased million in fiscal as compared to fiscal interest income increased million in fiscal as compared to fiscal the majority of the changes in was due to interest on a million loan we provided to mr 
friedman in connection with his purchase of common stock and preferred stock in march mr 
friedman repaid the loan in full  including accrued interest  in august income tax benefit our effective tax benefit rate was in fiscal  as compared to a tax benefit rate of in fiscal  and a tax benefit rate of in fiscal these rates reflect the effect of aggregate state tax rates based on a mix of retail sales and direct to customer sales in the various states in which we have sales revenue or conduct business 
additionally  the fiscal income tax benefit rate reflects a million reduction in the valuation allowance previously established on our deferred tax assets 
the reduction in the valuation allowance was due to the additional realization of net operating loss carryback amounts  resulting from the economic stimulus bill enacted on march  the fiscal income tax benefit was net of a million valuation allowance provision to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that management believed was more likely than not to be realized  as further discussed in critical accounting policies below 
under the applicable accounting literature  we were not allowed to consider the potential effects of a tax law change when we established the valuation allowance at february  as a result  even though the economic stimulus bill was approved prior to the issuance of our financial statements  we were not allowed to reflect the potential positive effects on the overall valuation allowance until the year of the law change 
as a result  we established the million reserve at february  and reduced the reserve in the first quarter ended may  fiscal special items fiscal included special item charges of approximately million 
a discussion of these charges follows 
inventory lower of cost or market reserve in connection with the elimination of approximately of the items from our merchandise assortment during fiscal  we recorded a charge of million to write down discontinued merchandise to its estimated net realizable value 
depreciation at the beginning of the fourth quarter  concurrent with our november  private placement of common stock  we finalized our decision to remodel our stores in the first quarter of fiscal as a result  we recorded an increase in depreciation charges of million in order to reflect the shortened useful lives of store fixtures and leasehold assets which were scheduled to be replaced 
asset impairment charge in the course of performing our periodic cash flow analysis of our mature stores  we determined that an asset impairment charge of million was required for eight underperforming locations 
the impairment charge was calculated as the difference between the net book value of the store s long lived assets and the present value of the store s estimated future cash flows over the remaining life of the lease 
tax valuation allowance in the course of analyzing our projected taxable income  we determined that a valuation allowance of million against our deferred tax assets was appropriate as of february  the valuation allowance reduced our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
liquidity and capital resources operating cash flows in fiscal  net cash used in operating activities was million compared to million of net cash provided by operations in fiscal cash was used in operations in fiscal to fund increased merchandise inventories from the unusually depressed inventory levels at the end of fiscal  as we exited old product in preparation for the receipt of new goods for the launch of our merchandise repositioning 
the cash used for inventory investment in fiscal was partially offset by our smaller operating loss  driven by increased sales and improved merchandise margins  and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
in fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities decreased million to million  from million in fiscal cash provided by operating activities decreased largely because of the following factors the increased operating losses resulting from a deterioration in merchandise margins due to increased cost of sales associated with our repositioning strategy  increased cash used to pay down accounts payable and other accrued expenses  and a reduction in cash provided from deferred lease incentives 
these factors were partially offset by the reduction in inventory levels discussed above  and a reduction in accounts receivable 
investing cash flows net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal  an increase of million compared to million of cash provided by investing activities in fiscal cash was used primarily for the re modeling of substantially all of our stores approximately million  in addition to smaller investments to open one new store  re engineer our website  and implement productivity enhancements in our distribution centers and michael s furniture operation 
net cash provided by investing activities was million in fiscal  compared to million of cash used in investing activities in fiscal the majority of the change is due to a reduction in capital expenditures as a result of opening only one store in fiscal as compared to in fiscal additionally  in fiscal  we entered into agreements with a third party to cancel leases and close three of our under performing locations  for which we received million 
financing cash flows net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal  an increase of million from million in fiscal in fiscal the net cash provided by financing activities was primarily from our credit facility  in addition to the repayment of a million loan by gary g 
friedman  our president and chief executive officer 
net cash provided by financing activities increased million  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal in march of  we completed a preferred stock financing  appointed a new chief executive officer and amended our credit facility 
in may and november of  we completed two common stock financings with various institutional investors 
combined net proceeds from our preferred stock financing and common stock transactions were million and were used primarily to pay down our line of credit and for other general corporate purposes 
at february   we had in place a credit facility with an overall commitment of million  of which million was available for letters of credit 
as of february   we had million outstanding under the line of credit before unamortized debt issuance costs of million  and million in outstanding letters of credit 
interest is paid monthly at the bank s reference rate or libor plus a margin 
as of february   the bank s reference rate was and the libor plus margin rate was 
the availability of credit at any given time under the credit facility is limited by reference to a borrowing base formula based upon numerous factors  including eligible inventory and eligible accounts receivable 
the amount available under the credit facility may be less than the stated maximum of the facility 
as of february   in addition to outstanding borrowings and letter of credit obligations totaling million  we had availability to borrow up to million 
the credit facility contains various restrictive covenants  including limitations on our annual capital expenditures  ability to incur additional debt  acquisition of other businesses and payment of dividends and other distributions 
the agreement expires on june  in august we amended our credit facility  primarily to reduce the overall commitment from million to million  at our election  to provide for an additional million of availability above the maximum available designated by formula for any continuous day period between august and october of any year not to exceed the million overall commitment  to extend the expiration date of the credit facility by twelve months to june   and to provide a more favorable interest rate structure 
in november  the credit facility was further amended and restated to reflect a number of minor revisions and updates to the then existing credit facility documentation 
in connection with an amendment to our line of credit in september  we issued putable warrants for the purchase of  shares of our common stock  subject to anti dilution protections at per share 
in connection with the amendment of the credit facility in march   of the  warrants were repriced to per share 
the fair value of the warrants is calculated each quarter using the black scholes model 
the following assumptions were used in our calculation as of february  expected life of months  stock volatility considered to be  risk free interest rate of  and no dividends during the expected term 
for fiscal  the mark to market revaluation of the warrants resulted in a charge of approximately million against earnings 
the warrants were to expire on september   and  as of february  warrants for the purchase of approximately  shares of common stock remained outstanding 
during the first quarter of fiscal  all of the remaining warrants were exercised 
we currently believe that our cash flows from operations and funds available under our credit facility will satisfy our expected working capital and capital requirements  including our contractual commitments described below  for at least the next months 
however  the weakening of  or other adverse developments concerning our sales performance or adverse developments concerning the availability of credit under our credit facility due to covenant limitations or other factors could limit the overall availability of funds to us 
moreover  we may not have successfully anticipated our future capital needs and we may need to raise additional funds in order to take advantage of unanticipated opportunities 
we also may need to raise additional funds to respond to changing business conditions or unanticipated competitive pressures 
however  should the need arise  additional sources of financing may not be available or  if available  may not be on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
if we fail to raise sufficient funds  we may be required to delay or abandon some of our planned future expenditures or aspects of our current operations 
for more information  please see the section factors that may affect our future operating results  above  in particular the sections we are dependent on external funding sources which may not make available to us sufficient funds when we need them  and because our business requires a substantial level of liquidity  we are dependent upon a credit facility with numerous restrictive covenants that limit our flexibility 
contractual commitments the following table summarizes significant contractual obligations of the company as of february  amount of commitment expiration period total less than year years years after years contractual obligations long term debt operating leases      capital leases other long term obligations total contractual cash obligations    amount of commitment expiration period total less than year years years after years other commercial commitments revolving credit facility   standby letters of credit   trade letters of credit   total commercial commitments    amount outstanding under the revolving credit facility at february  was million 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to product returns  bad debts  inventories  goodwill  taxes on income  financing operations  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other facts and assumptions  including current and expected economic conditions and product mix  that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our management believes the following critical accounting policies require significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements inventory our retail inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a weighted average cost method 
manufacturing inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a first in  first out method 
we write down inventories whenever permanent markdowns reduce the selling price below cost 
additionally  we provide for reserves on inventory based upon our estimate of shrink losses 
at february  and february  we had reserves of  and million  respectively  to adjust the carrying amount of our merchandise inventories to their estimated net realizable value 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  or if liquidation of the inventory is more difficult than anticipated  additional inventory write downs may be required 
deferred catalog expenses deferred catalog expenses consist of the cost to prepare  print and distribute catalogs 
such costs are amortized over the estimated sales volume of each catalog 
we estimate expected sales volume based on historical experience 
typically over of the cost of a catalog is amortized in the first four months  and all catalog costs are generally fully amortized within six months 
property and equipment property and equipment are stated at cost 
depreciation is calculated using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the asset  typically ranging from three to ten years for all property and equipment except for leasehold improvements and lease acquisition costs 
the cost of leasehold improvements and lease acquisitions is amortized over the useful life of the asset or applicable lease term  whichever is less 
impairment of long lived assets we review long lived tangible assets and intangible assets with finite useful lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable 
using our best estimates based on reasonable assumptions and projections  we record an impairment loss to write the assets down to their estimated fair values if the carrying values of such assets exceed their related undiscounted expected future cash flows 
in the course of performing this analysis  we recorded impairment charges in fiscal and fiscal of million and million  respectively 
we had million of goodwill at february  and february  we review goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite useful lives for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances warrant 
if the carrying values of such assets exceed their estimated fair values  we record an impairment loss to write the assets down to their estimated fair values 
there were no impairment charges recorded against goodwill in fiscal or fiscal we generally evaluate long lived tangible assets and intangible assets with finite useful lives at an individual store level  which is the lowest level at which independent cash flows can be identified 
we evaluate corporate assets or other long lived assets that are not store specific at a consolidated entity or segment level  as appropriate 
since there is typically no active market for our long lived tangible and intangible assets  we estimate fair values based on the expected present value of future cash flows 
we estimate future cash flows based on store level historical results  current trends and operating and cash flow projections 
our estimates are subject to substantial uncertainty and may be affected by a number of factors outside our control  including general economic conditions  the competitive environment and regulatory changes 
if actual results differ from our estimates  we may record significant additional impairment charges in the future 
store closure reserves prior to january   we recorded the estimated costs associated with closing a store during the period in which the store was identified and approved by management under a plan of termination  which included the method of disposition and the expected date of completion 
these costs include direct costs to terminate a lease  lease rental payments net of expected sublease income  and the difference between the carrying values and estimated recoverable values of long lived tangible and intangible assets 
we recorded severance and other employee related costs in the period in which we communicated the closure and related severance packages to the affected employees 
effective with the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  on january  see recent accounting developments below  we recognize a liability for costs associated with closing a store when the liability is incurred 
we record the present value of expected future lease costs and other closure costs when the store is closed 
we record severance and other employee related costs in the period in which we communicate the closure and related severance packages to the affected employees 
our calculation of store closure costs includes significant estimates about the amounts and timing of potential lease termination costs and future sublease income 
these estimates are based on our historical experience  the condition and location of the property  the lease terms and current real estate leasing market conditions 
if actual results differ from our estimates  we may significantly adjust our store closure reserves in future periods 
while we do not currently have any reserves established for store closures  we periodically make judgments about which stores we should close and which stores we should continue to operate 
all stores are subject to regular monitoring of their financial performance and cash flows  and many stores are subject to kick out clauses which allow us to terminate the store lease without further obligation if certain contractually specified sales levels are not achieved 
if we decide to close a number of these stores  we may incur significant store closure costs for which we have not currently reserved 
self insurance we obtain insurance coverage for significant exposures as well as those risks required to be insured by law 
it is generally our policy to retain a significant portion of certain losses related to workers compensation  general liability  property losses  business interruptions and employee health care 
we record provisions for these items based on claims experience  regulatory changes  an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported and other relevant factors 
the projections involved in this estimate are subject to substantial uncertainty because of several unpredictable factors  including actual claims experience  regulatory changes  litigation trends and changes in inflation 
our self insurance exposure is concentrated in california  where the majority of our stores are located 
california has experienced significant increases in workers compensation costs as a result of legislative changes and rising medical costs 
these increases have adversely affected our results of operations and may continue to adversely affect us in the future 
if claims are greater than we originally estimate  or if costs increase beyond what we anticipated  our recorded reserves may not be sufficient  and we may record significant additional expense 
income taxes we account for income taxes under statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
requires income taxes to be accounted for under an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
in estimating future tax consequences  all expected future events then known to us are considered  other than changes in the tax law or rates 
accordingly  we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
an analysis of projected taxable income and the corresponding utilization of these tax assets indicated that valuation allowances of million and million were required as of february  and february   respectively 
the amount of valuation allowance is based upon management s best estimate of the recoverability of its deferred tax assets 
while future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning were considered in determining the amount of the valuation allowance  this allowance is subject to adjustment in the future 
specifically  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amounts  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
the fiscal income tax benefit rate reflects a million reduction in the valuation allowance previously established on our deferred tax assets 
the reduction in the valuation allowance was due to the additional realization of net operating loss carryback amounts  resulting from the economic stimulus bill enacted on march  the fiscal income tax benefit was net of a million valuation allowance provision to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that management believed was more likely than not to be realized 
under the applicable accounting literature  we were not allowed to consider the potential effects of a tax law change when we established the valuation allowance at february  as a result  even though the economic stimulus bill was approved prior to the issuance of our financial statements  we were not allowed to reflect the potential positive effects on the overall valuation allowance until the year of the law change 
as a result  we established the million reserve at february  and reduced the reserve in the first quarter ended may  revenue recognition retail stores sales revenue is recognized at the point of sales for all purchases which are taken from the store by the customer at the time of purchase 
furniture sales furniture sales are recorded as either direct to customer sales or retail sales depending upon where the sales transaction originated 
the majority of furniture sales involve the shipment of furniture to the customer 
revenue for these sales is recognized at the time of customer receipt 
non furniture direct to customer catalog and internet sales revenue is recognized at the time of customer receipt 
shipping and handling we record shipping and handling fees as net revenue in the sales channel segment retail sales or direct to customer sales that originated the sales transaction 
costs of shipping and handling are included in cost of sales and occupancy 
returns we provide an allowance for sales returns based on historical return rates 
contingencies and litigation we are involved from time to time in legal proceedings  including litigation arising in the ordinary course of our business 
due to the uncertainties inherent in any legal proceeding  we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any proceeding and may incur substantial costs to defend the proceeding  irrespective of the merits 
unfavorable outcome of any legal proceeding could have an adverse impact on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
as appropriate  we assess the likelihood of any adverse outcomes and the potential range of probable losses 
the amount of loss accrual  if any  is subject to adjustment if and when warranted by new developments or revised strategies 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions related to these proceedings 
we accrue our best estimates of the probable cost for the resolution of legal claims 
such estimates are developed in consultation with outside counsel handling these matters and are based upon a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
to the extent additional information arises or our strategies change  it is possible that our best estimates of our probable liability in these matters may change 
other considerations the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles 
recent accounting developments in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which became effective for us on february  sfas no 
specifies that goodwill and certain intangible assets will no longer be amortized but instead will be subject to periodic impairment testing 
we adopted sfas in the first quarter of fiscal upon adoption we discontinued the amortization of goodwill with a carrying value of million as of february  see note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of reported loss per share to the amounts adjusted for the exclusion of amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives  net of the related income tax effects

supersedes previous accounting guidance  principally emerging issues task force issue no 
we have adopted the provisions of sfas no 
for restructuring activities  if any  initiated after december  sfas no 
requires that the liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under issue  a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of our commitment to an exit plan 
sfas no 
also establishes that the liability should initially be measured and recorded at fair value 
accordingly  sfas no 
may affect the timing of recognizing future restructuring costs as well as the amounts recognized

elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also requires that a guarantor recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the disclosure requirements of fin no

restatement subsequent to the issuance of our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended february   we determined that certain errors existed in our previously issued consolidated financial statements 
we determined that our accounts payable balances at february  were overstated resulting from the inclusion of fiscal payables in fiscal we also determined that our inventory at february  was understated as a result of our inventories in transit being excluded from our reported inventory balance 
finally  for the year ended february   we determined that we had understated certain payroll and insurance costs and overstated certain maintenance costs 
as a result  the accompanying fiscal financial statements have been restated from amounts previously reported in amendment no

such forward looking statements include statements as to the results of strategic initiatives  our working capital and capital expenditure needs  the impact of competition and other statements containing words such as believes  anticipates  estimates  expects  may  intends  and words of similar import or statements of our management s opinion

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks  which include changes in interest rates and  to a lesser extent  foreign exchange rates 
we do not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes 
the interest payable on our credit facility is based on variable interest rates and is  therefore  affected by changes in market interest rates 
if interest rates on existing variable rate debt rose no more than from the bank s reference rate  our results of operations and cash flows would not be materially affected 
in addition  we have fixed and variable income investments consisting of cash equivalents and short term investments  which are also affected by changes in market interest rates 
we do enter into a significant amount of purchase obligations outside of the united states which  to date  have been settled mostly in us dollars and  therefore  we have only minimal exposure at present to foreign currency exchange risks 
historically  we have not hedged our currency risk and do not currently anticipate doing so in the future 
however  it is possible that in the future a growing number of our purchases outside of the united states will be made in currencies other than the us dollar 
consequently  fluctuations in the rates of exchange between the us dollar and other currencies may subject us to foreign currency exchange risks in the future
