our policy is to manage interest rates through the use of fixed rate long term debt and  to a lesser extent  short term debt 
the company s interest rate risk related to existing fixed rate  long term debt is not material due to the term of the majority of our first mortgage bonds  which have final maturity dates ranging from to over the next twelve months  approximately million of the current portion of nine existing long term debt instruments will mature 
combining this amount with the million in short term debt outstanding at december   and applying a hypothetical change in the rate of interest charged by on those borrowings  would not have a material effect on earnings
