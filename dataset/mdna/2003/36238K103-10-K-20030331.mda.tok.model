changes in sales throughout the company s history have been attributable to increased or decreased unit sales  to expansion of the company s product offerings eg  peripherals  networking  unix servers workstation and internet products  to the addition removal of vendors eg  the addition of cisco  emc  tachyon  rim  and the removal of nexar and everex  and to the addition or expiration of sales contract vehicles eg  the addition of the sewp iii  admc  it and the mmad contracts  and the expiration of the sewp ii  pc  sii pc lan  and portables contracts

increased sales under a distribution agreement with a major vendor also contributed to the increase in subcontracts and other contracts category 
the million increase in sales in the idiq contracts category is primarily related to increased sales under established contract vehicles 
idiq contracts sales were also helped by sales from a new contract awarded to the company in the gsa schedule category increased million due primarily to the government converting some of the company s legacy idiq contracts to bpa contracts at contract renewal 
this caused a shift in sales from the idiq category to the bpa contracts category during the company was also awarded several new bpa contracts during that also contributed to the increase in bpa contract sales

the increase of million in the company s gsa schedules is due to sales on the newly awarded army admc bpa and federal reserve bank bpas

critical accounting policies we have included below our policies that are both important to our financial condition and operating results  and require management s most subjective and complex judgments in determining the underlying estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates  as they require assumptions that are inherently uncertain 
cash and cash equivalents 
the company considers all investments with maturity of three months or less on their acquisition date to be cash equivalents 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from hardware product sales when the title to the products sold passes to the customer  with provisions established for estimated product returns 
based on our standard shipping terms  title generally passes upon the customer s receipt of the products 
we recognize revenues under sales type lease arrangements in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for leases 
we recognize revenue from software products in accordance with the provisions of american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  software revenue recognition 
revenue from software product sales is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the software has been delivered  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is probable 
we recognize net revenues from sales of third party software maintenance contracts at the time of the sale 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our historical experiences and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same loss rates that we have in the past 
sales of lease receivables 
we periodically sell lease receivables to unrelated financing companies 
we account for our sales of lease receivables in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities a replacement of fasb statement no 
inventories 
we value our inventory at the lower of average cost or market value of the inventory 
whenever possible  we order inventory only as needed 
however  we do maintain inventory related to certain products or vendors 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess or obsolete inventory 
in the future  if our inventory is determined to be overvalued  we will be required to recognize such costs in our cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
therefore  although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
long lived assets 
long lived assets  consisting primarily of property and equipment and capitalized software  are currently reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount should be addressed pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we determine impairment by comparing the carrying value of these long lived assets to a probability weighted estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of these assets and their eventual disposition 
the cash flow projections used to make this assessment is consistent with the cash flow projections we use internally to assist us in making key decisions 
if we determine that an impairment exists  a loss would be recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the assets  which is generally determined by using quoted market prices or valuation techniques such as the discounted present value of expected future cash flows  appraisals  or other pricing models as appropriate 
warranties 
we offer warranties on sales under certain products specific to the terms of the customer agreements 
our standard warranties require us to repair or replace defective products reported to us during such warranty period at no cost to the customer 
we record an estimate for warranty related costs at the time of sale based on our actual historical return rates and repair costs at the time of sale 
while our warranty costs have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same warranty return rates or repair costs that we have in the past 
a significant increase in product return rates  or a significant increase in the costs to repair products sold  could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period or periods in which such events occur 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb approved sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
prospectively prohibits the pooling of interest method of accounting for business combinations initiated after june  sfas no 
requires companies to cease amortizing goodwill that existed at june  the amortization of existing goodwill will cease on december  any goodwill resulting from acquisitions completed after june  will not be amortized 
sfas no 
also establishes a new method of testing goodwill and certain intangibles for impairment on an annual basis or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
the adoption of these standards did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements or its results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
the purpose of this statement is to develop consistent accounting for asset retirement obligations and related costs in the financial statements and provide more information about future cash outflows  leverage and liquidity regarding retirement obligations and the gross investment in long lived assets 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after june  the company will be required to implement sfas no 
on january  the company does not believe that adoption of this standard will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements or its results of operations 
in july of  the fasb issued sfas no  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the principal difference between statement no 
and issue relates to statement s requirements for recognition of a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity 
statement no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under issue  a liability for an exit cost as generally defined in issue was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
a fundamental conclusion in this statement is that an entity s commitment to a plan  by itself  does not create an obligation that meets the definition of a liability 
therefore  this statement eliminates the definition and requirements for recognition of exit costs in issue this statement also establishes that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability 
the provisions of this statement are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements of the company 
in november  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin elaborates on the disclosure to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of fin are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements of fin are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  the company does not expect adoption of fin to have a material effect on its financial condition  results of operations of liquidity 
in january  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
fin clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from the other parties 
fin applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january  the company is currently in the process of evaluating what impact  if any  fin will have on its financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
effect of inflation the company believes that inflation has not had a material effect on its operations 
if  however  inflation increases in the future it could temporarily adversely affect the profitability of gtsi s sales under its government fixed price contracts  which generally preclude the company from passing on inflation related or other increases in product costs to government customers during the term of a pre existing contract 
the company mitigates this risk in part by often obtaining agreements from certain of its suppliers prohibiting them from increasing their prices to gtsi during the term of fixed price contracts 
seasonal fluctuations and other risk factors the company has historically experienced and expects to continue to experience significant seasonal fluctuations in its operations as a result of government buying and funding patterns  which also affect the buying patterns of gtsi s prime contractor customers 
these buying and funding patterns historically have had a significant positive effect on gtsi s bookings in the third quarter ending september each year the government s fiscal year end  and consequently on sales and net income in the third and fourth quarters of each year 
quarterly financial results are also affected by the timing of the award and shipments of products under government contracts  price competition in the industry  the addition of personnel or other expenses in anticipation of sales growth  product line changes and expansions  and the timing and costs of changes in customer and product mix 
in addition  customer order deferrals in anticipation of new product releases by leading manufacturers  delays in vendor shipments of new or existing products  a shift in sales mix to more complex requirements contracts with more complex service costs  and vendor delays in the processing of incentives and credits due gtsi  have occurred all of which are also likely to occur in the future and have adversely affected the company s operating performance in particular periods 
the seasonality and the unpredictability of the factors affecting such seasonality make gtsi s quarterly and yearly financial results difficult to predict and subject to significant fluctuation 
the company s stock price could be adversely affected if any such financial results fail to meet the financial community s expectations 
additionally  legislation is periodically introduced in congress that may change the government s procurement practices 
gtsi cannot predict whether any legislative or any regulatory proposals will be adopted or  if adopted  the impact upon its operating results 
changes in the structure  composition and or buying patterns of the government  either alone or in combination with competitive conditions or other factors  could adversely affect future results 
in december  the company purchased million of business intelligence software 
contractually  the company has the right to sell this business intelligence software to various government agencies through june  through december   the company had sold approximately  of this product 
based on its sales history and the continued challenges with selling this product  the company s management believes that the remaining million of the business intelligence software inventory was impaired and as a result wrote off the remaining unsold balance in liquidity and capital resources during  the company s operating activities provided approximately million of cash  compared to million used by operations in sources of cash provided by operating activities in include a reduction in lease receivables of million and merchandise inventories of million  and an increase in accrued liabilities and warranty liabilities of million offset by reductions in accounts payable of million and an increase in other assets of million 
accounts receivable are substantially unchanged year over year  however trade accounts receivable increased million due to increased sales 
the increase in trade accounts receivable was partially offset by a decrease of in various receivables due from vendors 
the cash generated from lease receivables resulted from the sale of equipment leases during the first quarter of the increase in other assets was primarily due to a strategic prepaid inventory arrangement for million at december  the decrease in accounts payable was primarily due to management taking advantage of strategic inventory pre buys and prompt payment discounts during investing activities used cash of approximately million in primarily for the company s investment in software for a new fulfillment system  designed to improve efficiency throughout the company 
the company is internally developing software to replace its current fulfillment system 
as of december   the company has capitalized approximately million dollars under this project 
the company s financing activities used approximately million of cash during due to payments under its line of credit of million and  used to repurchase the common stock of the company partially offset by million in proceeds from stock options exercised 
the company has a revolving line of credit the revolver with a group of banks  which allows for borrowings up to million during its highest seasonal period 
additionally  the company has a separate facility with a bank for inventory financing of vendor products the wholesale financing facility  which allows for borrowings up to million during its highest seasonal period 
combined the revolver and the wholesale financing facility the credit facilities allow the company to borrow from million to million depending on the seasonal period 
the seasonal structure of the credit facilities coincides with the seasonality of the company s business and allows the company to minimize banking fees 
the interest rate under the credit facilities is a rate indexed to the london interbank offered rate libor 
as of december    and  the company s interest rate on the revolver was   and  respectively 
amounts due to the banks of million as of december  are classified as current liabilities down from million as of december  the available portion of the credit facility was approximately million at december   up from million at december  borrowing is limited to of eligible accounts receivable 
the credit facility is secured by substantially all of the company s operating assets 
current obligations are first funded and then all cash receipts are automatically applied to reduce outstanding borrowings 
the credit facility also contains certain covenants that include restrictions on the payment of dividends and the purchase of the company s common stock  as well as provisions specifying compliance with certain quarterly and annual financial ratios 
at december   the company was in compliance with all financial covenants set forth in the credit facility 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has a million credit facility indexed at libor plus 
this variable rate credit facility subjects the company to potential cash flow exposure resulting from changes in interest rates
