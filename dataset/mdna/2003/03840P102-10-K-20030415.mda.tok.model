item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial review this review of performance is organized by business segment  reflecting the way we managed our business during the periods covered by this report 
each business group leader is responsible for operating results down to earnings before interest and taxes ebit 
we use ebit as a performance measure as it captures the income and expenses within the management control of our segment business leaders 
corporate management is responsible for making all financing decisions 
therefore  each segment discussion focuses on the factors affecting ebit  while financing and income taxes are separately discussed at the corporate level 
the use of ebit as a performance measure is not meant to be considered an alternative to net income or cash flows from operating activities  which are determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  as an indicator of operating performance or as a measure of liquidity  or other performance measures used under gaap 
in addition  the term may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities

cumulative effect of accounting change 
net income loss key factors impacting ebit our total ebit decreased significantly in compared to key factors affecting results were as follows we exited from the wholesale energy trading business during the third quarter of and incurred trading and contract losses of million during the last half of the year that related to our exit 
this business contributed ebit of approximately million in the third and fourth quarters of  compared to a loss before interest and taxes of million in  before impairments and restructuring charges 
less volatile commodity prices in the first half of compared to a robust commodity environment in the same period of resulted in a million decrease in ebit from wholesale services  before restructuring and impairment charges 
in  we incurred million of restructuring charges in connection with the realignment of our domestic networks business and the exit from our wholesale energy trading business 
as a result of asset sales and impairments  we recorded impairment charges and net losses on sale of assets of  million in lower power prices and higher natural gas prices in resulted in narrow spark spreads the difference between the price at which electricity is sold and the cost of the fuel used to generate it which reduced or eliminated the economic benefits of running certain power plants and exercising power generation rights under our tolling contracts 
these conditions also negatively impacted our ability to sell additional generation capacity that came on line 
ebit for capacity services in was down million when compared to  before impairments and restructuring charges 
cumulative effect of accounting change in october  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus to rescind eitf no 
 accounting for contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities 
by rescinding eitf  all contracts that would have otherwise been accounted for under eitf and that do not fall within the scope of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  sfas should no longer be marked to market through earnings 
we elected to adopt this requirement in october and thus reversed million or million on an after tax basis of earnings previously recognized 
restructuring charges as further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we recorded restructuring charges for the year ended december  that consisted of the following in millions year ended december  domestic networks severance costs disposition of corporate aircraft total domestic networks capacity services interest rate swap reductions total capacity services wholesale services severance costs retention payments lease agreements write down of leasehold improvements and equipment loss on termination of aggregator loan program disposition of corporate aircraft other total wholesale services corporate and other severance costs total restructuring charges impairment charges and net loss on sale of assets as further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we recorded the following impairment charges and net loss on sale of assets for the years ended december   and year ended december  in millions domestic networks quanta services everest connections and other communication investments enron exposure gas distribution system total domestic networks international networks midlands multinet and alintagas other total international networks capacity services turbines exit from lodi gas storage investment termination of cogentrix acquisition capacity services goodwill other total capacity services wholesale services wholesale services goodwill enron exposure other total wholesale services corporate and other information technology assets corporate identity intangibles total corporate and other total impairment charges and net loss on sale of assets  during  we also incurred a million loss on an impairment charge and net losses on asset sales that are reflected in discontinued operations and is not included in the table above 
see the paragraph below for further discussion of these charges 
discontinued operations as further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  in connection with the sales of our gas storage facility  our gas gathering and pipeline assets  our merchant loan portfolio and our coal handling facility  we have reported the results of these businesses in discontinued operations for the years ended december   and in the consolidated statements of income 
operating results of discontinued operations are as follows year ended december  in millions sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses operating expense impairment charges and net loss on sale of assets depreciation and amortization expense total operating expenses other income expense equity in losses earnings of investments 
other income expense earnings loss before interest and taxes interest expense earnings loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit earnings loss from discontinued operations versus sales  cost of sales and gross profit sales  cost of sales and gross profit decreased million  million and million  respectively  in compared to these decreases were primarily due to lower natural gas liquids prices and throughput volumes for the first three quarters of as compared to the same period in as a result  sales  cost of sales and gross profit from our gas gathering and pipeline business all decreased by million  million and million  respectively 
the sale of these operations on october   as compared to a full fourth quarter of operations in  caused a further reduction in sales  cost of sales and gross profit of million  million and million  respectively 
impairment charges and net loss on sale of assets in  we incurred a million loss on the sale of our gas gathering and pipeline assets  a million loss on the sale of our merchant loan portfolio  a million impairment of our coal handling facility and a million pretax gain on sale of our gas storage assets 
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense decreased in by million primarily as a result of the sale of our gas gathering and pipeline assets in october income tax expense benefit our current year losses resulted in an income tax benefit in  as compared to income tax expense in due to earnings 
in  million of our losses will be treated as capital losses for income tax purposes 
because capital losses can only offset capital gains  and we do not have sufficient capital gains in prior years to offset all of these losses  nor can we be assured of generating any future capital gains  we recorded a million valuation allowance against our capital loss carryforward 
in addition  the above impairment charges and net loss on sale of assets include the effects of million of goodwill and other intangibles that were not deductible for income tax purposes 
versus sales  cost of sales and gross profit sales  cost of sales and gross profit decreased million  million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  compared to these decreases were primarily due to a decline in natural gas throughput volumes from our gas gathering and pipeline assets in when compared to in addition  lower natural gas liquids prices caused further decreases to our sales  cost of sales and gross profit in operating expense operating expense decreased million in from primarily due to a decrease in provisions for bad debts in the merchant services loan portfolio 
impairments and net loss on sale of assets in  we recognized asset impairment charges of million with respect to our assessment of certain under performing pipeline assets 
interest expense interest expense decreased million in compared to the majority of interest expense represents inter company interest charges from corporate that are eliminated in consolidation 
lower interest expense in resulted from the repayment of inter company debt and the way interest expense was being allocated to the various business units 
global networks group our global networks group consists of our investments in domestic and international regulated electric  gas and communications networks 
domestic networks is principally made up of our electric and gas regulated utility businesses  which operate as aquila networks in colorado  iowa  kansas  michigan  minnesota  missouri and nebraska 
also included is our owned subsidiary  everest connections  a communications business which provides local and long distance telephone  cable television and high speed internet service to areas of greater kansas city 
additionally  our results for the three years ended december  includes our ownership interest in quanta services  inc  a provider of field services to electric utilities  telecommunications and cable television companies  and governmental entities 
we began selling down our ownership interest in quanta in july and sold our remaining million shares in february international networks includes our investments in canada  australia and the united kingdom 
our wholly owned canadian electric distribution companies have operations in the provinces of alberta and british columbia 
our australian investments include a interest in united energy limited uel  an electric distribution company in the melbourne area  a interest in multinet gas  a gas distribution company in the melbourne area  and a interest  held jointly with uel  in alintagas limited  a gas distribution company in western australia 
our united kingdom investment consists of a interest in avon energy partners holding company  the holding company for midlands electricity  an electric distribution company in central england 
midlands also owns a combined megawatts of net generation capacity in the united kingdom  turkey and pakistan 
included in our results for the three years ending december   are the earnings from our investment in unitednetworks  a new zealand gas and electric distribution company that was sold in october three year review domestic networks year ended december  dollars in millions sales    cost of sales    gross profit operating expenses operating expense restructuring charges impairment charges and net loss on sale of assets depreciation and amortization expense total operating expenses  other income expense equity in earnings of investments minority interest other income expense earnings loss before interest and taxes identifiable assets electric sales and transportation volumes gwh   gas sales and transportation volumes mcf   electric customers    gas customers    versus sales  cost of sales and gross profit sales and cost of sales for the domestic networks businesses decreased million and million  respectively  in compared to these decreases were primarily the result of lower gas prices and mild winter weather in  both of which impacted sales and cost of sales 
because gas purchase costs for our gas utility networks are passed through to our customers  the change in gas prices did not have a corresponding impact on our gross profit 
gross profit decreased million primarily as the result of million in off system power sales that were not repeated in gross profit decreased an additional million due to the sale of our missouri pipeline business in january operating expense operating expense decreased million in compared to the decrease in operating expense was primarily due to reduced expenses in everest connections resulting from the elimination of costs associated with our telecommunications consulting operation in early  greater operating efficiencies and the suspension of incentive payments under the long term incentive plan 
although there were significant labor savings in our regulated business due to a reduction in workforce and annual incentives  these amounts were offset by increased pension costs  costs associated with our proxy contest with quanta services and expenses related to certain regulatory matters 
restructuring charges as a result of the restructuring of our domestic utility business to more closely align it with our state service areas  we incurred million in restructuring costs  primarily in the form of severance for terminated employees and the disposition of our corporate aircraft operation 
impairment charges and net loss on sale of assets as further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  domestic networks incurred million of losses resulting from impairments and asset sales in the impairments consisted primarily of million of impairment losses related to our investment in quanta services and million of impairment losses related to everest and other communication technology investments 
in addition  we recorded a million asset impairment charge related to a local natural gas distribution system deemed unrecoverable in one of our regulatory jurisdictions 
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense decreased million  of which million was due to the elimination of goodwill amortization attributed to our quanta services investment and our acquisition of st 
joseph light power company 
also impacting depreciation and amortization expense was a million decrease in depreciation resulting from our recent missouri electric rate case 
these decreases were offset in part by a million increase in depreciation expense on additional communication networks placed in service during late and equity in earnings of investments equity in earnings of investments decreased million in compared to the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in equity earnings from our quanta services investment resulting from quanta services lower earnings in and a reduction of our ownership percentage in quanta services from to during partially offsetting quanta services lower earnings was the elimination of approximately million of goodwill amortization that was previously in the financial statements of quanta services 
other income expense other income expense decreased million in from this decrease was primarily due to the loss of interest earned in on the note receivable from enron discussed below 
versus sales  cost of sales and gross profit sales  cost of sales and gross profit for our domestic networks businesses increased in millions  and  respectively  in compared to increased sales and cost of sales were mainly driven by higher natural gas prices in early our acquisition of st 
joseph light power company in december contributed sales  cost of sales and gross profit of in millions  and  respectively 
gross profit in also increased million due to stronger off system power sales 
operating expense operating expense increased million in compared to due to the inclusion of a full year s operations of st 
joseph light power  which had operating expenses of million 
start up operating expenses in connection with the build out of everest connections contributed an additional million of the increase 
increased bad debt expenses related to higher natural gas costs in late and early and certain industrial customer bankruptcies in also contributed to higher operating expenses 
impairment charges and net loss on sale of assets in  we recorded an impairment charge of million on an unsecured note receivable from enron corporation that was written off following enron s december bankruptcy filing 
in addition  we wrote off million related to everest connections abandonment of certain communication system assets and related leases in markets it originally intended to develop 
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense increased million in compared to  primarily as the result of million of increased depreciation related to the assets acquired in the st 
joseph light power merger that occurred in december also contributing to the increase was million of depreciation on additional capital expenditures in our utility operations and million of additional depreciation resulting from our everest network build out 
equity in earnings of investments equity in earnings of investments decreased million in compared to  primarily due to reduced equity earnings from our investment in quanta services and the termination of our management fee agreement with quanta services in december our reduced equity earnings from quanta services stemmed from a slowdown in the telecom market and the write off of certain receivables from its telecom customers 
current operating developments quanta services ownership 
during we wrote our investment in quanta services down to fair value and sold approximately million of its shares which reduced our ownership from to 
as a result  we now account for this asset as a cost method security available for sale in future periods 
at december   our carrying value of this investment was million or a share 
we sold our remaining million shares during the first quarter of at a net price of a share 
everest connections 
during the fourth quarter of  we restricted future funding of everest to levels necessary to complete construction in progress and serve existing customers 
we evaluated the strategic alternatives for everest and chose to restructure the business so that going forward it is self funded from operations 
three year review international networks year ended december  dollars in millions sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses operating expense impairment charges and net loss on sale of assets depreciation and amortization expense total operating expenses other income expense equity in earnings of investments minority interest in income of subsidiaries gain on sale of subsidiary stock other income expense earnings loss before interest and taxes identifiable assets electric sales volumes gwh    canadian electric customers    versus sales  cost of sales and gross profit sales increased million in compared to  primarily due to a million rate increase in british columbia and a million interim rate increase in alberta 
offsetting the rate increases were the reduction in sales and cost of sales stemming from the sale of the alberta retail operations in january cost of sales decreased an additional million in due to the deferral of additional excess purchased power costs in alberta that regulatory authorities have now approved for recovery in future periods 
operating expense operating expense increased million in compared to this increase was primarily due to million of business development costs  million of costs associated with the integration of our british columbia and alberta operations  million of increased operating costs in our canadian networks and million of transition costs related to our midlands electricity acquisition 
impairment charges and net loss on sale of assets in  impairment charges mainly consisted of million related to our investment in midlands electricity in the uk and a million impairment charge related to our investments in multinet gas and alintagas in australia 
these impairments were determined based on the estimated fair value of these investments considering current market information  which included recent offers to sell our interest in these businesses  as well as corresponding impairment charges being taken in the financial statements of the underlying business 
equity in earnings of investments equity in earnings of investments increased million in compared to midlands  acquired in may  contributed million  excluding impairments  of the increase 
an additional million of the increase was due to goodwill no longer being amortized in the financial statements of our equity method investments 
gain on sale of subsidiary stock in october  through a public tender offer in new zealand  vector limited acquired all of the outstanding shares of unitednetworks limited unl  in which we had a indirect interest 
we realized a million pretax gain on the sale of this investment 
versus sales  cost of sales and gross profit sales and cost of sales for our international networks businesses decreased million and million  respectively  in compared to gross profit increased million in these changes were primarily due to the following the deconsolidation of our new zealand operations in june decreased sales  cost of sales and gross profit by million  million and million  respectively  but increased equity earnings as shown below 
our acquisition of transalta s electric distribution business in alberta  canada in august  and subsequent sale of its lower margin retail business in january  resulted in a decrease in sales and cost of sales of million and million  respectively 
this increased gross profit by million 
operating expense operating expense increased million in compared to the purchase of our alberta network increased operating expenses by million  while deconsolidating our new zealand business decreased operating expenses by million 
impairment charges and net loss on sale of assets in  we recorded charges of million relating to the realizability of deferred tax assets and interest receivable on shareholder loans in our australian equity investments 
equity in earnings of investments equity in earnings of investments increased million in compared to after the sale of a portion of our new zealand investment in june  we were required to deconsolidate this investment and use the equity method of accounting to record our share of earnings 
this increased equity earnings by million 
other income expense other income expense increased million  primarily reflecting the allowed recovery of carrying costs on deferred excess purchased power costs in alberta 
alberta regulators approved the recovery of carrying costs in december gain on sale of subsidiary stock we recorded a million gain when uel completed an initial public offering of of uecomm limited  its telecom business 
current operating developments united kingdom 
recent downgrades in credit ratings assigned to the public debt in the midlands ownership chain have called into question the ability of midlands to pay us management fees and dividends 
additionally  the local regulatory body  the office of gas and electricity markets ofgem  now requires pre approval of cash payments to the owners in the form of management fees or dividends 
accordingly  we intend to record equity earnings and management fees only to the extent of cash received 
in august  aquila and firstenergy initiated a process for the sale of midlands with final bids due in december we received offers in early december and are currently in negotiations with the prospective buyers 
australia 
we are currently exploring the possible sale of our investments in australia and anticipate a sale being completed in  however  there can be no assurances that this will occur 
canada 
in december  we filed for an annual rate increase in alberta of about million along with an application for a performance based rate setting mechanism 
we subsequently modified that request and sought a million increase for and a million increase for in july  an interim rate increase of approximately million was approved 
hearings were held in september and october and a final order was issued in february  resulting in a decrease in rates of million for  and no increase in rates in rates carried forward to 
almost all of the reduction in rates related to depreciation on distribution assets average asset lives were extended and the related income tax effect 
the decision did not adjust the allowed rate of return earned by the company and therefore  net income is not expected to be materially impacted by this decision 
however  the decision is estimated to reduce annual cash flow from operations by approximately million for and beyond 
with regard to  cash flow from operations will be reduced by approximately million  which includes the effect of both the and reduction 
as a result of the above action  we are currently reassessing the future recoverability of million of recorded goodwill in canada 
merchant services we conduct our merchant services business through aquila merchant services  inc aquila merchant  which operates as two business segments  capacity services and wholesale services 
capacity services primarily owns  operates and contractually controls our non regulated power generation assets 
wholesale services includes our north american and european commodity  client and capital businesses 
in and the first four months of  we owned of aquila merchant 
in april  approximately of aquila merchant was sold to the public 
for the remainder of  aquila merchant was consolidated with a minority interest reflected in the financial statements 
in january  we acquired the outstanding public shares of aquila merchant in an exchange offer and merger 
the following capacity services and wholesale services financial information includes of aquila merchant before minority interest  which totaled million for the year ended december  three year review capacity services year ended december  in millions sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses operating expense restructuring charges impairment charges and net loss on sale of assets depreciation and amortization expense total operating expenses other income expense equity in earnings of investments other income expense 
earnings loss before interest and taxes identifiable assets versus sales  cost of sales  and gross profit sales and cost of sales for our capacity services operations decreased million and million  respectively  in compared to  resulting in a decrease in gross profit of million 
these decreases were primarily due to the following factors decreases in electricity prices resulted in lower sales and cost of sales  and the lack of pricing volatility reduced the opportunities to optimize our assets with forward sales of power  both of which decreased gross profit in our power generation business relative to the mark to market gains of approximately million we recorded in in connection with our merchant power plants  we make fixed capacity payments evenly throughout the year 
for the year ended december   capacity payments increased by million when compared to as new plants became operational or were on line for a full year 
due to lower power prices in  this additional capacity was utilized on a limited basis at prices that were not sufficient to cover the fixed payments 
contract terminations due to counterparty creditworthiness generated losses of million in reduced demand for electricity driven by reduced liquidity in the market and over building of generation capacity has resulted in lower electricity prices and spark spreads the difference between the price at which electricity is sold and the cost of the fuel used to generate it which have substantially impacted our ability to economically operate our peaking generation plants 
operating expense operating expense increased million due to increased operating costs from additional power plants and gas storage coming on line 
this was partially offset by lower compensation expense resulting from the elimination of incentive compensation in restructuring charges in  we recorded restructuring charges of million relating to the termination of certain interest rate swaps associated with the construction financings for our clay county and piatt county power plants 
as debt related to these facilities was paid down earlier than anticipated  our swaps were in excess of our outstanding debt 
we therefore reduced our position and realized the loss associated with the cancelled portion of the unfavorable swap 
impairment charges and net loss on sale of assets impairment charges and net loss on sale of assets of million included million relating to the expected loss associated with either the sale or contract termination of four electric turbines that will be sold or returned to the manufacturer in  million related to our exit from the lodi gas storage investment  million related to fees and expenses associated with the termination of the cogentrix acquisition  million of goodwill that was impaired under sfas and million of other impairments 
equity in earnings of investments equity in earnings of investments increased million due to million of continued strong operating performance from various independent power projects and million of increased earnings resulting from the recovery of accounts receivable that were reserved for in versus sales  cost of sales and gross profit sales and cost of sales for our capacity services operations increased million and million  respectively  in compared to gross profit increased million 
these increases were primarily the result of the following factors the gpu international acquisition in december added approximately million to gross profit in while adding million and million to sales and cost of sales  respectively 
in  we sold power generation capacity at prices significantly above our operational cost  thus increasing sales  cost of sales and gross profit 
the additional sales and cost of sales are also the result of additional capacity brought on line 
operating expense operating expense increased million in compared to  primarily as the result of our gpu international acquisition in december depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense increased million in compared to  primarily as the result of our gpu international acquisition in december equity in earnings of investments equity earnings of investments increased million in compared to approximately million of this increase relates to the equity investments in four independent power plants that we added as part of our acquisition of gpu international in december merchant power capacity payments we have cash obligations under long term fixed capacity contracts that entitle us to generate power at power plants owned by others over the next years 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of these contracts 
due to reduced spark spreads and an oversupply of generation that are expected to continue in the foreseeable future  it is unlikely that we will be able to recover the million of capacity payments in using current forecasted spark spreads for  we expect to generate gross profit of approximately million before considering hedges and previous forward sales of million to offset these capacity payments 
these losses and cash outflows negatively impact our financial condition and liquidity position 
because resources are limited and these arrangements are inconsistent with our long term strategy  we are attempting to restructure or terminate certain of these contractual obligations on terms mutually acceptable to us and our counterparties 
the expected impact of our power capacity payments for are summarized below in millions annual capacity payments pretax income statement expected loss amount capacity payments exceed cash inflows earnings trend and impact of changing business environment the merchant energy sector has been negatively impacted by the increase in generation capacity that became operational in and by the continued construction of additional power plants over the next month horizon 
this increase in supply has placed downward pressure on power prices and subsequently the value of unsold merchant generation capacity 
as a result of the above factors and our change in strategy  we do not expect our capacity services unit to be profitable in the next to years 
we attempt to optimize and hedge our power plants with forward contracts which qualify as derivative instruments 
when we enter into these positions  they are accounted for at fair market value under mark to market accounting 
the hedges are an offset to our power plants  which use accrual accounting 
because different accounting rules are used on each side of the transaction  this can cause significant fluctuations in earnings with limited impacts on cash flow 
three year review wholesale services year ended december  in millions sales cost of sales gross profit loss operating expenses operating expense restructuring charges impairment charges and net loss on sale of assets depreciation and amortization expense total operating expenses other income expense equity in earnings of investments 
other income expense earnings loss before interest and taxes identifiable assets versus sales and gross profit sales and gross profit for our wholesale services operations decreased million and million  respectively  in compared to these decreases were primarily due to the following factors in the second quarter of  we announced that we were exiting the wholesale energy trading business 
therefore  we were not adding to our trading portfolio in the second half of and had limited opportunities for earnings 
gross profit in the last half of was million  compared to a loss of million in included in the million loss in the third and fourth quarters of  were gross margin losses of approximately million to balance counterparty positions  reduce open positions and terminate existing contracts as a result of our decision to exit the wholesale energy trading business 
our remaining margin losses that were incurred in the last six months of the year stem from unfavorable movements in credit  liquidity and interest reserves  unfavorable movements in trading positions  and unfavorable adjustments related to final settlements 
lack of price trends and lower volatility limited our opportunities to execute our trading strategy in the first half of  which reduced sales and gross profit by approximately million 
during the first six months of  price trends and high price volatility in the market provided the strongest two quarters in wholesale services history 
due to the rescission of eitf as previously discussed  our gains and losses from energy trading contracts are now required to be shown on a net basis 
to the extent losses exceeded gains  as was our case in  sales are shown as a negative number 
operating expense operating expense decreased million primarily due to the elimination of incentive compensation expense in and lower compensation expense due to staff reductions related to our exit of wholesale services 
restructuring charges in connection with the exit from our wholesale energy trading business in  we incurred million of restructuring charges 
these charges included million of severance and retention payments to terminated employees  million of excess leasehold improvements and equipment that were expensed when we vacated the related leased properties  million of lease costs connected to future lease commitments  million of losses associated with the exit from our retail aggregator loan business and million of other charges 
impairment charges and net loss on sale of assets impairment charges and net loss on sale of assets consisted primarily of an impairment charge of million related to goodwill associated with wholesale services that became unrealizable due to our exit from wholesale energy trading 
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense decreased million due to the elimination of goodwill amortization  the write off in of certain interactive web based assets and the restructuring charge on leasehold improvements and equipment that have now been fully expensed and therefore no longer subject to depreciation and amortization 
other income expense other income expense increased by million primarily due to a decrease in accounts receivable sale program fees due to the cancellation of the program in early and lower interest paid on customer margin deposits in versus sales and gross profit sales and cost of sales for our wholesale services operations increased million and decreased million  respectively  in compared to  while gross profit increased million in the same period 
these fluctuations were primarily due to the following a volatile pricing environment for gas and electricity  particularly in early  provided opportunities to profitably execute our trading strategies and increase sales of our risk management products and services to our clients 
electricity and gas volumes marketed in increased and  respectively  over  contributing to a combined increase on a total btu equivalent per day basis 
these increases  together with a increase in the number of commodity transactions executed  contributed to the increase in sales and gross profit 
in  we sold our merchant retail business  which caused sales and cost of sales to drop million and million  respectively  when compared to a increase in average gas prices also increased our sales 
a increase in the number of client transactions in compared to contributed to a increase in gross profit from our origination deals and from the more highly customized products we called client services 
these products included our guaranteedweather and guaranteedgeneration sm products as well as our longer duration gas and electric contracts 
operating expense operating expense increased million because our merchant business expanded during and our stronger performance in resulted in higher incentive compensation expense 
also impacting operating expenses was the allocation of million of expenses from corporate and other 
impairment charges and net loss on sale of assets impairment charges in included the write off of approximately million related to our trading exposures with enron 
while the million write off represents our best estimate of our exposure based on our contracts with enron  the ultimate outcome is subject to review by the bankruptcy courts 
earnings trend and impact of strategy change as previously stated  we began winding down and terminating our trading positions with our various counterparties during the third quarter of however  it will take a number of years to complete the wind down while we continue to deliver gas under our long term gas contracts 
because our trading book is predominantly hedged  we should experience little in the way of earnings or losses other than the impacts from counterparty credit  the discounting or accretion of interest  or the termination or liquidation of additional trading contracts 
however  there may be earnings volatility associated with the runoff of a portion of our trading book representing highly customized  actuarial based products 
these transactions are typically hedged using an actuarial approach similar to that used by the insurance industry and could have negative outcomes as book obligations settle over time 
as of december   we had ten contracts remaining in this portion of the portfolio  with the last contract expiring in using a long term value at risk methodology  with a confidence level  we would estimate million of total exposure potential losses through related to these contracts

total operating expenses other income expense equity in earnings of investments 

gain on sale of subsidiary stock other income expense earnings loss before interest and taxes identifiable assets versus restructuring charges restructuring charges in includes million of executive severance in connection with the separation agreements with our former chief executive officer and chief financial officer 
other income expense other income expense decreased million in when compared to included in was million of foreign exchange and interest rate losses relating to our original planned financing structure that was not consummated in connection with the midlands acquisition 
also impacting were million of foreign currency losses on inter company loans and million of write downs on certain technology related investments 
we also paid approximately million of fees in the fourth quarter of in connection with the waiver of a covenant default on several bank financing agreements 
in addition  in we allocated million of additional expense to our merchant business that had no effect on the consolidated results 
however  it was a favorable adjustment in that did not occur in interest expense interest expense and minority interest in income of partnership and trusts increased million in compared to interest expense was higher primarily as a result of the following the issuance of million of senior notes in february  interest on debt relating to the acquisition of our interest in midlands in may  and the issuance of million of senior notes in july these increases were offset in part by lower rates on variable rate short term and long term debt and the retirement of million of company obligated preferred securities in in addition  we retired million of company obligated preferred securities and million of other long term notes in june income tax expense benefit income taxes decreased million in compared to  primarily as a result of our loss before income taxes in as compared to record earnings in however  the expected income tax benefit was significantly reduced as a result of the following factors 
the tax benefit from a number of our asset sales or impairments generated substantial capital losses that were limited to available capital gains in the preceding three years and subsequent five years 
because capital gains within the carryback period were less than the loss and significant capital gains could not be assured in the foreseeable future  a million valuation allowance was established to offset our capital loss carryforward 
the million and million of impairment charges and asset sales related to wholesale services and capacity services goodwill  respectively  are considered a permanent difference between book and taxable income and does not result in the recognition of a tax benefit 
due to our need for capital and our change in business strategy to return the company back to a domestic regulated utility with some non regulated generation  we sold our new zealand investment  and we are in the process of exploring the sale of our australian  united kingdom  and canadian investments 
as a result  we can no longer represent that cash from our international investments will be permanently invested 
therefore  additional deferred tax was recorded to account for taxes that will arise when we bring asset sale proceeds back to the united states 
as a result  we recorded additional taxes of million in versus impairment charges and net loss on sale of assets in we recognized charges of million related to certain information technology assets that are no longer used in the business  and million related to our decision to discontinue use of certain corporate identity intangibles 
gain on sale of subsidiary stock in connection with the initial public offering of aquila merchant in april  we sold million of previously issued shares and realized a pretax gain of approximately million 
other income expense other income expense increased million primarily due to the allocation of million of expenses to our merchant business that had no effect on the consolidated results  but was a favorable corporate adjustment in interest expense interest expense and minority interests in income of partnership and trusts increased million in compared to this was primarily due to increased long term borrowings in late and early related to the acquisitions of our alberta network  alintagas  st 
joseph light power and gpu international 
income tax expense income taxes increased million in compared to this was primarily due to the increased earnings before income taxes in resulting from the factors previously discussed 
our overall effective tax rate increased from in to in the increase in our effective tax rate was due primarily to the effect of increased minority interest in income of subsidiaries  taxes on the gain recognized on the sale of our shares in aquila merchant  and valuation allowances on certain international losses

as discussed below  while we believe these financial statements include the most likely outcomes with regard to amounts that are based on our judgments and estimates  our financial position and results of operations may be materially different when reported under different conditions or when using different assumptions in the application of such policies 
in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual amounts  adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information 
our critical accounting policies include sales recognition 
the portion of our sales related to our trading activities that qualify as derivatives under sfas is recorded under the mark to market method of accounting 
the market prices or fair values used in determining the value of our portfolio are our best estimates utilizing information such as closing exchange rates  over the counter quotes  historical volatility and the potential impact on market prices of liquidating our positions in an orderly manner over a reasonable period of time under current market conditions 
as additional information becomes available  or actual amounts are determinable  the recorded estimates are revised 
as a result  operating results can be affected by revisions to prior accounting estimates 
unbilled utility revenues 
sales related to the delivery of energy are generally recorded when service is rendered  or energy is delivered to customers 
however  the determination of sales is based on reading customers meters  which occurs systematically throughout the month 
at the end of each month  an estimate is made of the amount of energy delivered to the customer after the date of the last meter reading and recorded as unbilled revenue 
the unbilled revenue is calculated each month based on estimated customer usage  weather factors  line losses and applicable customer rates 
impairment of long lived assets 
we review the carrying value of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying values may not be recoverable in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
unforeseen events and changes in conditions could indicate that these carrying values may not be recoverable and result in impairment charges 
an impairment loss is recognized only if the carrying amount of the long lived asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds its future undiscounted cash flows 
once deemed impaired  the long lived asset is written down to its fair value  which could be considerably less than the carrying amount of future undiscounted cash flows 
the determination of future cash flows  and  if required  fair value of a long lived asset is by its nature  a highly subjective judgment 
fair value is generally determined by calculating the discounted future cash flows using a discount rate based upon our weighted average cost of capital 
significant judgments and assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the long term estimated cash flows  including long term forecasts of the amounts and timing of overall market growth 
changes in these estimates could have a material effect on the assessment of our long lived assets 
investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries 
we account for our equity investments in accordance with accounting principles board no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock apb 
apb states that a loss in value which is considered other than temporary should be recognized 
apb states that if the current fair value of an investment is less than its carrying amount  this may indicate an other than temporary loss in the value of the investment 
as discussed above  determining fair market value is highly subjective  requiring significant judgments and assumptions 
changes in estimates could have a material effect on the assessment of our equity investments 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
under sfas we no longer amortize goodwill  but instead test it for impairment each year on november  and if impaired  write it off against earnings at that time 
other intangibles are to be tested for impairment in accordance with sfas as discussed above 
goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit  determined on a discounted cash flow basis or other fair market value methods  with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then an impairment loss is measured by comparing the implied goodwill excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value assigned to its assets and liabilities with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
we believe that the accounting estimate related to determining the fair value of goodwill  and thus any impairment  is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period to period because it requires us to make cash flow assumptions about future sales  operating costs and discount rates over an indefinite life  and the impact of recognizing an impairment could be material 
management s assumptions about future sales margins and volumes require significant judgment because actual margins and volumes have fluctuated in the past and are expected to continue to do so 
in estimating future margins and expenses  we use our internal budgets 
we develop our budgets based on anticipated customer growth  rate cases  inflation and weather trends 
regulatory accounting implications 
we currently record the economic effects of regulation in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation sfas 
accordingly  our balance sheet reflects certain costs as regulatory assets 
we expect our rates will continue to be based on historical costs for the foreseeable future 
however  if we no longer qualified for treatment under sfas  we would make adjustments to the carrying value of our regulatory assets and liabilities and would be required to recognize them in current period earnings 
total net regulatory assets at december  were million  including deferred purchased power costs of million related to our alberta  canada electricity business 
valuation of deferred tax assets 
we are required to assess the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets generated from capital losses incurred on the sale of assets 
this assessment takes into consideration tax planning strategies within our control  including assumptions regarding the availability and character of future taxable income 
at december   we have recorded million of valuation allowances against deferred tax assets for which the ultimate realization of the tax asset is mainly dependent on the availability of future capital gains 
the ultimate amount of deferred tax assets realized could be materially different from those recorded  as impacted by political changes in federal income tax laws and upon the actual realization of the related tax assets 
pension plans 
our reported costs of providing non contributory defined pension benefits described in note to the consolidated financial statements are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience 
pension costs  for example  are impacted by actual employee demographics including age  compensation levels and employment periods  the level of contributions we make to the plan and earnings on plan assets 
changes made to the provisions of the plan may also impact current and future pension costs 
pension costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions  including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension costs 
pension plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments 
fluctuations in actual equity market returns as well as changes in general interest rates may result in increased or decreased pension costs in future periods 
likewise  changes in assumptions regarding current discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets could also increase or decrease recorded pension costs 
as of september   our average assumed discount rate was and our average expected return on plan assets was 
the following chart reflects the sensitivities associated with a change in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage 
while the chart below reflects an increase or decrease in the percentage for each assumption  we and our actuaries expect that the inverse of this change would impact the projected benefit obligation pbo at december   and our estimated annual pension cost apc on the income statement for by a similar amount in the opposite direction 
each sensitivity below reflects an evaluation of the change based solely on a change in that assumption

rate of return on plan assets 

liquidity and capital resources overall we are currently operating in a business environment that has substantially limited our ability to raise incremental capital through the bank and capital markets 
as of march   we had million of unrestricted cash on hand  no available capacity under our current revolver and the following short term debt  net of any collateral held in millions debt outstanding at december  debt outstanding at march  cash collateral held at march  net amount outstanding at march  short term debt revolving credit facility united states a b turbine facility a bank borrowings and other canada subtotal current maturities of long term debt clay county project notes a piatt county project notes a canadian denominated credit facilities a australian notes d canadian asset securitization c miscellaneous subtotal total a amount repaid in full concurrent with new financings described below 
b we have cash collateral held by our revolving credit banks of million as of march   which collateralizes million of letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility 
c this facility is secured by certain future rate collections and will be repaid monthly through february d amount repaid in full in april on april   we closed on a three year senior secured financing of million and a day senior secured financing of million 
the day financing also includes an option under which we can  during a day period following closing  at our discretion  increase the size of the financing by up to million 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the terms of the financings 
proceeds from the financings will be used to retire debt and support existing and future letters of credit 
the secured financings will eliminate the covenant violations stated below 
with the above financings  we believe we will have sufficient liquidity to cover our operational needs through june our next significant need for outside capital relates to our need to retire senior notes maturing in we anticipate retiring these notes with proceeds from additional asset sales 
in the event we are not successful in closing the asset sales  we would need to obtain a bridge loan to meet these obligations 
although no assurance can be given on the above actions  we expect to be successful in their execution 
financing and debt covenants on april   we entered into a new revolving credit facility totaling million that replaced a million credit facility 
the new credit facility consisted of two million agreements  one with a maturity date of days  the other three years 
at december   we had million of revolving bank loan borrowings outstanding and million of letters of credit issued against the facility 
as explained in note of the consolidated financial statements  we received waivers in the third quarter from lenders under our revolving credit facilities and other credit arrangements from the requirement that we maintain a certain interest coverage ratio 
in exchange  we agreed to use a portion of the proceeds we received from certain asset sales to reduce our obligations to those lenders 
such prepayments on our revolving credit agreements reduced  on a dollar for dollar basis  the lenders commitment to extend credit to us under those agreements 
as of december   we made payments of approximately million against our revolver that in turn reduced our maximum borrowing limits to million and established a cash collateral balance of million against our letters of credit 
between december  and march   we made additional payments from asset sale proceeds of million  further reducing our borrowing capacity to million and increasing our cash collateral balance to million 
in april  debt outstanding under the day credit facility was repaid in full and the unutilized portion of the three year credit facility was terminated 
the utilized portion of this facility is only being used as support for our letters of credit currently outstanding 
the lenders have agreed to a allow the letters of credit that are fully cash collateralized under the three year credit facility and  thus  the facility itself to remain outstanding and b waive certain restrictions for an additional three week period 
during the next three weeks  the company intends to replace the letters of credit issued under the three year facility with new letters of credit under a different credit facility that will be fully cash collateralized 
asset sales program earlier this year we initiated an extensive asset sales program to enhance our liquidity and  in light of our change in business strategy  dispose of non core assets 
following is a table of asset sales completed during in millions gross proceeds gas gathering and pipeline assets lockport energy unitednetworks uk gas storage quanta services investment gas storage facility merchant loan portfolio other assets total  suspension of dividend in november  the board of directors suspended the annual dividend on our common stock for an undetermined time 
this decision stems from a detailed analysis of our current financial condition  its liquidity forecast and its earnings prospects after completion of the asset sales program discussed above 
based on this analysis  the board of directors decided that the most prudent course of action was to suspend the dividend until our financial condition and stability is clarified 
at this time we cannot predict when or if the board of directors will reinstate the dividend or  if reinstated  what the annualized dividend rate will be in the future 
our three year senior secured credit facility described in note to the consolidated financial statements prohibits us from paying dividends if our senior unsecured debt is not rated at least ba by moody s and bb by s p 
current credit ratings credit ratings impact our ability to obtain short and long term financing  the cost of such financing and the execution of our commercial strategies 
our financial flexibility is limited because of restrictive covenants and other terms that are typically imposed on non investment grade borrowers 
as of april   our senior unsecured long term debt ratings  as assessed by the three major credit rating agencies  were as follows agency rating commentary moody s investors service moody s caa negative outlook standard poor s corporation s p b negative outlook fitch ratings fitch b negative outlook during  moody s lowered our credit rating from investment grade of baa to ba negative outlook  a non investment grade 
additionally  s p downgraded us to bb  a non investment grade rating  from bbb  with a negative outlook and fitch downgraded us to bb  from bbb  with a negative outlook 
in  moody s further downgraded us to caa and fitch and s p downgraded us to b and b  respectively 
as a result of these downgrades  we were required to post additional collateral to support certain loan and operating contracts discussed below 
ratings triggers we do not have any trigger events eg  an acceleration of repayment of outstanding indebtedness  an increase in interest costs or the posting of cash collateral tied to our stock price and have not executed any transactions that require us to issue equity based on our credit ratings or other trigger events 
certain of our subsidiaries have trigger events tied to specified credit ratings 
because of guarantee and cross default provisions between aquila  inc and these subsidiaries  the ratings triggers of our subsidiaries discussed below should be viewed as if they are directly applicable to aquila  inc in  we retired million of our australian denominated notes that were put to us after the credit downgrades 
our australian subsidiaries have three other outstanding series of australian denominated notes totaling million at december  the holders of million of these notes exercised their put rights and were repaid in january the remaining notes totaling million were repaid in april aquila merchant also has three tolling agreements  a construction loan and certain margining agreements that have trigger events tied to aquila s credit ratings 
under the tolling agreements  our subsidiary uses a third party s generation assets to convert fuel into electric power for its subsequent resale 
as of march   we have posted collateral due to our downgrades by moody s and s p of million related to the tolling agreements  million related to the construction loan  and million related to standard margining agreements 
other potential demands for collateral due to downgrades although we have substantially exited the wholesale energy trading business of aquila merchant  a number of energy trading agreements remain to be settled or liquidated 
these contracts consist of various long term gas contracts  forward purchases and sales of gas and electricity  weather derivatives  alternative risk contracts  coal and other commodity trading contracts that are difficult to liquidate 
these contracts typically include provisions that allow counterparties to request additional collateral to support underlying transactions if events occur that cause counterparties to believe that there has been deterioration in our creditworthiness 
as a result of the downgrades  we provided collateral to certain counterparties in the form of cash deposits or letters of credit totaling million through march  while it is difficult to predict how many additional parties may successfully demand some form of collateral  we currently estimate that the amount of additional cash collateral if s p or moody s were to downgrade us further would be minimal 
the following table summarizes the collateral posted or debt repaid due to credit downgrades through march   and additional collateral or debt that may be required to be posted or repaid in the future in millions potential amount amounts posted paid to date australian denominated bonds tolling agreements construction loan standard margining agreements other collateral demands total in addition to collateral calls made due to credit downgrades  fluctuations in commodity prices can also cause both significant inflows and outflows of collateral 
this will vary depending on the magnitude of the price movement and the current position of our portfolio 
contractual obligations long term gas contracts our obligations under our long term gas delivery contracts that were paid to us in advance  will result in cash outflows and losses as outlined in the table below 
we are committed to meeting these obligations 
in millions long term gas contract settlement long term gas contract margin loss total long term gas contract cash payments thereafter total  this represents the reduction of long term gas contracts each period 
this represents the loss that is reflected as a reduction to gross margin each period 
this represents the cash payment obligation to purchase the gas delivered to the municipal utilities each period 
we accounted for the cash payments in advance related to these contracts as long term obligations 
we recognize the relief of our obligation for these long term gas contracts as the gas is delivered to the customer under the units of revenue method 
if we were to default on these obligations  or were unable to perform on them  we may be asked to pay the issuers of the surety bonds on these arrangements an amount that is greater than the long term gas contract balance on our consolidated balance sheet 
as of december   our best estimate of this additional amount ranges from million to million  depending on the discount rate used 
this difference arises due to our use of the units of revenue method of relieving the long term obligation versus a present value method that would likely be used by the sureties 
merchant power plant capacity obligations our scheduled capacity payments for power generation in our capacity services business during aggregate approximately million 
because it is generally expected that the fuel and start up costs of operating merchant power plants will exceed the revenues that would be generated from the power sales  we believe that our capacity to generate power will largely be unutilized 
if our tolling agreements that comprise a substantial portion of our capacity payments are not terminated or restructured on terms acceptable to our counterparties and us  our earnings and liquidity will be severely impacted 
we have communicated to certain counterparties the necessity that these agreements be terminated or restructured 
in millions capacity payments thereafter  total  other obligations we also have contractual cash obligations including maturities of long term debt  minimum payments on operating leases and regulated power  gas and coal purchase contracts 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these obligations 
the amounts of contractual cash obligations maturing in each of the next five years and thereafter are shown below in millions thereafter total long term debt obligations operating leases obligations merchant gas transportation obligations regulated purchase obligations total  capital expenditures we estimate future cash requirements for capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment additions will be as follows actual future cash requirements in millions domestic utilities everest connections canadian utilities merchant services 

corporate and other total capital expenditures legal proceeding on february   we filed a suit against chubb insurance group  the issuer of surety bonds in support of certain of our long term gas contracts 
previously  chubb had demanded that it be released from its surety obligation of up to million or  alternatively  that we provide collateral to secure its obligation 
we do not believe that chubb is entitled to be released from its surety obligations or that we are obligated to provide collateral to secure its obligations unless it is likely we will default on the contracts 
chubb has not alleged that we are likely to default on the contracts 
if chubb were to prevail  it would have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial position 
we rely on other sureties in support of long term gas supply contracts similar to those described above 
there can be no assurance that these sureties will not make claims similar to those raised by chubb 
we have performed under these contracts since their inception and intend to continue to fully perform on the contracts 
cash flows cash flows from operating activities cash flows from operating activities were significantly lower in compared to  primarily due to net losses in and the termination of our accounts receivable sales programs 
also impacting cash flows from operating activities was the payment of higher annual and long term incentive compensation based on the record earnings in in addition  we made payments of million to our defined benefit pension plans to offset declines in plan asset values due to market performance 
partially offsetting decreased cash flows in were cash collections related to price risk management assets 
cash flows from investing activities cash flows used for investing activities included increased capital expenditures for utility plant additions and merchant power generation construction 
in addition  the acquisition of our interest in midlands electricity in may increased cash used for investing activities 
offsetting these cash flows was billion of cash received on the sale of assets and a reduction in merchant capital expenditures 
cash flows from financing activities cash flows from financing activities came primarily from our issuance of common stock and senior notes 
in january  we issued million shares of our common stock to the public  which raised approximately million in net proceeds 
we also sold million of senior notes due in march the issuance of million common shares and million of senior notes in july raised approximately million 
we used the proceeds of these issuances primarily to replace the liquidity formerly provided by the accounts receivables sale programs and to retire debt and preferred securities 
significant balance sheet movements total assets decreased billion in compared to this decrease is primarily due to the following cash increased million 
see our consolidated statements of cash flows for analysis of the increase 
restricted cash increased million partially due to the escrow of million of proceeds from our sale of our merchant loan portfolio in december  cash collateral posted in relation to the turbine facility and the clay county power plant and the segregation of cash deposited with us by one of our counterparties  which was done at the counterparties request 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of these transactions 
funds on deposit increased million due to increased commodity prices and an increase in margin deposits due to the downgrades of our credit ratings 
accounts receivable decreased by billion primarily due to our exit from the wholesale energy trading business  partially offset by increased commodity prices in inventories and supplies decreased million primarily due to the sell down of our gas storage inventory in due to the exit from our wholesale services business 
price risk management assets  current and non current  decreased million primarily due to the collection of approximately million of current contracts outstanding at december  and the liquidation of wholesale energy trading contracts stemming from our exit of that business  partially offset by higher forward pricing of natural gas and electricity 
prepayments and other increased million  primarily due to an income tax receivables amount of million resulting from current year losses and million of additional funding to our pension plan  partially offset by a decrease in power and coal options premiums due to the exit from our energy trading business as well as cash collateral that has been released 
a million increase in property  plant and equipment  net  resulted primarily from the accounting consolidation of the clay county and piatt county power plants and fixed asset additions in the current year  partially offset by asset sales and impairments 
a billion decrease in investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries is primarily due to the million impairment of our investment in quanta services  the million write down of our australia investments and the sale of our million investment in unitednetworks limited 
deferred charges and other assets decreased million  primarily due to deferred purchased power costs reclassified to current as the current portion was collected through rates  and cash collateral on the clay county power plant lease that was reclassified into restricted cash 
non current assets of discontinued operations decreased billion due to asset sales in in  total liabilities decreased by billion  while company obligated preferred securities decreased by million and common shareholders equity decreased million 
these changes were primarily due to the following short term debt decreased million primarily due to the repayment of short term borrowings using proceeds from equity offerings  long term debt offerings and asset sales 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
accounts payable decreased by billion primarily due to our exit from the wholesale energy trading business  partially offset by an increase in prices from december  accrued liabilities decreased by million primarily due to the payment of accrued annual and long term incentives that were based on record earnings in and lower accrued taxes due to current period losses  partially offset by increased accrued interest due to our non investment grade credit rating 
price risk management liabilities  current and non current  increased million primarily due to higher forward pricing of natural gas 
current and long term gas contracts decreased million due to current year deliveries on these contracts 
customer funds on deposit increased million primarily due to an increase in commodity prices and lower counterparty credit ratings  which resulted in additional margin deposits received 
long term debt  including current maturities  increased by million primarily due to the issuance of million of senior notes in february  million of senior notes in july  the accounting consolidation of the clay county and piatt county debt  partially offset by the pay down of certain new zealand and australian notes and million of current maturities of company obligated preferred securities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
deferred income taxes and credits increased million primarily due to the removal of our permanent investment election relating to our international investments see note in our consolidated financial statements  partially offset by deferred taxes recognized in due to asset sales 
minority interest decreased million primarily due to the exchange offer by which we acquired the minority interest in aquila merchant services that was owned by the public 
company obligated preferred securities decreased net million due to these securities being converted to common stock 
common shareholders equity decreased million primarily as a result of the  million net loss in and the million of dividends declared  partially offset by the issuance of million shares of our stock in the merchant services exchange offer and the million and million shares of our stock issued in january and july  respectively

forward looking information and risk factors this report contains forward looking information  including statements that i our hedging activities will minimize losses in our remaining trading portfolio  ii significant amounts of cash collateral provided to counterparties will be returned to us  iii our long term liquidity plan calls for sales of international assets  the restructuring of generation capacity obligations and refinancing of maturing debt and iv we do not believe that pending litigation or governmental investigations will result in outcome that is materially adverse to us 
the words may  will  should  expect  anticipate  intend  plan  believe  seek  estimate  or the negative of these terms or similar expressions identify further forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties  and there are certain important factors that can cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
some of the important factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated include counterparties may default on their obligations to return collateral to us or to meet their obligations under commercial contracts  including those designed to hedge against movements in commodity prices 
our credit ratings and financial condition will limit our ability to access the capital markets we historically used to refinance our debt 
because we recently pledged a significant portion of our assets as collateral for loans  it will be difficult for us to obtain additional unsecured financing 
we must obtain regulatory approvals to use the majority of our remaining unencumbered assets as collateral for additional loans 
if our financial condition improves in the short term  the market prices for our long term debt may increase and limit our ability to repurchase it 
our new credit agreements require us to use a significant portion of the proceeds from the sale of our assets to reduce our obligations to those lenders before retiring more expensive debt 
because of the location and significant size of our australian investment  there are a limited number of potential purchasers of these assets 
because we are a minority owner  other investors must agree to any sale that we support 
our commitments under long term gas delivery contracts and capacity generation contracts will generate significant losses and negative cash flows for an extended period of time 
because these obligations represent favorable contracts to the counterparties  absent a risk of our default  they may be unwilling to restructure or sell the contracts 
there are numerous ongoing state and federal investigations of the trading activities of companies that participated in the energy trading industry  including us 
companies that have violated laws or rules of the investigating agencies have been required to pay significant fines 
even if no wrongdoing is found  we could incur substantial legal and accounting costs associated with complying with the discovery requests of the investigating body 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk trading we are exposed to market risk  including changes in commodity prices  interest rates and currency exchange rates 
to manage the volatility relating to these exposures  we enter into various derivative transactions in accordance with our policy approved by the board of directors 
our trading portfolios consist of natural gas  electricity  coal  global liquids  weather derivatives and interest rate contracts that are settled by the delivery of the commodity or cash 
these contracts take many forms  including futures  forwards  swaps and options 
as we are winding down our trading portfolio  many of these risks have been significantly reduced as the majority of our positions are hedged 
we measure the risk in our trading portfolio using a value at risk methodology 
the value at risk calculation utilizes statistics to determine the relationship between the size of a potential loss and the probability of its occurrence  from holding an individual instrument or portfolio of instruments for a given period of time 
the quantification of market risk using value at risk methodologies provides a consistent measure of risk across diverse energy markets and products and is considered a best practice standard for this application 
the use of this methodology requires a number of key assumptions  including selection of a confidence level we use  holding period this is the time needed to liquidate a position we use one day  and use of historical volatility and correlations with the most recent activity weighted more heavily 
the average value at risk for all commodities during the first six months of was million  million during the second half of the year and million for the full year 
the million value at risk limit approved by the board of directors has been revised downward at various times during by our risk management committee and is currently limited to million for the remaining trading portfolio and a million target for the aggregate book that includes the first months of capacity services asset positions 
in addition to value at risk  we also apply other risk control measures that incorporate volumetric limits by commodity  loss limits  durational limits and we perform stress testing to our various risk portfolios 
all merchant interest and foreign currency risks are monitored within the commodity portfolios and value at risk calculation 
the merchant commodity portfolios are valued on a mark to market basis that requires that the trading book be discounted on a net present value basis utilizing current interest rates 
because interest rate movements impact the value of our trading portfolio  we actively hedge our interest rate exposures to limit these fluctuations 
the table below shows the expected net cash flows associated with the interest rate financial instruments related to our trading portfolio at december  dollars in millions variable to fixed rate average rate paid average rate received certain trading activities we engage in price risk management activities for both trading and non trading activities 
transactions carried out in connection with trading activities that are derivatives under sfas are accounted for under the mark to market method of accounting 
through october  these contracts were accounted for under eitf which also required the use of the mark to market method 
under sfas  our energy commodity trading contracts  including physical transactions mainly gas and power and financial instruments  are recorded at fair value 
as part of the valuation of our portfolio  we value the credit risks associated with the financial condition of counterparties and the time value of money 
we primarily use quoted market prices from published sources or comparable transactions in liquid markets to value our contracts 
if actively quoted market prices are not available  we contact brokers and other external sources or use comparable transactions to obtain current values of our contracts 
in addition  the market prices or fair values used in determining the value of the portfolio are our best estimates utilizing information such as historical volatility  time value  counterparty credit and the potential impact on market prices of liquidating our positions in an orderly manner over a reasonable period of time under current market conditions 
when market prices are not readily available or determinable  certain contracts are recorded at fair value using an alternative approach such as model pricing 
the changes in fair value of our trading and other contracts for are summarized below in millions wholesale services capacity services total fair value at december  reduction in fair value during the year contracts realized or cash settled entered into in contracts realized or cash settled entered into in prior years fair value at december  the fair value of contracts maturing in each of the next four years and thereafter are shown below in millions thereafter a total wholesale services prices actively quoted prices provided by other external sources priced based on models and other valuation methods fair value of contracts capacity services prices actively quoted prices provided by other external sources priced based on models and other valuation methods fair value of contracts net price risk management assets a as these contracts have been significantly hedged  movement in commodity prices will have limited impact on the net value provided 
credit risk in conducting our network  energy marketing and risk management activities  we regularly transact business with a broad range of entities and a wide variety of end users  energy merchants  producers and financial institutions 
credit risk is measured by the loss we would record if our counterparties failed to perform pursuant to the terms of their contractual obligations less the value of any collateral held 
we have established policies  systems and controls to manage our exposure to credit risk 
this infrastructure allows us to assess counterparty creditworthiness  monitor credit exposures  stress test the portfolio to quantify future potential credit exposures and catalogue collateral received by the company 
in addition  to enhance the ongoing management of credit exposure  we have used master netting agreements whenever possible 
master netting agreements enable us to net certain assets and liabilities by counterparty 
in situations where the credit quality of counterparties have deteriorated to certain levels  we will assert any contractual rights that allow us to secure our exposures by requesting collateral against these obligations 
a natural result from our prior business strategy is the concentration of energy sector credit risk 
factors affecting this industry segment will affect the general credit quality of our aggregate portfolio both positively and negatively 
the result of energy industry downgrades of certain companies with significant energy merchant activity has reduced the overall credit quality of our exposures in general 
the following table details our credit exposures at december   associated with our forward positions within our trading portfolio and our billed receivables excluding residential customers  netted by counterparty where master netting agreements exist and by collateral to the extent any is held 
in millions investment grade non investment grade total utilities and merchants financial institutions oil and gas producers commercial industrial total  our credit exposure will diminish significantly in april and april as contracts expire and the winter season concludes 
currency rate exposure we do not currently hedge our net investment in foreign operations 
as a result  our foreign denominated assets and liabilities will fluctuate in value 
historically  our net exposure to changes in foreign currency has been limited as our foreign investments have been financed largely through the local currency 
however  as a result of our recent credit downgrades and debt maturities  we have been required to repay certain foreign debt with other than local currency 
we hedge the earnings of our foreign operations through financial put transactions 
on average  we hedge of our annual expected earnings from foreign operations 
to the extent that foreign currency dollars change in value against the us dollar in countries in which we operate  the foreign currency put will offset the majority of this change 
the table below summarizes the average value of foreign currencies used to value sales and expenses along with the related sensitivity
