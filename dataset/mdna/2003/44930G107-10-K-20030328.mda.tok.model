item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we develop  manufacture  sell and distribute disposable medical connection products 
our principal products are proprietary safe medical connection devices for use in iv therapy applications 
we also produce custom iv systems that incorporate our proprietary products  and since october   blood collection needles 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in preparing our financial statements  we make estimates and assumptions that affect the expected amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we apply our accounting policies on a consistent basis 
as circumstances change  they are considered in our estimates and judgments  and future changes in circumstances could result in changes in amounts at which assets and liabilities are recorded 
investment securities are all marketable and considered available for sale 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk under our current investment policies  the securities in which we invest have no significant difference between cost and fair value 
if our investment policies were to change  and there were differences between cost and fair value  that difference  net of tax effect  would be reflected as a separate component of stockholders equity 
most of our product sales are fob shipping point and ownership of the product transfers to the customer when we ship it 
certain other product sales are fob destination and ownership of the product transfers to the customer at destination 
we record sales and related costs when ownership of the product transfers to the customer 
most of our customers are distributors or medical product manufacturers  although there are some sales to end users 
our only post sale obligations are warranty and certain rebates 
customers  with certain rare exceptions  do not retain any right of return and there is no price protection with respect to unsold products 
we warrant products against defects and have a policy permitting the return of defective products 
we provide a reserve for warranty returns as an expense  amounts have been insignificant 
we accrue rebates as a reduction in revenue based on contractual commitments and historical experience  amounts have not been significant 
adjustments of estimates of warranty claims  rebates or returns  which have not been  and are not expected to be material  affect current operating results when they are made 
accounts receivable are stated at net realizable value 
an allowance is provided for estimated collection losses based on specific past due accounts for which we consider collection to be doubtful 
loss exposure is principally with international distributors for whom normal payment terms are long in comparison to those of our other customers and  to a lesser extent  domestic distributors 
many of these distributors are relatively small and we are vulnerable to adverse developments in their businesses that can hinder our collection of amounts due 
if there are significant doubts as to the collectibility of receivables at the time of shipment  we defer recognition of the sale in income until the receivable is collected 
if actual collection losses exceed expectations  we could be required to accrue additional bad debt expense  which could have an adverse effect on our operating results in the period in which the accrual occurs 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
we need to carry many components to accommodate our rapid product delivery  and if we misestimate demand or if customer requirements change  we may have components in inventory that we may not be able to use 
most finished products are made only after we receive orders  but for those that are not  we need to estimate what may not be saleable 
we regularly review inventory for slow moving items and write off all items we do not expect to use in manufacturing  or finished products we do not expect to sell 
if actual usage of components or sales of finished goods inventory is less than our estimates  we would be required to write off additional inventory  which could have an adverse effect on our operating results in the period in which the write off occurs 
property and equipment is carried at cost and depreciated on the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
the estimates of useful lives are significant judgments in accounting for property and equipment  particularly for molds and automated assembly machines that are custom made for us 
we may retire them on an accelerated basis if we replace them with larger or more technologically advanced tooling 
the remaining useful lives of all property and equipment are reviewed regularly and lives are adjusted or assets written off based on current estimates of future use 
as part of that review  property and equipment is reviewed for other indicators of impairment  but to date we have not encountered circumstances indicating the carrying amount of an asset  or group of assets  may not be recoverable 
an unexpected shortening of useful lives of property and equipment that significantly increases depreciation provisions  or other circumstances causing us to record an impairment loss on such assets  could have an adverse effect on our operating results in the period in which the related charges are recorded 
new accounting pronouncements we have implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact our consolidated financial statements and do not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
overview our principal products through are our clave needleless iv connection system and our custom iv systems 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  net revenues by product as a percentage of total net revenues product line clave custom iv systems clc punctur guard lopez valve rf rf rhino protected needle and other products license  royalty and revenue share total we sell our products to independent distributors and through agreements with abbott the abbott agreements and certain other medical product manufacturers 
most independent distributors handle the full line of our products 
abbott purchases clave products  principally bulk  non sterile connectors 
abbott also purchases the rhino  a low priced connector specifically designed for abbott  the clc  and custom iv sets 
we also sell certain other products to a number of other medical product manufacturers 
the abbott agreements extend to december and have extension provisions beyond that date 
the b 
braun agreement for clave terminated on december  we believe that as the healthcare provider market continues to consolidate  our success in marketing and distributing clave products will depend  in part  on our ability  either independently or through strategic supply and distribution arrangements  to secure long term clave contracts with major buying organizations 
further  our marketing and distribution strategy may result in a significant share of our revenues being concentrated among a small number of distributors and manufacturers 
the loss of a strategic supply and distribution agreement with a customer or the loss of a large contract by such a customer could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
we believe the success of the clave has  and will continue to  motivate others to develop one piece needleless connectors that may incorporate many of the same functional and physical characteristics as the clave 
we are aware of a number of such products 
in response to competitive pressure  we have been reducing prices to protect and expand our market 
the price reductions to date have been more than offset by increased volume 
we expect that the average price of our clave products may continue to decline 
there is no assurance that our current or future products will be able to successfully compete with products developed by others 
the federal needlestick safety and prevention act  enacted in november  modified standards promulgated by the occupational safety and health administration to require employers to use needleless systems where appropriate to reduce risk of injury to employees from needlesticks 
we believe the effect of this law will be to accelerate sales of our needleless systems  although we are unable to estimate the amount or timing of such sales 
we are taking steps to reduce our dependence on our current proprietary products 
we are seeking to substantially expand our custom iv systems business with products sold to medical product manufacturers and independent distributors 
under our february  agreement with abbott we manufacture all new custom iv sets for sale by abbott and jointly promote the products under the name setsource 
we expect continuing significant increases in sales of custom iv systems under this agreement 
we also launched efforts to contract with group purchasing organizations and independent dealer networks for inclusion of our products among those available to members of those entities 
there is no assurance that either one of these initiatives will continue to succeed 
we have an ongoing program to increase systems capabilities  improve manufacturing efficiency  reduce labor costs  reduce time needed to produce an order  and minimize investment in inventory 
the original focus was on production of custom iv systems  which is relatively labor intensive  it now includes all automated manufacturing operations as well 
manual assembly is now performed at the facility opened in december in ensenada  baja california  mexico 
in  we made significant investment in automated molding and assembly equipment 
in the third quarter of  we commenced use of automated assembly equipment for the o valve and commenced use of automated assembly equipment for the clc in the fourth quarter of throughout we added molding and automated assembly capacity for clave production and in the third quarter of commenced a significant expansion of our manual assembly capacity in mexico that we expect to complete in early all these steps have reduced and will continue to reduce unit production costs 
ongoing steps also include automation of the production of new products and other products for which volume is growing  and consideration of establishment of production facilities outside north america 
because significant innovation is required to achieve these goals  there is no assurance that these steps will achieve the desired results 
we distribute products through three distribution channels 
net revenues for each distribution channel  including license  royalty and revenue share were as follows channel medical product manufacturers independent domestic distributors international total the healthcare business in the united states is subject to seasonal fluctuations  and activity tends to diminish somewhat in the summer months of june  july and august  when illness is less frequent than in winter months and patients tend to postpone elective procedures 
this typically causes seasonal fluctuations in our business 
in addition  we can experience fluctuations as a result of variations in the ordering patterns of our largest customers  which may be driven more by production scheduling and their inventory levels  and less by seasonality 
at december   we had orders for current delivery of approximately million 
of that amount  approximately million could have been shipped to abbott in the fourth quarter of  but shipment was deferred until early by agreement with abbott 
comparison of to in  we had net revenues of  which was  or  higher than the net revenues of  reported in the increase was primarily attributable to the increase in sales of clave products  which increased by  and custom iv systems  which increased  net sales to abbott were  in  compared to  in clave sales to abbott increased to  from  principally because of an increase in unit volume 
sales of custom iv systems to abbott under the setsource program approximated  for the year  up from  in  the year the program was initiated 
we expect a substantial increase in clave unit and dollar sales volume with abbott in  as well as a significant increase in setsource unit and dollar sales volume 
net sales of the clc to abbott almost tripled to approximately million from the low levels of and we expect sales of the clc to abbott will increase in the future 
net sales of rhino were virtually unchanged  at just below million for sales of rhino started to decline in early  and while they leveled off in  they are expected to decline in the future as the market shifts to swabable technology 
there is no assurance as to the amount of any of the future sales increases to abbott 
net revenue from b 
braun  including revenue sharing  amounted to  in  compared to  in the decrease was principally because of a decrease in sales of clave products from  to  on lower unit volume  as we expected 
clave product sales to b 
braun in the fourth quarter of accounted for approximately of b 
braun s annual clave volume  as b 
braun made its final purchases under the agreement to purchase clave products 
most of the balance of the decrease in net revenue from b 
braun was in sales of the mcgaw protected needle and we expect sales to decline in the future  as they have in most recent periods  as the market for safe connectors continues to shift to needleless swabable technology 
safeline revenue sharing payments decreased slightly from last year  such payments depend on the volume and selling prices of b 
braun s safeline products  and we expect payments to trend downward in the future 
we do not expect to sell clave products to b 
braun after december  in  we commenced litigation against b 
braun over contractual and patent matters 
see item legal proceedings 
as of november   we reached a settlement with b 
braun on the contract litigation 
in the settlement  we agreed with b 
braun to dismiss the litigation over contractual matters with prejudice and terminate the agreement for b 
braun s purchase of clave products from us 
b 
braun has a product  called ultrasite  that is designed to be competitive with the clave  and which we have alleged is being marketed and sold in violation of our patent 
we filed a patent infringement suit against b 
braun in august and are vigorously pursuing the matter 
b 
braun also sells a number of other iv connectors 
while the termination of the b 
braun clave agreement could have an adverse effect on us  we do not believe that it will 
we do expect to lose some sales unit volume  but we believe many of b 
braun s customers prefer the clave to b 
braun s products  including the ultrasite  and that many of them will continue to buy clave products through other abbott or independent distributors when they are no longer available from b 
braun 
to the extent that customers needs are filled through independent distributors  we generate higher revenue and profit per clave connector  because independent distributors purchase packaged sterilized products  often complete iv sets  from us and these have a higher price than the bulk nonsterile clave sites which accounted for most of the claves that we sold to b 
braun 
net sales to independent domestic distributors increased approximately to  in from  in these sales include  of punctur guard sales after we acquired bio plexus on october   and include all sales of setfinder  inc  a subsidiary formerly reported as a separate sales channel 
the increase was due principally to an increase in custom iv systems  the inclusion of punctur guard sales for two months  and a increase in clave product sales 
the increase in sales of custom iv systems was attributable to an increase in unit volume  and we expect increased volume of custom iv systems in the future 
the increase in clave product sales was also because of higher unit volume 
we believe the increase in sales of clave products to independent distributors is principally because of acquisition of market share from b 
braun and we expect a continued increase in the net sales of standard clave products to the independent domestic distributors 
there is no assurance that we will achieve increased net sales to independent domestic distributors in the future 
further  the ability of the independent distributors to sustain or increase their sales may be impacted by competition from existing and new competitive products or acquisition of market share by abbott 
total sales to international distributors excluding canada were  in  as compared with  in we now have distribution arrangements in the principal countries in western europe  the pacific rim and latin america and in south africa 
approximately of international sales in were to distributors selling in western europe  approximately in south africa  approximately in the pacific rim and approximately in latin america 
comparable amounts in were   and 
net sales to distributors in western europe and in the pacific rim both approximately doubled over levels  as we achieved broader distribution and better acceptance of clave products in both areas 
we expect continued increases in both areas 
sales to south africa declined in from  but we expect them to increase in the future 
latin america has been a difficult market because of economic and political issues  but we are optimistic for the future 
we expect significant increases in sales to international distributors will continue in the future  although there is no assurance that those expectations will be realized 
total net sales of clave products excluding custom clave iv systems increased approximately to  in from  in unit shipments of clave products in increased approximately over abbott accounted for of the growth in dollar sales of clave  international approximately  partially offset by the decline in sales to b 
braun 
the aggregate average net selling price of clave products in was virtually the same as in  and while we expect some decrease in the future  we expect it to be less than the to annual decreases experienced over the past few years 
we expect continued significant growth in clave unit and dollar sales volume in  notwithstanding the termination of distribution through b 
braun  because of the growth that we expect in our other distribution channels 
however  there is no assurance that the expectations will be realized 
net sales of custom iv systems were  in compared to  in  an increase of  or 
the setsource program with abbott accounted for about of the increase  with most of the balance in sales to independent domestic distributors 
net sales of the clc grew from  in to  an increase of 
abbott accounted for approximately of the increase  with the balance among domestic and international distributors 
we expect sales of the clc to increase in and later years  but there is no assurance as to the amount or timing of future clc sales 
net sales of the lopez valve increased in to  on higher unit volume to domestic and international distributors 
we believe that the focus of the sales and marketing efforts of our personnel and those of our distributors on other products continues to dilute sales of the lopez valve 
we expect only modest sales increases for the lopez valve in net sales of protected needle products decreased  principally because of a decrease in sales of the mcgaw protected needle 
sales of click lock and piggy lock products were the same in both years at approximately  we discontinued sales of click lock and piggy lock products in the first quarter of  and we expect sales of the other protected needle products will decrease in the future as the safe connector market continues its shift to needleless technology 
license  royalty and revenue share income is being presented separately in our financial statements for the first time in the fourth quarter of the principal component was a payment for a fully paid up license to use certain of our patents of million received in december  royalties received for other companies use of punctur guard technology of  and safeline revenue share fourth quarter only of approximately million 
the royalties for use of punctur guard technology and safeline revenue share are expected to continue  although the amounts may vary form period to period 
we do expect to receive other license fees or royalties for the use of our technology such as the one received in december  but we can give no assurance as to the amounts or timing of such payments  or whether any such payment will be received 
we received a payment of million in february that will be included in revenue in the first quarter of gross margin for  calculated on net sales and excluding other revenue  declined from in to in because of significant unabsorbed overhead in the fourth quarter of this occurred because of three weeks of substantially reduced production in mexico as a result of difficulty in processing orders and preparing production orders at the time we implemented our new enterprise software  and because of a planned two week shutdown of the automated production facility in san clemente for preventive maintenance in december 
until the fourth quarter  gross margins had been at 
we expect that our gross margins could decline somewhat from those in because of costs related to the plant expansion in mexico in  and because gross margin on the punctur guard line has historically been lower than that of the rest of the company 
selling  general and administrative sg a costs increased by  or  to  in  compared to  in sg a costs were of net revenue in compared to in we expect sg a costs to increase in because of growth in the company  international expansion  and expansion of the custom iv system business 
sales and marketing costs increased approximately million  but decreased as a percentage of sales from to 
increases were principally in salaries and related costs and travel 
general and administrative costs increased approximately million  and were approximately of net revenue in both years 
increases were principally in salary and benefits 
research and development r d costs increased in by  to  and were approximately of net revenue in both and the principal increase in spending was on product development for the punctur guard product line to make product improvements that we felt were necessary to successfully market and sell the products 
spending on new product development also increased from we estimate that r d costs will continue in at approximately the same percentage of net sales as in however r d costs could differ from those estimates and the r d may not be completed as expected 
we expect to launch an infusion device using punctur guard technology in the second quarter of these devices will be used for short term drug administration therapy 
we plan to launch  in limited markets  a new iv connector currently under development 
we expect to apply in the second half of to the fda under section k of the fdc act for approval to market this new connector 
there is no assurance that the fda will grant marketing clearance  that we will launch this new product  or that it will achieve sales if and when we commence marketing it 
the operating margin increased to in  compared to in  principally because operating expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales 
investment income decreased by  in  notwithstanding an increase in the investment portfolio  because of the effect of continuing declines in interest rates since the beginning of our effective income tax rate in was  up from in principally because state tax credits were lower in than in and tax exempt investment income declined as a percentage of taxable income 
we expect our effective tax rate in to be approximately the same as the rate 
net income in increased from principally because the gross profit increased  but operating expenses increased only 
this resulted in a increase in operating margin that was partially offset by the decline in investment income and the increase in the effective income tax rate 
net income per share diluted increased  or 
the percentage increase in earnings per share was less than that for net income because there were more shares outstanding 
comparison of to in  we had net revenue of  that was  or  higher than the net revenue of  reported in the increase was primarily attributable to the increase in sales of clave products  including custom clave iv systems 
net sales to abbott were  in  compared to  in clave sales increased to  from  because of an increase in unit volume somewhat offset by lower average selling prices 
sales under the setsource program approximated  for the year  they increased monthly and exceeded  for the month of december net sales of the clc and rhino declined as abbott balanced its inventory position 
sales of custom clave iv sets declined as production of several high volume sets was transferred to abbott 
net revenue from b 
braun  including revenue sharing  amounted to  in  compared to  in the decrease was principally because of a decrease in clave sales 
unit sales of clave products to b 
braun increased  but a decrease in average selling prices  in part because of a decrease in prices and in part because of a change in the product mix to lower priced products  more than offset the effect of higher unit volume 
sales of the mcgaw protected needle increased in from and safeline revenue sharing payments in decreased from net sales to independent domestic distributors increased approximately to  in from  in the increase was due principally to a increase in custom iv systems partially offset by a decrease in clave product sales because of lower unit volume 
the increase in sales of custom iv systems was attributable to an increase in unit volume  approximately one third of the increase was from increased sales of custom iv systems incorporating the o valve 
the decrease in clave product sales was because of lower unit volume 
we believe the decline in sales of clave products is principally because of acquisition of market share by abbott and b 
braun 
total sales to international distributors excluding canada were  in  as compared with  in approximately of international sales in were to distributors selling in western europe  approximately in south africa  approximately in the pacific rim and approximately in latin america 
total net sales of clave products excluding custom clave iv systems increased approximately to  in from  in unit shipments of clave products in increased approximately over abbott accounted for of the growth in dollar sales of clave  international approximately  partially offset by the decline in b 
braun and independent domestic distributors 
the aggregate average net selling price of clave products in decreased approximately as compared with that decrease reflects lower prices on bulk  non sterile clave products sold to abbott and b 
braun  as well as a higher percentage of the sales mix being accounted for by bulk  non sterile claves 
net sales of custom iv systems were  in compared to  in sales of non proprietary and generic iv sets accounted for substantially all of the net increase 
net sales of the clc were approximately the same in as they were in the decline in sales to abbott was offset by increased sales to domestic and foreign distributors 
net sales of the lopez valve decreased in to  on lower unit volume to domestic and international distributors 
we had expected sales to increase in  but we believe that the focus of the sales and marketing efforts of our personnel and those of our distributors on other products diluted the sales of the lopez valve 
net sales of protected needle products increased slightly  as increased sales of the mcgaw protected needle offset decreased sales of click lock and piggy lock products 
gross margin for was unchanged from the registered in the results of our continuing extensive efforts to improve manufacturing efficiency and the increased absorption of overhead by higher production volumes offset the effect of lower average unit selling prices 
electrical energy costs at our manufacturing facilities in the second half of continued to moderate somewhat from the first and second quarters of  but were still approximately double what they were in the first quarter of  the last quarter before the sharp rate increase experienced since may most of the increase was because of rate increases 
electrical energy costs were approximately of sales in the second half of  down from of sales in the third and fourth quarters of and the first quarter of sg a costs increased by  or  to  in  compared to  in sg a costs were of net sales in compared to in spending increased for litigation and administrative costs 
sales and marketing costs increased  but decreased as a percentage of sales 
r d costs decreased in by  to  or of net sales  as compared to  or of net sales in spending on new product development including development of automated production machinery in was lower than in  as was spending on clinical evaluations of the clc costs of software development to support manufacturing and distribution of custom iv systems increased in the operating margin increased to in  compared to in  principally because operating expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales 
investment income decreased by  in  notwithstanding an increase in the investment portfolio  because of the effect of declines in interest rates since the beginning of our effective income tax rate in was  down from in principally because of state tax credits 
net income in increased from principally because the gross profit increased  but operating expenses increased only 
net income per share diluted increased  or 
the percentage increase in earnings per share was less than that for net income  because there were more shares outstanding and there were more dilutive shares as a result of the higher market price of our common stock 
liquidity and capital resources during  working capital increased approximately  to  from  our cash and cash equivalents and liquid investment securities increased by  to  from  that increase was due primarily to  of cash flows from operating activities excluding tax benefits from exercise of stock options and  from exercise of stock options including tax benefits  partially offset by  used to purchase property and equipment and  used to acquire bio plexus net of cash acquired 
during  working capital increased approximately  to  from  our cash and cash equivalents and liquid investment securities increased by  to  from  that increase was due primarily to  of cash flows from operating activities excluding tax benefits from exercise of stock options and  from exercise of stock options including tax benefits  partially offset by  used to purchase property and equipment 
capital expenditures increased in principally for investment in molding machines  molds and automated assembly machines  as well as recurring facilities improvements and acquisition of computer equipment and software 
we are also acquiring sterilization equipment to support our assembly facility in mexico  and expanding that facility 
we also replaced our enterprise software with oracle corporation s ri business suite at a cost of over million excluding amounts charged to expense  we expect that it will substantially enhance our business and information processes 
capital expenditures increased in principally for investment in molding machines  molds and automated assembly machines  as well as recurring facilities improvements and acquisition of computer equipment and software 
we currently estimate that capital expenditures for will be approximately million 
we expect that million will be spent on completion of the million expansion in mexico  including an electron beam sterilizer  million on molds  molding equipment and automated assembly equipment  and million on computers and software 
of those amounts  approximately million was committed under contracts at december   and we expect to commit the balance in amounts of spending are estimates and actual spending may substantially differ from those amounts 
we are currently evaluating the design and capacity of our manufacturing facilities 
we estimate that our current facilities and additions in progress will be adequate through  but that production after will require additional clean room facilities for molding and automated assembly 
we expect to decide later in the year how to meet the need for additional facilities and the location of additional clean room facilities for molding and automated assembly 
in we acquired bio plexus and paid for it from our existing working capital 
we may acquire other businesses or product lines in the future 
we expect that sales of our products will continue to grow in if sales continue to increase  accounts receivable and inventories are expected to increase as well 
as a result of these and other factors  we expect the use of working capital to fund our operations to continue to increase 
accounts receivable increased from  at december  to  at december   or  approximately the same percentage as the increase in net revenue 
inventories increased from  at december  to  at december   an increase of  and far greater than our increase in net sales 
inventory at bio plexus acquired in  was  at december  of the remaining  increase  approximately half was in finished goods  mostly because of the shipments that were deferred from december to early the other half was in raw materials as we increased the amount of components in stock to avoid lack of components needed to meet production schedules  mostly because a number of suppliers showed an inability to reliably meet the demands of our increased volume 
in february  we purchased  shares of our common stock for million  and in march  we purchased an additional  shares for million 
until those purchases  we had not purchased treasury stock since october  except for a small amount in march we may purchase additional shares in the future 
however  future acquisitions  if any  will depend on market conditions and other factors 
we have a large cash and liquid investment position generated from profitable operations and stock sales  principally from the exercise of employee stock options 
we maintain this position to fund our growth  meet increasing working capital requirements  fund capital expenditures  and potentially to take advantage of acquisition opportunities that may arise 
our primary investment goal is capital preservation  so  as further described in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  our liquid investments have very little credit risk or market risk 
we believe that our existing working capital  supplemented by income from operations  will be sufficient to fund our capital expenditures and increased working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
forward looking statements various portions of this annual report  including management s discussion and analysis  describe trends in our business and finances that we perceive and state some of our expectations and beliefs about our future 
these statements about the future are forward looking statements  and we identify them by using words such as believes  expects  anticipates  estimates  intends  plans  will  continuing  could  and similar expressions and by statements about aims  goals and plans 
the forward looking statements are based on the best information currently available to us and assumptions that we believe are reasonable  but we do not intend the statements to be representations as to future results 
they include  among other things  statements about o future operating results and various elements of operating results  including sales and unit volumes of products  future increases in sales of custom iv systems  future license  royalty and revenue share income  production costs  gross margins  sg a  and r d expense and income taxes  o factors affecting operating results  such as shipments to specific customers  product mix  selling prices  warranty claims  rebates  returns  the market shift to needleless products  declines in sales of certain products  impact of safety legislation  achievement of business expansion goals  development of innovative systems capabilities  introduction and sales of new products  manufacturing efficiencies  labor costs  unit production costs  acquisition and use of production equipment and expansion of facilities and assembly capacity  expansion of markets and establishment of production facilities outside north america  business seasonality and customer ordering patterns  o new or extended contracts with manufacturers and buying organizations  and dependence on a small number of customers  effect of termination of b 
braun clave agreement  o regulatory approvals  assertion of patent rights  and outcome of litigation  o competitive and market factors  including continuing development of competing products by other manufacturers  consolidation of the healthcare provider market and downward pressure on selling prices  and o working capital requirements  changes in accounts receivable and inventories  capital expenditures  acquisitions of other businesses or product lines and common stock repurchases 
the kinds of statements described above and similar forward looking statements about our future performance are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties which one should consider in evaluating the statements 
first  one should consider the factors and risks described in the statements themselves 
these factors are uncertain  and if one or more of them turn out differently than we currently expect  our operating results may differ materially from our current expectations 
second  one should read the forward looking statements in conjunction with the risk factors in our current report on form k to the securities and exchange commission dated february   which is incorporated by reference 
third  our actual future operating results are subject to other important factors that we cannot predict or control  including among others the following o general economic and business conditions  o the effect of price and safety considerations on the healthcare industry  o competitive factors  such as product innovation  new technologies  marketing and distribution strength and price erosion  o unanticipated market shifts and trends  o the impact of legislation affecting government reimbursement of healthcare costs  o changes by our major customers and independent distributors in their strategies that might affect their efforts to market our products  o unanticipated production problems  and o the availability of patent protection and the cost of enforcing and of defending patent claims 
we disclaim any obligation to update the statements or to announce publicly the result of any revision to any of the statements contained herein to reflect future events or developments 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have a portfolio of corporate preferred stocks and federal tax exempt state and municipal government debt securities 
the securities are all investment grade and we believe that we have virtually no exposure to credit risk 
dividend and interest rates reset at auction for most of the securities from between seven and forty nine day intervals  with some longer but none beyond twelve months  so we have very little market risk  that is  risk that the fair value of the security will change because of changes in market interest rates  they are readily saleable at par at auction dates  and can normally be sold at par between auction dates 
our future earnings are subject to potential increase or decrease because of changes in short term interest rates 
generally  each one percentage point change in the discount rate will cause our overall yield to change by two thirds to three quarters of a percentage point  depending upon the relative mix of federal tax exempt securities and corporate preferred stocks in the portfolio and market conditions specific to the securities in which we invest 
we do not have any significant foreign currency risk 
sales to foreign distributors are all denominated in us dollars 
cash and receivables in entities outside the united states  principally in mexico  which are denominated in foreign currency are insignificant and are generally offset by accounts payable in the same foreign currency
