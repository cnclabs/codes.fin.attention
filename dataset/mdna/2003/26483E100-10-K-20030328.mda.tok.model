item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
you should not conclude from our presentation of non core gains and charges that the items that result in non core gains and charges will not occur in the future 
we believe these measures are useful to you because they reflect how we manage our business 
however  these measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for total revenue  operating income or diluted earnings per share prepared in accordance with gaap 
we discuss our financial results prepared in accordance with gaap beginning on page in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  you should note that because not all companies calculate these financial measures similarly or at all  the presentation of these measures is not likely to be comparable to measures of other companies

our strategy in october  we launched our blueprint for growth strategy  the roadmap to our aspiration to become a growth company with an important presence on the web 
as noted earlier  the blueprint for growth has five components  each of which is described below 
leverage our brand the focus of this component of our strategy is to build and increase awareness of our more than years of experience in providing trusted business information solutions 
in october  we began the transition of our company trade name from dun bradstreet to d b  our widely used and highly recognizable acronym 
we also introduced a new logo and the decide with confidence tm tag line to describe the value that d b brings to our customers decision making processes 
during  we launched the d b sure tm television  print and radio advertising campaign to increase our brand awareness 
to strengthen our brand  we are continuing to build and expand our global database  which included approximately million businesses at the end of  up from million upon the launch of our strategy in october and million at the beginning of we also continue to invest in the timeliness and accuracy of our data 
create financial flexibility as part of our blueprint for growth strategy  we continually seek opportunities to reallocate our spending to activities that drive revenue growth while  at the same time  improving our profitability during our transformation 

table of contents through a structured process we call creating financial flexibility  we target activities and processes that can be re engineered or eliminated 
we identify these activities by seeking out ways to improve our performance  both in terms of cost and quality 
we look for ways to eliminate  consolidate  standardize and automate the operations of our business  in that order 
after we have fully realized internal efficiencies  we evaluate the possibility that others can provide greater efficiencies and improved quality 
if they can  we outsource 
for example  as part of our financial flexibility program  we have eliminated non core operations  such as our receivable management services business  which we sold during  consolidated our european operations from separate country operations into one continent wide operation  begun to standardize on best practices  and substantially reduced country level management infrastructure  automated and simplified data collection from third party data sources  and outsourced certain technology functions  including our data center operations  to computer sciences corporation 
since the launch of our blueprint for growth strategy in october  we have implemented three phases of financial flexibility initiatives 
in each of these phases  we identified ways to reduce our expense base  then reallocated some of the identified spending to other areas of our operations to drive revenue growth 
with each phase of initiatives  we have incurred a restructuring charge which generally consists of employee severance and termination costs  asset write offs  and or costs to terminate lease obligations and transition costs which consist of other costs necessary to accomplish the process changes such as consulting fees  costs of temporary workers  relocation costs and stay bonuses 
the initial impact of each phase on our expense base before any restructuring charges and transition costs and before any reallocation of spending  and the related restructuring charge and transition costs for each phase  are as follows phase initially reduced our expense base by million on an annualized basis before any reallocation of spending 
it resulted in a million restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of  of which million was reversed in as excess 
it also resulted in million of transition costs incurred primarily in phase initially reduced our expense base by million on an annualized basis before any reallocation of spending 
it resulted in a million restructuring charge in the second quarter of it also resulted in an aggregate of million of transition costs in and phase initially reduced our expense base by million on an annualized basis before any reallocation of spending 
it resulted in a million restructuring charge in the second quarter of it also resulted in million of transition costs in  with between million and million of additional transition costs expected in a fourth phase of financial flexibility initiatives  announced in january  is expected to initially reduce our expense base by million on an annualized basis  before any restructuring charges and transition costs and before any reallocation of spending 
we expect this phase to result in a restructuring charge of million and transition costs of million in in total  including all phases of financial flexibility initiatives  we expect transition costs of between million and million in the decision about how much to reallocate to other areas of our operations to drive revenue growth is initially made as part of our annual business planning and budgeting process 
we then revisit the allocation of our expenditures regularly over the course of the year 
we believe the success of our flexible business model is illustrated by a comparison of our financial results from the year our blueprint for growth strategy was launched through during this period  while our total revenue declined by million  or  primarily due to the sale of non core businesses  our core revenue grew million  or  reflecting the benefit of the new spending on 
table of contents revenue growth initiatives described in the section below 
over the three year period  we incurred restructuring charges totaling million and transition costs totaling million 
even after incurring these charges and costs  our total operating costs were reduced over the period by million  or  and our operating income increased million  or enhance our current business our current customer solution sets are risk management solutions  sales marketing solutions  and supply management solutions 
in addition  in  we launched a series of e business solutions that offer access to  and delivery of  d b products via the web

in assessing the revenue growth opportunities in this product line  we evaluate the market from the perspective of a chief credit officer 
today  credit officers use our products primarily to make credit decisions on new credit applications for large over  transactions 
in the current economic climate  
table of contents new credit applications are declining as business activity is depressed and companies are streamlining their credit departments  resulting in fewer product users 
to enhance this area of our business  we are increasing our database coverage and expanding the scope of the information we maintain about the businesses in our database

the year was particularly challenging  with economic weakness  the events of september and the subsequent anthrax scare adversely affecting our growth in this product line 
our performance improved in  with core revenue growth before the effects of foreign exchange  though it did not achieve the growth rate of we believe our sales marketing solutions product line will be an important part of our long term growth  subject to prevailing economic conditions and our ability to execute on the investments identified below 
we will continue to invest in this product line through sales force expansion  database enhancements and product improvements sales force expansion we are investing to increase the size of our specialized sales and marketing sales force  while reducing the number of accounts covered by each sales professional to better enable account penetration 
database enhancements we will continue to build the depth and completeness of our global database  focusing on demographic and other data elements that are most critical in helping our sales marketing solutions customers find new  profitable customers 
product improvements we are improving our product offerings to generate growth 
for example  we are enhancing our customers ability to combine d b data with their own customer data more easily and accurately

nonetheless  we now view supply management solutions as a product line in which we can  with the proper investment and focus  show growth 
to drive growth  we have created a suite of offerings that enable customers to save money and time  by helping them analyze their purchasing spend  find the best suppliers and manage their supply base

acquiring and growing our business from web based customers 
we continually enhance our web site to make it easier for our customers to understand the solutions we offer  find what they are looking for and purchase what they need

competition we are subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our business 
a number of competitors are active in specific aspects of our business 
however  we believe no competitor offers our complete line of solutions 
in north america  we are a market leader in our risk management solutions business in terms of market share and revenue 
we compete with a broad range of companies  including consumer credit companies such as experian information solutions  inc  which have traditionally primarily offered consumer information services  but now offer products that combine consumer information with business information as a tool to help customers make credit decisions with respect to small businesses 
we compete with a broad range of companies offering products similar to our sales marketing solutions and supply management solutions 
in our sales marketing solutions business  our competitors include acxiom corporation  experian information solutions  inc  and infousa  inc 
in our supply management solutions business  we compete with large consulting firms such as cap gemini ernst young and deloitte consulting  as well as our customers own purchasing departments 
outside north america  the competitive environment varies by country 
in some countries  leadership positions exist  while in others the markets are highly fragmented 
our competition is primarily local 
we also face competition from the in house operations of the businesses we seek as customers  other general and specialized credit reporting and business information services  other information and professional service providers  and credit insurers 
in addition  business information products and services are becoming more readily available  principally due to the expansion of the internet and the emergence of new providers of business information products and services 
weak economic conditions have also resulted in customers seeking to utilize free or lower cost information that is available from alternative sources such as the internet 
in addition  in certain markets  such as europe  we have experienced  and may 
table of contents continue to experience  pricing pressures as some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by reducing prices 
we have also experienced  and may continue to experience  pricing pressures from our larger customers in north america 
we believe our quality global database gives us a competitive advantage with respect to customers seeking worldwide business information coverage 
our ability to continue to compete effectively will be based on a number of factors  including our ability to attract local customers to the worldwide information services offered by our unique database  our ability to demonstrate value through our decision making tools and integration capabilities  including the power of our dunsright tm quality process and the d b d u n s number  our matching capabilities and related linkages  the reliability and quality of our information  our brand perception  our ability to deliver business information through various media and distribution channels in formats tailored to customer requirements  and our ability to attract and retain a high performing workforce

item properties our executive offices are located at jfk parkway  short hills  new jersey  in a  square foot property that we lease 
this property also serves as the executive offices of our north america business 
our other properties are geographically distributed to meet sales and operating requirements worldwide 
we generally consider these properties to be both suitable and adequate to meet current operating requirements  and most of the space is being utilized 
the most important of these other properties include the following sites that we own a  square foot office building in parsippany  new jersey  housing personnel from our sales  marketing and technology groups  and a  square foot office building in high wycombe  england  which houses operational and technology services for europe and serves as the executive offices for our european business 
we are currently in negotiations to sell our high wycombe building 
we intend to continue operations from a portion of the building for a multi year period after the sale 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
we also conduct operations from offices located throughout the us  all of which are leased  and us office locations  of which are leased 
item legal proceedings we are involved in tax and legal proceedings  claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business 
we periodically assess our liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters based upon the latest information available 
for those matters where it is probable that we have incurred a loss 
table of contents and the loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated  we have recorded reserves in our consolidated financial statements 
in other instances  we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of any liability because of the uncertainties related to both the probable outcome and amount or range of loss 
as additional information becomes available  we adjust our assessment and estimates of such liabilities accordingly 
based on our review of the latest information available  we believe our ultimate liability in connection with pending tax and legal proceedings  claims and litigation will not have a material effect on our results of operations  cash flows or financial position  with the possible exception of the matters described below 
in order to understand our exposure to the potential liabilities described below  it is important to understand the relationship between us and moody s corporation  our predecessors and other parties that  through various corporate reorganizations and contractual commitments  have assumed varying degrees of responsibility with respect to such matters 
in november  the company then known as the dun bradstreet corporation d b separated through a spin off into three separate public companies d b  acnielsen corporation acnielsen and cognizant corporation cognizant the distribution 
in june  d b separated through a spin off into two separate public companies d b  which changed its name to rh donnelley corporation donnelley d b  and a new company named the dun bradstreet corporation d b the distribution 
during  cognizant separated through a spin off into two separate public companies ims health incorporated ims and nielsen media research  inc nmr the cognizant distribution 
in september  d b separated through a spin off into two separate public companies d b  which changed its name to moody s corporation moody s  and a new company named the dun bradstreet corporation we or d b and also referred to elsewhere in this form k as d b the distribution 
tax matters d b and its predecessors entered into global tax planning initiatives in the normal course of business  principally through tax free restructurings of both their foreign and domestic operations 
the status of internal revenue service reviews of these initiatives is summarized below 
pursuant to a series of agreements  ims and nmr are jointly and severally liable for and must pay one half  and we and moody s are jointly and severally liable for and must pay the other half  of any payments over million for taxes  accrued interest and other amounts resulting from unfavorable irs rulings on the tax matters summarized below other than the matter summarized below as amortization expense deductions  for which we and moody s are solely responsible 
d b was contractually obligated to pay  and did pay  the first million in connection with the matter summarized below as utilization of capital losses under the terms of the distribution  we and moody s have  between each other  agreed to each be financially responsible for of any potential liabilities that may arise to the extent such potential liabilities are not directly attributable to each party s respective business operations 
utilization of capital losses the irs completed its review of the utilization of certain capital losses generated during and and  on june   issued a formal notice of adjustment 
on may   an amended tax return was filed for the and tax periods  which reflected million of tax and interest due 
d b paid the irs approximately million of this amount on may   and ims paid the irs approximately million on may  the payments were made to the irs to stop further interest from accruing 
we are continuing to contest  on behalf of donnelley d b  the irs s formal assessment and would also contest any assessment of amounts in excess of the amounts paid 
donnelley d b filed a complaint for a refund in the us district court on september  the case is 
table of contents expected to go to trial in we would share responsibility for any additional assessment  and share in any refund obtained  with ims  nmr and moody s  as discussed above 
subsequent to making its payment to the irs  ims sought to obtain partial reimbursement from nmr under the terms of the cognizant distribution 
nmr paid ims less than ims sought 
in  ims filed an arbitration proceeding against nmr claiming that nmr underpaid to ims its proper allocation of the above tax payments 
neither donnelley d b nor we are a party to the cognizant distribution 
ims nonetheless sought to include donnelley d b in this arbitration  arguing that if nmr should prevail in its interpretation  then ims could seek the same interpretation in an alternative claim against donnelley d b in  the arbitration panel ruled that donnelley d b properly belonged as a party to the arbitration 
hearings before the arbitration panel were held in a decision from the arbitration panel is expected in if nmr should prevail in the arbitration against ims and  in turn  ims should prevail against donnelley d b  then we believe that the additional liability to donnelley d b would be approximately million  net of tax benefits 
as noted above  under the terms of the distribution  moody s and we are each responsible for one half of any amount for which donnelley d b is liable in this matter 
we believe that the claim asserted against donnelley d b by ims is without merit 
no amount in respect of this matter has been accrued in our consolidated financial statements 
royalty expense deductions in the second quarter of  we received on behalf of donnelley d b notices of proposed adjustment from the irs with respect to a partnership transaction entered into in specifically  the irs proposed to disallow certain royalty expense deductions claimed by donnelley d b on its  and tax returns 
in verbal communications with the irs later in  the irs expressed a willingness to withdraw its proposed disallowance of related royalty expense deductions for  but in a february letter the irs asserted a position that would disallow a portion of the royalty expense deduction 
the irs has also indicated its intention to assert penalties for and we have disagreed with the positions taken by the irs 
however  if the irs were to issue a formal assessment and prevail  we would share responsibility for the assessment with moody s  ims and nmr  as disclosed above 
if the irs were to issue a formal assessment and we  on behalf of donnelley d b  were to challenge the assessment in us district court rather than in us tax court  the disputed amounts would need to be paid 
we estimate that the disallowance of the royalty expense deduction would result in a loss of million in tax refunds 
we also estimate that the disallowance of the and royalty expense deductions would require payment from us of up to million tax  interest and penalties  net of associated tax benefits 
in addition  in february  the partnership associated with this transaction received a preliminary notice from the irs that challenges the tax treatment of certain royalty payments received by the partnership in which donnelley d b was a partner and which relate to the royalty expense deductions referred to above 
the irs would reallocate certain partnership income to donnelley d b  and we would share responsibility for this matter with moody s  ims and nmr  as disclosed above 
our share of this income would require an additional payment from us of million tax  interest and penalties  net of associated tax benefits 
we have disagreed with the position taken by the irs on behalf of the partnership  in part because this position is inconsistent with the irs position with respect to the royalty expense deduction described above 
amortization expense deductions the irs has requested documentation with respect to a transaction entered into in by d b that produces amortization expense deductions 
while we believe the deductions are appropriate  the irs could ultimately challenge them and issue an assessment 
if the irs were to prevail or the assessment were to be challenged by us in us district court  we estimate that our cash payment to the irs with respect to deductions claimed to date and including any potential assessment of penalties of million  
table of contents could be up to million  or million  net of associated tax benefits 
this transaction is scheduled to expire in and  unless earlier terminated by us  our cash exposure  based on current interest rates and tax rates  would increase at a rate of approximately million per quarter including potential penalties as future amortization expenses are deducted 
we have considered the foregoing tax matters and the merits of our legal defenses and the various contractual obligations in our overall assessment of potential tax liabilities 
we believe we have adequate reserves recorded in our consolidated financial statements for our share of current exposures in these matters 
any payments that would be made for these exposures would be significant to us in the period a cash payment took place 
legal proceedings information resources  inc in july  information resources  inc iri  filed a complaint in the us district court for the southern district of new york  naming as defendants donnelley d b  ac nielsen company a subsidiary of acnielsen corporation and ims international  inc a subsidiary of the company then known as cognizant corporation 
at the time of the filing of the complaint  each of the other defendants was a wholly owned subsidiary of donnelley d b the complaint alleges various violations of united states antitrust laws  including alleged violations of sections and of the sherman antitrust act 
the complaint also alleges a claim of tortious interference with a contract and a claim of tortious interference with a prospective business relationship 
these claims relate to the acquisition by defendants of survey research group limited srg 
iri alleges srg violated an alleged agreement with iri when it agreed to be acquired by the defendants and that the defendants induced srg to breach that agreement 
iri s complaint alleges damages in excess of million  which amount iri asked to be trebled under antitrust laws 
iri also seeks punitive damages in an unspecified amount 
in connection with the distribution  cognizant  acnielsen and donnelley d b entered into an indemnity and joint defense agreement  pursuant to which they agreed to allocate potential liabilities iri liabilities that may arise out of or in connection with the iri action  and conduct a joint defense of such action 
in particular  the indemnity and joint defense agreement provides that acnielsen will assume exclusive liability for iri liabilities up to a maximum amount to be calculated at such time as such liabilities become payable the acn maximum amount  and donnelley d b and cognizant will share liability equally for any amounts in excess of the acn maximum amount 
the acn maximum amount will be determined by an investment banking firm as the maximum amount that acnielsen is able to pay after giving effect to any plan submitted by such investment bank that is designed to maximize the claims paying ability of acnielsen without impairing the investment banking firm s ability to deliver a viability opinion and without requiring stockholder approval  and payment of related fees and expenses 

table of contents for these purposes  viability means the ability of acnielsen  after giving effect to such plan  the payment of related fees and expenses  and the payment of the acn maximum amount  to pay its debts as they become due  and finance the current and anticipated operating and capital requirements of its business  as reconstituted by such plan  for two years from the date any such plan is expected to be implemented 
in  acnielsen merged with vnu nv vnu nv assumed acnielsen s liabilities under the indemnity and joint defense agreement  and vnu nv s business is to be included for purposes of determining the acn maximum amount 
under the terms of the distribution  d b assumed all potential liabilities of donnelley d b arising from the iri action 
under the terms of the distribution  we undertook to be jointly and severally liable with moody s for d b s obligations to donnelley d b under the distribution  including any liabilities arising under the indemnity and joint defense agreement 
however  as agreed between each other  we and moody s will each be responsible for of any payments to be made with respect to the iri action under the terms of the distribution  including legal fees or expenses related to the iri action 
ims and nmr are each jointly and severally liable for all cognizant liabilities under the indemnity and joint defense agreement 
no trial date has been set  and discovery is ongoing 
we are unable to predict at this time the final outcome of the iri action or whether the resolution of this matter could materially affect our results of operations  cash flows or financial position

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations how we manage our business until december   we managed our business on a geographical basis with three operating segments us and canada  which we refer to as north america  is our largest segment  contributing of our total revenue  europe  africa and middle east  which we refer to as europe  is our next largest segment  representing of our total revenue  and asia pacific and latin america  which we refer to as apla  is our smallest segment  representing of our total revenue 
on january   we began managing our businesses in europe and apla as a single segment  referred to as international 
in each segment  we sell our core product lines risk management solutions our largest solution set  which contributed of our total revenue in  sales marketing solutions our next largest solution set  which contributed of total revenue  and supply management solutions our smallest solution set  which contributed of total revenue in these core product lines  or customer solution sets  are discussed in greater detail in item business 
within our risk management solutions and our sales marketing solutions  we monitor the performance of our older  more traditional products and our newer  value added products  because we expect the value added products to be the drivers of d b s future revenue growth 
our traditional risk management solutions generally consist of reports derived from our database which are used primarily for making decisions about new credit applications 
an example is our business information report  or bir 
our traditional risk management solutions constituted of our risk management solutions revenue and of our total revenue in our value added risk management solutions generally support automated decision making and portfolio management through the use of scoring and integrated software solutions 
our value added risk management solutions constituted of our risk management solutions revenue and of our total revenue in our traditional sales marketing solutions generally consist of lists  labels and customized data files used by our customers in their direct mail and direct marketing activities  and constituted of our sales marketing solutions revenue and of our total revenue in our value added sales marketing solutions generally include decision making and customer information management solutions  and constituted of our sales marketing solutions revenue and of our total revenue in for internal management purposes  we use total revenue excluding the revenue of divested businesses  which we refer to as core revenue  to manage and evaluate the performance of our business segments  because it reflects revenue from our ongoing operations 
core revenue includes the revenue from acquired businesses from the date of acquisition 
divested businesses include our receivable management services business  sold in the second quarter of  our australia new zealand operation  sold in the third quarter of  and smaller operations in several other countries in apla sold during or these divested  non core businesses have been classified as receivable management services and other divested businesses in note of our consolidated financial statements 
we also isolate the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on our business because  while we take steps to manage our exposure to foreign currency  we believe that changes in revenue growth due to 
table of contents exchange rate movements are not reflective of our underlying business performance 
as a result  we monitor our core revenue growth both including and excluding the effects of foreign exchange 
we refer to these measures as revenue growth after the effects of foreign exchange and before the effects of foreign exchange  respectively 
we evaluate the performance of our business segments based on segment revenue growth before the effects of foreign exchange  and segment operating income growth before certain types of gains and charges 
specifically  for management reporting purposes  we evaluate business segment performance before restructuring charges whether recurring or non recurring and certain other items identified on page we do not consider reflective of our underlying business performance which we refer to as non core gains and charges  and before non operating income or expenses 
additionally  transition costs  which are period costs such as consulting fees  costs of temporary employees  relocation costs and stay bonuses incurred to implement the financial flexibility component of our strategy  are reported as corporate and other expenses and are not allocated to our business segments 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for financial information regarding our segments 
when we evaluate the performance of our business as a whole  we focus on diluted earnings per share excluding non core gains and charges because we do not consider these charges and items to reflect our underlying business performance 
you should not conclude from our definition of non core gains and charges that the items that result in non core gains and charges will not occur in the future 
we believe these measures are useful because they reflect how we manage our business 
while we use these financial measures for the reasons stated above  these measures are not prepared in accordance with gaap and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for total revenue  operating income or diluted earnings per share prepared in accordance with gaap 
in addition  you should note that because not all companies calculate these financial measures similarly or at all  the presentation of these measures is not likely to be comparable to measures of other companies 
see results of operations  below  for a discussion of our results reported on a gaap basis 
our flexible business model and restructuring as part of our blueprint for growth strategy  we continually seek opportunities to reallocate our spending to activities that drive revenue growth while  at the same time  improving our profitability during our transformation 
this is a structured process we call creating financial flexibility 
since october  we have implemented three phases of financial flexibility initiatives 
our financial flexibility process is discussed in more detail under item business our strategy create financial flexibility 
with each phase of initiatives  we have incurred a restructuring charge  which generally consists of employee severance and termination costs  asset write offs  and or costs to terminate lease obligations 
these charges are incurred as a result of eliminating  consolidating  standardizing  automating and or outsourcing operations of our business 
we have also incurred transition costs such as consulting fees  costs of temporary workers  relocation costs and stay bonuses to implement our financial flexibility actions 
we believe the success of our flexible business model is illustrated by a comparison of our financial results from the year the blueprint for growth strategy was launched through during this period  while our total revenue declined by million  or  primarily due to the sale of non core businesses  our core revenue grew million  or  reflecting the benefit of the new spending on revenue growth initiatives described in item business our strategy enhance our current business 
over the three year period  we incurred restructuring charges totaling million and transition costs totaling million 
even after incurring these charges  our total operating expenses were reduced over the period by million  or  and our operating income increased million  or 
see results of operations  below  for a more complete discussion of our financial results  including these restructuring charges 

table of contents our critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements and accounting for the underlying transactions and balances reflected therein  we have applied the significant accounting policies described in notes and to our consolidated financial statements 
of those policies  we consider the policies described below to be critical because they are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results  and they require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have discussed the selection and application of our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure regarding critical accounting policies and estimates in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
pension and postretirement benefit obligations we offer substantially all of our us based employees coverage in a defined benefit plan called the dun bradstreet retirement account the us qualified plan 
pension costs are determined actuarially and funded in accordance with the internal revenue code 
we also maintain supplemental and excess plans in the united states the us non qualified plans to provide retirement benefits in excess of levels allowed by the internal revenue code 
these plans are unfunded  pay as you go plans 
our employees in canada and the united kingdom are also provided retirement benefits through defined benefit plans 
in addition to providing pension benefits  we provide various health care and life insurance benefits for retirees 
us based employees who retire with years of vesting service after age are eligible to receive benefits 
postretirement benefit costs and obligations are also determined actuarially 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  our pension benefit obligations and related effects on operations are calculated using actuarial models 
other postretirement benefits ie  health care are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  and are also dependent on the application of our assumptions by our outside actuaries 
the key assumptions we have made  which we evaluate annually  include discount rate which is used to measure the present value of pension plan obligations and postretirement health care obligations 
it is based on investment yields available at year end on aa rated corporate long term bonds 
rates of compensation increase and cash balance accumulation conversion rates which are based on an evaluation of internal plans and external market indicators 
expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets which is based on current and expected asset allocations as well as expected returns on asset categories of plan investments 
health care cost trends which are based on historical cost data  the near term outlook and an assessment of likely long term trends 
while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate  changes in these assumptions would affect our pension and other postretirement benefit costs 
the factor with the most immediate impact on our financial statements is the change in the expected long term rate of return on assets for the us qualified plan 
for  we will lower this assumption to from the assumption we used to calculate pension income in  and the assumption represents our best estimate of the expected long term future investment performance of the us qualified plan at this time  after considering revised expectations for future capital market returns and the plan s asset allocation 
as of december   the plan was invested in publicly traded equity securities  invested in 
table of contents publicly traded fixed income securities and invested in real estate investments 
we expect that this one percentage point decrease in the long term rate of return will reduce our annual operating income by approximately million by reducing our net periodic pension income 
changes in the discount rate  rate of compensation increase and cash balance accumulation conversion rates also have an impact on our annual operating income 
these three rates are assumed to move in proportion to each other and are adjusted yearly  based on the factors noted above 
we lowered these rates by three quarters of a percentage point each in connection with the calculation of our pension obligations as of december  for example  we lowered the discount rate to from used at december  we expect that this three quarter percentage point decrease in all of the discount rate  rate of compensation increase and cash balance accumulation conversion rate applied with respect to the us qualified and non qualified plans will increase our annual operating income by approximately million by increasing our net periodic pension income 
changes in assumed health care cost trend rates also have an impact on our annual operating income by changing our net periodic postretirement benefit cost 
a one percentage point increase in the health care cost trend rate decreases our annual operating income by approximately million  while a one percentage point decrease in the rate increases annual operating income by approximately the same amount 
differences between the assumptions stated above and actual experience could affect our pension and other postretirement benefit costs 
when actual plan experience differs from the assumptions used  actuarial gains or losses arise in accordance with sfas no 
and sfas no 
these gains and losses are aggregated and amortized over the average future service periods of employees to the extent that such gains or losses exceed a corridor as defined in sfas no 
the purpose of the corridor is to average the volatility caused by the difference between actual experience and the pension related assumptions noted above  on a plan by plan basis 
for all of our pension plans  total unrecognized actuarial losses as of december  was million  of which million was attributable to the us qualified plan  million was attributable to the us non qualified plans  and the remainder was attributable to the non us pension plans 
we do not expect to recognize in our net periodic pension cost any of the unrecognized loss attributable to the us qualified plan  as this loss is unlikely to exceed the corridor threshold under sfas no 
for each of the us non qualified plans and us plans  we expect to recognize losses in our net periodic pension cost of approximately million and million  respectively 
this represents an aggregate increased cost from of approximately million 
differences between the expected long term rate of return assumption and actual experience could affect our net periodic pension cost 
we recorded net periodic income for our pension plans of million  million and million for the years  and  respectively 
this income was driven principally by the expected return on plan assets  which was million in the million was determined by multiplying the expected long term rate of return assumption by the market related value of plan assets 
the market related value of plan assets recognizes asset gains and losses over five years to average the effects of short term market fluctuations on net periodic cost 
in  we incurred million of investment losses in our pension plans  of which million was attributable to the us qualified plan 
at january   the market related value of our us qualified plan was  million  which excludes million of deferred investment losses from prior periods that will reduce the market related value in future years 
the million of deferred losses includes million of the million investment losses incurred in the remainder of the investment losses  or million  was included in the january  market related value 
if the deferred losses are not recovered in future years  our market related value of assets will decrease  causing our expected return on plan assets and our net periodic pension income to fall 
changes in the funded status of our us qualified plan could result in a significant future charge to our equity 
the excess of the fair value of plan assets over the related accumulated benefit obligation was million at december   compared with million at december  if the plan assets experience an investment loss greater than million in  the discount rate remains at 
table of contents and we make no contributions  the plan asset value may fall below the related accumulated benefit obligation 
if such an event takes place  under the requirements of sfas no 
 we would be required to record a minimum pension liability for the deficient amount and reverse our prepaid pension cost  net of applicable deferred taxes 
this charge would be recorded against a component of shareholders equity 
the prepaid pension cost associated with the us qualified plan was million at december  a change in the discount rate assumption could result in a change in the funded status of our pension plans by changing the amount of the accumulated benefit obligation 
for the us qualified plan  a one percentage point increase in the discount rate reduces our accumulated benefit obligation by approximately million  and a one percentage point decrease increases our accumulated benefit obligation by the same amount 
for the non qualified plans  a one percentage point increase in the discount rate reduces our accumulated benefit obligation by approximately million  and a one percentage point decrease increases our accumulated benefit obligation by the same amount 
changes in the assumed health care trend rates would result in a change in the postretirement benefit obligation 
a one percentage point increase in the assumed health care trend rate increases our postretirement benefit obligation by approximately million  and a one percentage point decrease reduces our postretirement benefit obligation by approximately the same amount 
for information on pension plan contribution requirements  please see future liquidity sources and uses of funds pension plan contribution requirements on page also see note to our consolidated financial statements for more information regarding costs of  and assumptions for  our pension and postretirement benefit obligations 
contingencies and litigation we establish reserves in connection with tax and legal proceedings  claims and litigation when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss is reasonably estimable 
disclosure is required when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will exceed the recorded provision 
contingent liabilities are often resolved over long periods of time 
estimating probable losses requires analyses of multiple forecasts that often depend on judgments about potential actions by third parties and regulators 
this is an inherently subjective and complex process  and actual results may differ from our estimates by material amounts

overall  during the latter half of and throughout  the weak global economy adversely impacted our business 
in general  our customers have tended to spend less 
they took longer to make purchasing decisions  thus causing us to spend more time closing sales 
this in turn caused our sales resources to spend less time on new prospects  which may adversely impact our ability to generate sales in the first half of in addition  some of our customers have gone out of business or combined with other companies 
when companies combine  their level of post consolidation spending on our products is often less than their pre consolidation spending 
in addition  the number of new credit applications  which is a major driver of demand in our risk management solutions business  has been depressed as a result of a lower level of business activity 
in a weak economy  customers increasingly look to free or lower cost information available from alternate sources including  the internet 
finally  companies are streamlining their credit departments  thus reducing the number of users of our risk management solutions products and  in some cases  product usage 
we expect these trends to continue throughout  although the impact on revenue is difficult to predict 
vs 
as noted above in the discussion of vs 
 during the latter half of  the weak global economy impacted our business 
total revenue declined million  or  primarily due to the dispositions during of our receivable management services business and certain other businesses within apla 
in addition  core revenue declined million  or  due to a adverse effect of movements in foreign exchange rates 
on a product line basis  our core revenue results reflect a million  or  decline in risk management solutions  including two percentage points of decline due to adverse movements in foreign exchange rates 
traditional risk management solutions declined compared with  while our value added risk management solutions grew  both before the effects of foreign exchange 
a million decline  or essentially no change  in sales marketing solutions  reflecting one percentage point of decline due to adverse movements in foreign exchange rates 
traditional sales marketing solutions declined compared with  and our value added sales marketing solutions grew  both before the effects of foreign exchange 
the decline in sales marketing revenue reflects the adverse effect of the global economic slowdown  the events of september and the subsequent anthrax scare on our customers spending  partially offset by the addition of imarket and harris infosource to our traditional sales marketing solutions business in the second and third quarters of  respectively 
a million  or  decline in supply management solutions both before and after the effects of foreign exchange 

table of contents consolidated operating costs the following table presents our consolidated operating costs and operating income for the years ended december   and amounts in millions operating expenses selling and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization restructuring charges net reorganization costs operating costs operating income as described above in how we manage our business  when we evaluate the performance of our business as a whole  we focus on our operating income and  therefore  our operating costs before non core gains and charges  since we do not view these items as reflecting our underlying business performance 
we have identified under the caption non core gains and charges below such gains and charges that are included in the following discussion of our gaap results 
operating expenses decreased from to and from to as headcount in the data collection  fulfillment and technology areas decreased 
this decrease was also affected by the following charges included in operating expenses a million charge for write off of capitalized software associated with products and internal use systems no longer in use million  write down of customer lists in europe million  lease and contract termination costs and miscellaneous other costs million  a million write off of assets lost in the world trade center attack  and a million impairment write down in the fourth quarter of for our murray hill  new jersey  facility  which was sold during the second quarter of selling and administrative expenses declined from to and from to administrative cost savings such as lower compensation costs achieved through our financial flexibility program were partially offset by spending on advertising to reinvigorate the d b brand  training and hiring new leaders  additions to our sales force  and transition costs incurred in implementing our financial flexibility program 
transition costs were million in  million in and million in we had net pension income of million in  million in and million in we consider this amount to be part of our compensation costs and  therefore  net pension income is included in operating expenses and in selling and administrative expenses  based upon the classification of the underlying compensation costs 
we expect lower interest rates and lower long term returns on our pension plan assets in the future and  as a result  we will change the assumptions that will be used in the calculation of our pension income for we expect pension income will be approximately million lower in than in  including the impact of the changes in these assumptions 
see the discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates pension and postretirement benefit obligations  above  and note to our consolidated financial statements 
depreciation and amortization decreased from to and from to the decrease in resulted from the write off and sale of certain assets in in connection with our financial flexibility program  and the impact of no longer amortizing goodwill in  which reduced amortization expense by million compared with see note to our consolidated financial 
table of contents statements 
the decrease in from was largely driven by lower capitalized spending during compared with earlier years and also from the write off and sale of certain assets during we have incurred charges related to our financial flexibility program in each of the past three years 
during the second quarter of  we recognized a million charge in connection with the third phase of the program 
the charge included million for severance related to approximately  employees  million for the write off of assets that were sold or abandoned including million from the outsourcing action discussed below  and million for lease termination obligations 
as part of this third phase of our financial flexibility program  we outsourced certain technology functions to computer sciences corporation csc 
under the terms of the agreement  approximately d b employees who performed data center operations  technology help desk and network management functions in the united states and in the united kingdom were transitioned to csc 
in addition  as part of the agreement  csc acquired our data center and print mail facility located in berkeley heights  new jersey  and related assets for million  which we considered the fair value for the assets 
this resulted in the million impairment loss noted above 
during the second quarter of  we incurred a million restructuring charge to re engineer administrative functions and institute common business practices worldwide  comprised of million for severance costs related to approximately employees  million for lease termination obligations and million for the write off of assets that were abandoned in the consolidation of offices  primarily in europe 
during  we also reversed million of the charge taken in related to the first phase of our financial flexibility program 
we determined that severance for people would not be utilized  due to higher than anticipated voluntary attrition million  and the remaining lease termination obligations would be lower than originally estimated as a result of more favorable market conditions and higher than anticipated sub lease rent million 
during  we incurred a million charge related to the implementation of our first phase of our financial flexibility program to globalize administrative functions  streamline data collection and fulfillment  rationalize sales and marketing functions and consolidate and simplify technology functions 
the charge included million for severance related to approximately employees  million for lease termination obligations for office closures in north america and europe and million for the write off of assets that were abandoned or impaired 
as of december   we have terminated approximately  of the  employees affected under all three phases of our financial flexibility program  including the approximately employees who were transitioned to csc  as mentioned above 
by june   approximately additional employees worldwide will be terminated in connection with the third phase 
this will bring the total number of employees reduced from our core business as a result of the three phases of this program  since its inception in october  to approximately  reflecting the elimination of  positions including open positions 
it is difficult to predict the impact of our financial flexibility program on our future operating results 
this is because we regularly revisit our decisions regarding how much of the initially identified cost savings to reallocate to other areas of the business to drive revenue growth 
these reallocation decisions depend on the performance of our existing revenue growth investments  our forecasts for future revenue growth and an assessment of the demand for our products  given economic conditions and the competitive environment 
we incurred reorganization costs in connection with our separation from moody s in in  we recognized million of reorganization costs and  in  we reversed million of excess reorganization costs

however  it was stabilized in as a result of our investments in database expansion  improving our match rate and product enhancements 
these investments have mitigated the following trends which continue to affect us a decline in new credit applications due to the economic slowdown  streamlined credit departments  resulting in fewer actual users of our products  pricing pressures from some of our larger customers  the substitution of less expensive consumer credit information for making some decisions about new credit applications from small businesses  the substitution of free or less expensive demographic information that can be obtained over the internet for our business information reports  or birs  and our intentional migration of our customers from the bir and related products to our value added solutions to assist them in re engineering their processes and automating their decision making 
the performance of our value added products also reflected the benefits of our investments  particularly in those products that provide insight on new credit applications for smaller transactions  and in our customers portfolio management processes

project related solutions  such as value added sales marketing solutions and supply management solutions  which some customers have viewed as more discretionary in a challenging economy  were also affected

the following factors affecting our european business create particular challenges to our revenue growth in most european markets  we do not have market leadership positions 
this makes us particularly susceptible to pricing pressures 
we also face entrenched local competitors 
european businesses tend to manage their credit exposures through credit insurance rather than through the credit approval process using expert business information of the type provided by d b 
in many local markets in europe  key data elements are generally available from public sector sources thus reducing our data collection advantage 
prior to the launch of our blueprint for growth strategy  our investment decisions were made at the country level and not in a coordinated fashion across the european marketplace 
while we have made significant investments to mitigate this situation  we are still faced with uneven data quality in some local markets 
despite declining revenue  europe s operating income grew million  or  in to million  primarily due to the lower cost base associated with our financial flexibility program

table of contents market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes  foreign currency fluctuations and changes in the market value of certain of our investments 
policies and procedures in the normal course of business  we employ established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates and foreign currencies 
we use short term foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge short term foreign currency denominated loans and certain intercompany transactions and  from time to time  we have used foreign exchange option contracts to reduce our international earnings exposure to adverse changes in currency exchange rates 
in addition  we use interest rate swap agreements to hedge a portion of the interest rate exposure on our outstanding fixed rate notes  as discussed under interest rate risk  below 
our objective in managing exposure to interest rates is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings  cash flows and financial position  and to lower overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we maintain a policy that floating rate debt be managed within a minimum and maximum range of our total debt exposure 
to achieve our policy objectives  we may use fixed rate debt  floating rate debt and or interest rate swaps 
our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce the volatility caused by foreign exchange rate changes on the earnings  cash flows and financial position of our european and apla operations 
we follow a policy of hedging substantially all balance sheet positions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency applicable to each of our various subsidiaries 
from time to time  we may also hedge the value of our foreign currency denominated earnings 
we use short term foreign exchange forward and option contracts to implement our hedging strategies 
typically  these contracts have maturities of six months or less 
these contracts are executed with creditworthy institutions and are denominated primarily in the british pound sterling  the euro and the swedish krona 
a discussion of our accounting policies for financial instruments is included in the summary of significant accounting policies in note to our consolidated financial statements  and further disclosure relating to financial instruments is included in note to our consolidated financial statements 
interest rate risk in  we issued million in principal of five year  fixed rate notes that mature in march see note to our consolidated financial statements 
in connection with that note issuance  we entered into fixed to floating interest rate swap agreements in the third quarter of with notional principal amounts totaling million see note to our consolidated financial statements  and designated these swaps as fair value hedges against the long term fixed rate notes 
the arrangement is considered a highly effective hedge and  therefore  the accounting for these hedges has no impact on earnings 
the changes in the fair value of the hedge and the designated portion of the notes are reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 
at december   we had no floating rate debt outstanding 
foreign exchange risk we have offices in countries and conduct operations in eight other countries through companies in which we have minority investments 
our non us operations generated approximately of total revenue in as of december   approximately of our assets were located outside the us  and no single country outside the us had a significant concentration of our aggregate cash balances 
as in prior years  we have hedged substantially all balance sheet positions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency applicable to each of our various subsidiaries with short term forward foreign exchange contracts 
in addition  in  we entered into foreign exchange option contracts to hedge certain foreign earnings 
these option contracts have expired as of december  the underlying transactions and the corresponding forward rate and option contracts are marked to market at 
table of contents the end of each quarter  are fully disclosed within our financial statements and have a minimal impact on earnings 
the fair value of our foreign currency risk is estimated by calculating the cost of closing out all foreign exchange contracts given a increase or decrease in forward rates from their december   levels 
at december   we had approximately million in foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding  with net unrealized losses of million 
if forward rates were to increase from year end levels  the unrealized gain would be million 
if forward rates were to decrease from year end levels  the unrealized loss would be million 
however  the estimated potential gain or loss on these contracts is expected to be offset by changes in the dollar value of the underlying transactions 
therefore  a movement in foreign exchange rates would have a minimal net impact on earnings 
other risks see note to our consolidated financial statements liquidity and financial position in accordance with our blueprint for growth strategy  we have used our cash for three primary purposes first  we have invested in our current business  such as the investments in our database and creating new products and solutions such as our global decisionmaker tm  data integration toolkit tm and supply optimizer tm see item business our competitive strengths value added solutions for product descriptions

this investment is in addition to shares we repurchased to offset the dilutive effect of shares issued in connection with employee benefit plans 
we expect to continue to repurchase shares for this purpose  as well as under our two year  million share repurchase program

also  immediately prior to the separation  a portion of d b s indebtedness plus certain minority interest obligations and a portion of d b s cash were allocated to us in amounts such that  at the time of the separation and before giving effect to certain adjustments and other factors described in note to our consolidated financial statements  our net indebtedness plus the minority interest obligations approximated the net indebtedness of moody s 
the indebtedness that we assumed amounted to million 
we also assumed million in minority interest obligations and were allocated million in cash 
the debt that was assumed by moody s amounted to million 
during  million was used to repay commercial paper borrowings 
as noted above  in  we used million to repurchase shares of common stock and received net proceeds from our stock plans of million 
between january   and september   d b repurchased  shares of common stock for million in connection with its employee stock purchase plan and to offset a portion of the shares issued under stock incentive plans 
during the fourth quarter of  we repurchased million shares of common stock for million to offset awards under stock incentive plans and in connection with our employee stock purchase plan 
proceeds received in connection with d b s stock plans were million for the nine months ended 
table of contents september  we received proceeds in connection with our stock plans of million in the fourth quarter of future liquidity sources and uses of funds contractual cash obligations the following table quantifies as of december   our contractual obligations that will require the use of cash in the future 
payments due by period contractual obligations total thereafter amounts in millions long term debt operating leases obligations to outsourcers our million debt obligation under our fixed rate notes is repayable in march most of our operations are conducted from leased facilities under operating leases that expire over the next years  with the majority expiring within five years 
we also lease certain computer and other equipment under operating leases that expire over the next three years 
these leases are frequently renegotiated or otherwise changed as advancements in computer technology produce opportunities to lower costs and improve performance 
in july  we outsourced certain technology functions to csc under a year agreement  which is cancelable under certain conditions 
under the terms of the agreement  csc will be responsible for our data center operations  technology help desk and network management functions in the united states and in the united kingdom through july  acquisition of hoover s on march   we completed the acquisition of hoover s 
the transaction was valued at per share in cash  for a total of approximately million  or million net of hoover s cash and short term investments at the time of the transaction s closing 
hoover s provides industry and market intelligence on public and private companies  primarily to sales  marketing and business development professionals 
for the nine months ended december   the latest period for which publicly filed information is available  hoover s reported revenue of million  net income of million and cash from operating activities of million 
we funded the acquisition with cash on hand 
financial flexibility program in january  we announced the fourth phase of our financial flexibility program 
the actions associated with this phase  which will be implemented during the first half of  include continuing to streamline sales and marketing functions  consolidate data operations  and reallocate technology spending to products with greater growth potential 
under this phase  approximately people worldwide are expected to have their positions eliminated by july as a result  we expect to incur restructuring charges recognized in accordance with sfas no 
in totaling approximately million pre tax  for severance and termination costs 
in addition  cash restructuring payments with respect to prior phases of our financial flexibility program are expected to be approximately million in share repurchases and dividends during october  we announced that our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to million  funded with cash on hand and future cash flow 
this two year program is in addition to our existing share repurchase program to offset the dilutive effect of shares issued under 
table of contents employee benefit plans 
at current market prices  this represents approximately of shares outstanding 
no shares under the million program were repurchased as of december   although through february   we repurchased  shares at an aggregate cost of million 
at current market prices  when we complete this program  we will have reduced shares outstanding by over since the beginning of we have not paid cash dividends since we separated from moody s in however  if there is a change in the tax deductibility of dividends under us tax laws  we may consider paying dividends as an alternative method of returning excess cash to shareholders 
the sale of our european headquarters building in we are currently in negotiations to sell our european headquarters building in high wycombe  england 
we intend to continue operations from a portion of the building for a multi year period after the sale 
if the sale is completed in accordance with the terms as currently negotiated  we expect to recognize a pre tax loss of approximately million  and receive an amount of cash that  due to a confidentiality agreement  cannot be disclosed until the transaction is closed 
potential payments in settlement of tax and legal matters we and our predecessors are involved in certain tax and legal proceedings  claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business 
these matters are at various stages of resolution  but could ultimately result in cash payments in the amounts described in item legal proceedings  above 
of the matters currently pending  we believe it is possible that a payment to the irs of up to million in connection with the royalty expense deductions taken in  will be made during we believe we have adequate reserves recorded in our consolidated financial statements for our share of current exposures in tax matters 
pension plan contribution requirements for financial statement reporting purposes  the funded status of our pension plans  as determined in accordance with gaap  declined from million at december   to million at december   primarily due to losses in the plans equity investments and lower interest rates 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
the decline in the funded status is primarily attributable to the largest of our six plans  the us qualified plan 
the funded status of this plan declined from million at december   to million at december  despite this change in funded status as determined in accordance with gaap  the internal revenue service regulations that govern pension plan contributions do not require any contributions to this plan for this is because the plan is considered fully funded under the provisions of the internal revenue code 
if the us qualified plan assets remain at current levels  and all other factors affecting when contributions are required remain the same  we would not be required to make contributions to this plan until if plan assets appreciate between now and  the need to make a required contribution would be delayed beyond if plan assets depreciate  we could be required to make contributions sooner than in addition  if the us congress does not renew the provision in effect for and governing the current liability interest rate used in calculating the additional funding requirement under the internal revenue code  we could be required to make contributions starting in whether or not contributions are required  we may voluntarily make contributions to this plan sooner than  if allowable under internal revenue code funding provisions 
we expect to continue to make cash contributions to our five other pension plans in the expected contribution amount is approximately million  compared with approximately million in 
table of contents off balance sheet arrangements and related party transactions we do not have any transactions  obligations or relationships that could be considered off balance sheet arrangements 
additionally  we have not engaged in any significant related party transactions 
forward looking statements we may from time to time make written or oral forward looking statements  including statements contained in filings with the securities and exchange commission  in reports to shareholders and in press releases and investor webcasts 
you can identify these forward looking statements by use of words like anticipates  aspirations  believes  continues  estimates  expects  goals  guidance  intends  plans  projects  strategy  targets  will and other words of similar meaning 
you can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts 
we cannot guarantee that any forward looking statement will be realized  although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions 
achievement of future results is subject to risks  uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions 
should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize  or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate  actual results could vary materially from those anticipated  estimated or projected 
investors should bear this in mind as they consider forward looking statements and whether to invest in  or remain invested in  our securities 
in connection with the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of  we are identifying in the following paragraphs important factors that  individually or in the aggregate  could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements made by us  any such statement is qualified by reference to the following cautionary statements 
demand for our products is subject to intense competition  changes in customer preferences and economic conditions 
our results are dependent upon our continued ability to develop new products  invest in our database and maintain our reputation for providing reliable data  develop and maintain a successful web based business model  reallocate expense to achieve growth through our financial flexibility program  manage employee satisfaction and maintain our global expertise as we implement our financial flexibility program  and protect against damage or interruptions affecting our database or our data centers 
we are also subject to the effects of foreign economies  exchange rate fluctuations and us and foreign legislative or regulatory requirements 
our results are also dependent upon the availability of data for our database 
developments in any of these areas could cause our results to differ materially from results that have been or may be projected 
we elaborate on the above list of important factors throughout this document  particularly in the discussion of our prominent trends  risks and uncertainties  below 
you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors 
consequently  you should not consider the above list of important factors or the trends  risks and uncertainties discussed below to be a complete discussion of all our potential trends  risks and uncertainties 
we do not undertake to update any forward looking statement we may make from time to time 
trends  risks and uncertainties if the current economic weakness persists or worsens  our results of operations may suffer 
demand for many of our products is influenced by economic trends 
as a result of the current economic climate  during the last two fiscal years we experienced a reduction in the demand for certain of our products as customers have looked for ways to reduce their expenses 
the effect of this reduced 
table of contents demand was felt most acutely in our project based revenue in our sales marketing solutions product line in the united states in and in europe in new credit applications  which are the major driver of product demand in our traditional risk management solutions  have also been depressed as a result of lower levels of business activity 
the current economic weakness has also resulted in certain of our customers going out of business or combining with other companies 
when companies combine  their post consolidation spend on our products is invariably less than their aggregate pre consolidation spend 
in addition  companies are streamlining their credit departments  thus reducing the number of users of our products 
customers have also been taking longer to make spending decisions  causing us to expend greater resources and divert sales resources from other opportunities  negotiating harder on price and seeking cheaper alternatives to our products 
in challenging economic times  price competition also increases  which adversely impacts our revenue and profit margins 
the current economic weakness may persist or worsen for an unpredictable period of time 
if it does  we could suffer lower revenue  net income and earnings per share 
we may be unable to achieve our revenue and earnings per share growth targets 
we have established revenue and earnings per share growth targets for and aspirations for the long term 
while we believe our initiatives to transform our business have established a platform to reach these goals  we have not yet attained our revenue growth goals 
in order to reach our goals  we are undertaking a number of initiatives to increase our revenue in each of our product lines 
for example  in our risk management solutions product line  we are introducing products targeted at helping our customers automate their decision making process for small size transactions and strengthening our offerings of portfolio management solutions 
while we believe that our initiatives in each product line will be sufficient to achieve our desired revenue growth  no assurance can be made as to when or if we will be successful 
a failure to reach our desired revenue growth or to continue to reach our earnings per share growth could have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock 
we may be unable to reduce our expense base through our financial flexibility program or convert those expense base reductions into desired revenue growth 
successful execution of our blueprint for growth strategy will include reducing our expense base through our financial flexibility program  and reallocating our expense base reductions into initiatives that produce our desired revenue growth 
while we have been successful at reducing our expense base to date  we have yet to convert those expense base reductions into our desired level of revenue growth 
if we fail to continue to reduce our expense base or if we do not convert our expense base reductions into revenue growth  the market value of our common stock may suffer 
we may be unable to successfully adapt to changes in our customers preferences for our products 
our success depends in part on our ability to adapt our products to our customers preferences 
advances in information technology and uncertain or difficult economic conditions are changing the way our customers use business information 
as a result  our customers are demanding lower prices and more from our products  such as decision making tools like credit scores and electronic delivery formats 
for example  our customers have recently been switching from our traditional products such as the business information report  or bir  which generally offer raw information  to other lower priced products that offer credit ratings and decisions 
if we do not successfully adapt our products to our customers preferences  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 
we may not be able to develop the e business component of our strategy 
one component of our blueprint for growth strategy is to become an important player on the web 
to implement this component  we are transitioning our business to a web based business model 
there are risks associated with a web based business model 
some of the risks are unique to our planned 
table of contents initiatives and others apply to any web based business 
for example  our business will suffer if we are unable to acquire  retain and grow web based small business customers  successfully grow the hoover s business  develop products that are understandable and easy to use over the web  minimize disruptions in our service and other system failures that reduce customer satisfaction  and minimize difficulties that delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and marketing of our web based products 
we face competition that may cause price reductions or loss of market share 
we are subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our business 
we compete directly with a broad range of companies offering business information services to customers 
recently  we have faced increased competition from consumer credit companies that offer products that combine consumer information with business information as a tool in helping their customers make credit decisions with respect to small businesses 
we also face competition from the in house operations of the businesses we seek as customers  other general and specialized credit reporting and other business information services  other information and professional service providers  and credit insurers 
in addition  business information products and services are becoming increasingly available  principally as a result of the expansion of the internet and as new providers of business information products and services emerge 
weak economic conditions have resulted in customers seeking to utilize free or lower cost information that is available from alternative sources such as the internet 
intense competition could harm us by causing  among other things  price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share 
our operations in europe and in other regions outside the united states are subject to various risks associated with operations in foreign countries 
our success depends in part on our various operations outside the united states 
our european segment accounted for of our total revenue in our business in europe is subject to many challenges  the most significant being we do not have market leadership positions in most european countries  making us particularly susceptible to pricing pressures  our competition is primarily local  and our customers may have greater loyalty to our local competitors  credit insurance is a significant credit risk mitigation tool in many european markets  thus reducing the demand for information based credit risk mitigation tools  such as those offered by us  in many local markets in europe  key data elements are generally available from public sector sources  thus reducing our data collection advantage  and prior to the launch of our blueprint for growth strategy in october  our investment decisions were made at the country level and not in a coordinated fashion across the european marketplace 
while we have made significant investments to mitigate this situation  we are still faced with uneven data quality in some local european markets 
our operating results could also be negatively affected by a variety of other factors affecting our foreign operations  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include currency fluctuations  economic  political or regulatory conditions in a specific country or region  trade protection measures and 
table of contents other regulatory requirements 
additional risks inherent in our non us business activities generally include  among others longer accounts receivable payment cycles  the costs and difficulties of managing international operations  and greater difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights 
we may lose key business assets  including loss of data center capacity or the interruption of telecommunications links or power sources 
our operations depend on our ability  as well as that of third party service providers to whom we have outsourced several critical functions  to protect our data centers and related technology against damage from fire  power loss  telecommunications failure or other disasters 
the on line services we provide are dependent on links to telecommunications providers 
we believe reasonable precautions are in place to protect our data centers and telecommunications links from events that could interrupt operations 
nonetheless  any damage to our data centers or any failure of our telecommunications links that causes interruptions in operations could materially adversely affect our ability to meet customers requirements  which could result in decreased revenue  net income and earnings per share 
we are dependent upon third parties for certain services 
as part of our financial flexibility program  we have outsourced various functions  including certain of our data center operations and certain development functions 
if one of the third party providers were to experience financial or operational difficulties  their services to us may suffer 
changes in the legislative  regulatory and commercial environments may adversely affect our ability to collect  manage  aggregate and use data 
certain data and services we provide are subject to regulation by federal  state and local authorities in the united states  canada  europe and certain countries within the asia pacific and latin america regions 
in addition  there is increasing awareness and concern among the general public regarding marketing and privacy concerns  particularly as they relate to consumer privacy and the internet 
this concern is likely to result in new laws and regulations 
compliance with existing federal  state and local laws and regulations has not to date seriously affected our business  financial condition or results of operations 
nonetheless  future international  federal  state and local laws and regulations with respect to the collection  management and use of data  and adverse publicity or potential litigation concerning the commercial use of such information  may increasingly affect our operations 
this could result in substantial regulatory compliance or litigation expense or a loss of revenue 
data suppliers might withdraw data from us  leading to our inability to provide products and services 
we obtain much of the data that we use from third parties  direct contact with businesses through our call centers and by purchasing data from public record sources 
we could suffer a material adverse effect if owners of the data we use were to withdraw the data or cease making the data available 
data providers could withdraw their data or cease making it available if there is a competitive reason to do so or if legislation is passed restricting the use of the data 
if a substantial number of data providers were to withdraw their data or cease making it available  our ability to provide products and services to our customers could be materially adversely impacted  which could result in decreased revenue  net income and earnings per share 
we rely on annual contract renewals 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenue from annual customer contracts 
if we are unable to renew a significant number of these contracts  our revenue and results of operations would be harmed 
we could be harmed by a failure in the integrity of our database 
the reliability of our products is dependent upon the integrity of the data in our global database 
we have in the past been subject to customer and third party inquiries  complaints and lawsuits regarding our 
table of contents data  including claims based on theories of negligence and libel 
a failure in the integrity of our database could harm us by exposing us to customer or third party claims or by causing a loss of customer confidence in our products 
our workforce reductions may adversely affect employee satisfaction and our operations 
we have reduced our workforce as part of our financial flexibility program  and we may continue to reduce our workforce as part of this program in the future 
these actions may reduce employee satisfaction  and we may lose employees we would prefer to retain 
we are involved in tax and legal proceedings that could have a material effect on us 
we are involved in tax and legal proceedings  claims and litigation that arise in the ordinary course of business 
as discussed in greater detail under item legal proceedings above  certain of these matters could have a material effect on our results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
acquisitions may disrupt or otherwise have a negative impact on our business 
as part of our strategy  we may seek to acquire other complementary businesses  products and technologies 
we recently completed the acquisition of hoover s  inc the hoover s and other future acquisitions are subject to the following risks acquisitions may cause a disruption in our ongoing business  distract our management and make it difficult to maintain our standards  controls and procedures  we may not be able to integrate successfully the services  content  products and personnel of any acquisition into our operations  and we may not derive the revenue improvements  cost savings and other intended benefits of any acquisition
