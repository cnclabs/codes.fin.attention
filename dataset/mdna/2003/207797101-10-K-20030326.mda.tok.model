item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition overview connecticut water service  inc the company or ctws is a non operating holding company  whose income is derived from the earnings of its eleven wholly owned subsidiary companies 
in  approximately of the company s earnings were attributable to water activities carried out within its five regulated water companies the connecticut water company  the gallup water service  incorporated  the crystal water company of danielson  the barnstable water company and the unionville water company 
these five companies supply water to  customers in towns throughout connecticut and massachusetts 
each of these companies is subject to state regulation regarding financial issues  rates  and operating issues  and to various other state and federal regulatory agencies concerning water quality and environmental standards 
in addition to its regulated utilities  the company owns six unregulated companies chester realty  inc  a real estate company in connecticut  new england water utility services  inc  which provides contract water and sewer operations and other water related services  connecticut water emergency services  inc  a provider of drinking and pool water by tanker truck  crystal water utilities corporation  a holding company which owns the crystal water company of danielson and three small rental properties  barlaco  a real estate company in massachusetts  and barnstable holding company  a holding company which owns the barnstable water company and barlaco 
in  these unregulated companies  in conjunction with the regulated water companies  contributed the remaining of ctws earnings through real estate transactions as well as services and rentals 
was the company s th consecutive year of increased earnings and its rd consecutive year of increased dividend payments  excluding dividends paid by companies subsequently acquired and accounted for under the pooling of interests method 
regulatory matters and inflation the connecticut water company is the company s largest subsidiary serving over  of the company s  utility customers 
connecticut water company s revenues  like the company s other four regulated water companies  are based on regulated rates that are determined in a regulatory rate proceeding 
connecticut water s last general rate proceeding was in the resulting rate decision granted connecticut water a allowed return on common equity and a allowed return on rate base 
the company  like all other businesses  is affected by inflation  most notably by the continually increasing costs required to maintain  improve and expand its service capability 
the cumulative effect of inflation results in significantly higher facility replacement costs  which must be recovered from future cash flows 
the ability of the company s water utility subsidiaries to recover this increased investment in facilities is primarily dependent upon future rate increases  which are subject to state regulatory approval 
we do not presently plan to request rate relief for any of our regulated companies 
future economic and financial market conditions  coupled with governmental regulations and fiscal policy  plus other factors that are unpredictable and often beyond our control  will influence when we request revisions to rates charged to our customers 
the company is also subject to environmental and water quality regulations 
costs to comply with environmental and water quality regulations are substantial 
we are currently in compliance with current regulations  but the regulations are subject to change at any time 
the costs to comply with future changes in state or federal regulations  which could require us to modify current filtration facilities and or construct new ones  or to replace any reduction of the safe yield from any of our current sources of supply  could be substantial 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap and as directed by the regulatory commissions to which the company s subsidiaries are subject 
see note for a discussion of our significant accounting policies 
the company believes the following policies are critical to the presentation of its consolidated financial statements 
public utility regulation statement of financial accounting standards financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation fas  requires cost based  rate regulated enterprises such as the company s water companies to reflect the impact of regulatory decisions in their financial statements 
the state regulators  through the rate regulation process  can create regulatory assets that result when costs are allowed for ratemaking purposes in a period after the period in which costs would be charged to expense by an unregulated enterprise 
the balance sheet includes regulatory assets and liabilities as appropriate  primarily related to income taxes and post retirement benefit costs 
the company believes  based on current regulatory circumstances  that the regulatory assets recorded are likely to be recovered and that its use of regulatory accounting is appropriate and in accordance with the provisions of fas material regulatory assets are earning a return 
revenue recognition revenue from metered customers includes billings to customers based on quarterly meter readings plus an estimate of water used between the customer s last meter reading and the end of the accounting period 
the unbilled revenue amount is listed as a current asset on the balance sheet 
the amount recorded as unbilled revenue is generally higher during the summer months when water sales are higher 
based upon historical experience  management believes the company s estimate of unbilled revenues is reasonable 
outlook the company s profitability is primarily attributable to the sale and distribution of water  the amount of which is dependent on seasonal weather fluctuations  particularly during the summer months when water demand will vary with rainfall and temperature levels 
after the terrorist strike on september   water companies have had to increase security on their water supplies and facilities 
this has resulted in increases in operating and capital costs related to security  which are typically recoverable in a rate proceeding 
the company has received regulatory approval to donate certain parcels of its land in the years and over the two year period these donations are expected to contribute approximately million to net income as a result of favorable tax treatment under federal and connecticut tax laws 
liquidity and capital resources the company is not aware of demands  events or uncertainties that will result in a decrease of liquidity or a material change in the mix or relative cost of capital resources 
the company does not use off balance sheet arrangements such as securitization of receivables or unconsolidated entities 
the company has no material lease obligations  does not engage in trading or risk management activities and does not have material transactions involving related parties 
interim bank loans payable at year end was  which is  higher than at the end of we consider the current  lines of credit with three banks adequate to finance any expected short term borrowing requirements that may arise from operations during in may   of the lines of credit expire and the remaining  expires in may we expect the lines of credit to be renewed 
interest expense charged on interim bank loans will fluctuate based on financial market conditions 
during  the company incurred approximately million of construction expenditures 
the company financed such expenditures through internally generated funds  customers advances  contributions in aid of construction and short term borrowings 
the board of directors has approved a million construction budget for  net of amounts to be financed by customer advances and contributions in aid of construction 
funds primarily provided by operating activities are expected to finance this entire construction program given normal weather patterns and related operating revenue billings

forward looking information this report  including management s discussion and analysis  contains certain forward looking statements regarding the company s results of operations and financial position 
these forward looking statements are based on current information and expectations  and are subject to risks and uncertainties  which could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from expected results 
our water companies are subject to various federal and state regulatory agencies concerning water quality and environmental standards 
generally  the water industry is materially dependent on the adequacy of approved rates to allow for a fair rate of return on the investment in utility plant 
the ability to maintain our operating costs at the lowest possible level  while providing good quality water service  is beneficial to customers and stockholders 
profitability is also dependent on the timeliness of rate relief  when necessary  and numerous factors over which we have little or no control  such as the quantity of rainfall and temperature  industrial demand  financing costs  energy rates  tax rates  and stock market trends which may affect the return earned on pension assets  and compliance with environmental and water quality regulations 
we undertake no obligation to update or revise forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events  or otherwise
