item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations background fuel tech nv the company operates primarily in the air pollution control business 
it distributes its products through its direct sales force  licensees and agents 
principal markets for its products are stationary combustion sources that produce nitrogen oxide nox and other emissions 
fuel tech sells its fuel treatment chemicals through its direct sales force and agents to industrial and utility power generation facilities 
fuel tech currently generates revenues from the following three product lines nitrogen oxide nox reduction technologies fuel tech markets several nox reduction technologies to meet statutory nox reduction requirements worldwide 
the near term driver for growth in this business is the ozone transport sip state implementation plan call  which requires states to decrease their nox emissions by may  this regulation impacts utility boilers and large industrial boilers see below for more detail on the sip call 
fuel tech believes that the implementation of the sip call will extend well beyond the may  implementation date 
fuel treatment chemicals fuel tech s proprietary targeted in furnace injection technology centers around the unique application of specialty chemicals to improve the performance of combustion units 
specifically  this technology is used to reduce slag formation  corrosion and opacity in boilers  furnaces and incinerators 
fuel tech believes its largest market opportunity for this product line is those units burning western coals  many of which have significant operational issues related to the formation of slag 
visualization software in  fuel tech introduced a software product  marketed under the acuitiv trade name that allows users to visualize in a three dimensional immersive environment  complex data sets 
the software is currently being marketed to users of computation fluid dynamics cfd software  an engineering software tool that aids users in predicting flows  such as liquid or gas streams 
fuel tech developed this software internally to make the design process of its nox reduction and fuel treatment chemical business more efficient and accurate 
fuel tech licenses this product to end users on an annual or permanent basis 
fuel tech will not record license revenue until its capitalized software development costs  with a balance of approximately  at december   are recovered 
this product was introduced in mid  and to date two licenses have been sold 
fuel tech expects demand for this product to increase in  as it recently introduced a version of the software that is compatible with the microsoft windows operating system 
fuel tech does not believe  however  that it will recognize significant revenues in from this product due to the cost recovery requirement discussed above 
versus net sales for the months ended december  and were  and  respectively 
the improvement is attributable to the increase in domestic nox reduction utility project revenues  as project bookings in the fourth quarter of and in generated revenues during their various phases of completion 
nox reduction utility revenue in had been negatively impacted by the delay in obtaining a final ruling on the environmental protection agency s epa sip state implementation plan call regulation 
as discussed further below  the uncertainty regarding this regulation has been lifted and fuel tech expects demand for its nox reduction technologies to continue to increase during the next few years 
fuel treatment chemical revenues for the twelve month period ended december  continued to be favorably impacted by shipments to utilities burning western coals 
fuel tech believes that utilities burning western coals represent the largest market opportunity for its fuel treatment chemical business and that penetration into this market is a priority 
in addition to shipments to pacificorp  fuel tech s strategic agreement partner  demonstrations with two midwestern utilities  both on coal fired units  commenced during the year 
all of these utilities are using fuel tech s patented targeted in furnace injection tifi process to control the formation of slag deposits in boilers burning western coals 
more than offsetting the improved performance in the coal fired utility segment of this market were the following two factors first  the continued deterioration in the oil fired business  as the high price of oil as compared with the price of natural gas caused customers in this segment to switch fuels  negatively impacting results 
second  the use of low slagging coal by one of fuel tech s customers caused that customer to temporarily suspend treatment 
although fuel tech believes that both factors will reverse themselves  it is not possible to predict when that will occur 
the sip call is the federal mandate that  when introduced in  required states to reduce nox emissions by may on march   an appellate court of the dc circuit upheld the validity of the sip call for of the states and  on june   the same court made a final ruling upholding the epa s sip call regulation and denying the appeal of the states and utilities 
although the nox reduction requirement date was moved back one year to may of  nineteen states were required to complete and issue their state implementation plans for nox reduction by october of these plans  which the epa had until october to approve  will potentially impact to utility boilers and to industrial units 
in february  the united states supreme court  in a unanimous decision  upheld epa s authority to revise the national ambient air quality standard for ozone to parts per million averaged through an eight hour period from the current parts per million for a one hour period 
this more stringent standard provides clarity and impetus for nox reduction efforts well beyond the current ozone attainment requirement of in keeping with this trend  the supreme court  only days later  denied industry s attempt to again stay the sip call  effectively exhausting all means of appeal 
based on these regulatory developments  fuel tech is enjoying accelerated interest in its nox reduction programs that have led to significant project bookings late in and in fuel tech anticipates continued demand for its air pollution control technologies over the next several years 
cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  for the month period ended december  was versus for the same period of the prior year 
the increase reflects a change in product mix in  in favor of the lower margin nox reduction project business 
selling  general and administrative expenses were  and  respectively  for the month periods ended december  and the increase is due primarily to revenue related expenses  as revenue increased significantly from the prior year  and secondarily to the addition of sales and marketing personnel  both for the fuel treatment chemical and acuitiv businesses 
market penetration of fuel tech s tifi technology in the coal fired utility market remains a strategic priority 
research and development expenses for the months ended december  and were  and  respectively 
fuel tech continues to pursue commercial applications for its technologies outside of its traditional markets  with a particular focus on its acuitiv software and its noxout ultra process 
the acuitiv software product was commercially introduced on june   and fuel tech recently received its second commercial order 
fuel tech recorded a loss of  for the months ended december  on its equity investment in fuel tech cs gmbh ftcs  a percent owned entity 
during the quarter ended march   fuel tech recognized a gain of  on its equity investment in clean diesel technologies  inc cdt  its percent owned affiliate 
the gain resulted from cdt s repayment of the full principal amount of loans made by fuel tech to cdt in and because of the continuing losses incurred by cdt  the carrying value of the loans was reduced to zero as of december   based on fuel tech s pro rata share of the losses incurred 
fuel tech s investment in cdt  whose shares are publicly traded on the otc bulletin board and the alternative investment market of the london stock exchange  had a market value of million at december   which is not reflected on fuel tech s balance sheet 
during the months ended december   fuel tech recognized a  loss on its equity investment in ftcs  while a loss of  was recorded on fuel tech s investment in cdt for the same period 
please refer to note of the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of related party transactions 
interest expense for the months ended december  was reduced to  from  in the prior month period 
the decrease is attributable to a reduction in the average outstanding principal balance on fuel tech s term loan  as well as to a reduction in short term interest rates 
other income and expense for the month period ended december  was  versus  for the same period in the increase stems largely from the elimination of goodwill amortization effective january   which has been offset somewhat by reductions in interest income 
an income tax benefit of  was recorded in  which represented a reduction of the reserve for prior years state income tax refunds receivable  as the related receivables were collected in no provision for federal or state income taxes was recorded in any period due to the existence of net operating loss carry forwards 
fuel tech has million in united states federal income tax loss carry forwards as of december   the deferred tax benefit of which has been offset by a valuation allowance in fuel tech s balance sheet 
in the opinion of management  fuel tech s expected near term revenue growth in its nox reduction business will be directly related to the implementation of the requirements of the caaa 
fuel tech s implementor and alliance strategies will enable fuel tech to provide the noxout process to an increasing number of customers without significantly adding technical and support staff 
customers purchase the noxout process and related technologies from either fuel tech or its implementors 
if customers purchase the noxout process from implementors  the per contract revenues to fuel tech may be lower  but more installations may be handled 
versus net sales in totaled  versus net sales of  in  a decline of 
this overall decline was due to a  year on year reduction in domestic nox reduction industrial project revenues  the basis of which is discussed further below 
this result was partially offset by two favorable factors 
first  fuel tech experienced a  increase in fuel treatment chemical revenues in versus  to a record level of  second  fuel tech realized revenues from temperature mapping and modeling activities predominantly for the domestic nox reduction utility project business in the amount of approximately  in versus an immaterial amount in the year on year decline in domestic nox reduction industrial project revenues was attributable to a nox reduction regulation  as mandated in title iii of the caaa  requiring municipal solid waste incinerators to significantly reduce their nox emissions by december  this regulation had a significant positive impact on industrial project revenues in  and it was expected that these revenues would not repeat in nox reduction utility revenue had been negatively impacted by the delay in obtaining a final ruling on the epa s sip call regulation 
the increase in fuel treatment chemical revenues was attributable to fuel tech s success in penetrating the market for utility units burning western coals  and to customers conversion from existing suppliers to fuel tech 
significant focus was placed on marketing fuel tech s patented targeted in furnace injection approach to reduce the operating costs of customers units 
in  fuel tech realized approximately  in revenues from temperature mapping and modeling orders received on boilers predominantly for the domestic nox reduction utility project business 
fuel tech s performance of temperature mapping and modeling work for a customer is the precursor to performing nox reduction project installations on the units for which the mapping and modeling has been performed 
it is fuel tech s belief that project orders will be received from the majority of customers for whom temperature mapping and modeling work has been performed 
the gross margin percentage on an overall basis across all products was in  compared with in the improvement was realized primarily due to the increase in revenues in the fuel treatment chemical business 
as nox reduction revenues from utility companies in the united states increase due to the above mentioned regulations  this business will comprise a much larger percentage of fuel tech s overall revenues 
as a result  fuel tech expects that the overall gross margin percentages will decline over the next several years  reflecting the change in product mix 
selling  general and administrative expenses were  for the twelve months ended december   an increase of  from the prior year 
the increase was due primarily to a higher level of selling and service expenses resulting from the increased agents fees and commissions for the us fuel treatment chemical business  and to a lesser extent to an increase in expenses related to the enhancement and expansion of fuel tech s european business 
research and development expenses for the twelve months ended december  and were  and  respectively 
fuel tech continued to aggressively pursue commercial applications for its technologies outside of its traditional markets  with a particular focus on its noxout ultra process and its acuitiv advanced visualization software 
fuel tech sold its first commercial demonstration of noxout ultra late in fuel tech recorded a net loss from its equity interest in affiliates during the year of  this amount consisted of a  loss recognized on its equity investment in clean diesel technologies  inc cdt  and a  loss on its investment in fuel tech cs gmbh 
fuel tech had a common stock ownership interest in cdt as of december   while fuel tech had a ownership interest in fuel tech cs gmbh as noted above 
please refer to note of the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of related party transactions 
interest expense decreased to  for the twelve month period ended december  from  for the same period in the favorable variance was due solely to the decrease in the average outstanding principal debt balance during the year  and to a decrease in short term interest rates 
other income and expense for the twelve month period ended december  was  versus  for the same period in the decrease was due to a lower level of interest income that was driven by the decrease in short term interest rates noted above  and to the write down of impaired assets 
partially offsetting these factors was a gain in the amount of approximately  related to the dissolution of the wholly owned subsidiaries in poland and taiwan 
the entity in poland has not been operational since  and the entity in taiwan operated only as a sales agency office 
fuel tech recorded a tax benefit of  in related to the italian subsidiary 
there were no domestic income taxes recorded in as fuel tech recorded a net loss for the year 
fuel tech had million in united states federal income tax loss carryforwards as of december   the deferred tax benefit of which has been offset by a valuation allowance in fuel tech s balance sheet 
liquidity and capital resources fuel tech s cash and cash equivalents were approximately million at december  versus million at december  operating activities provided million of cash in primarily due to fuel tech s operating profits 
investing activities  which used cash of million during the year  were primarily comprised of the continued investment in equipment and intellectual property of million  which was partially offset by the aforementioned loan repayment by cdt 
financing activities  which used cash of  during the year  were comprised primarily of debt repayments of  which were offset by cash received from the exercise of stock options 
historically  fuel tech had financed its operations principally through the private placement of its common shares and the private placement of nil coupon non redeemable convertible unsecured loan notes the loan notes 
the loan notes are convertible at any time into fuel tech s common stock 
they bear no interest  have no maturity date and are repayable generally only in the event of the winding up of fuel tech 
fuel tech has therefore classified the loan notes within shareholders equity in its balance sheet 
at december   fuel tech had cash and cash equivalents of  and working capital of  versus  and  at the end of  respectively 
fuel tech  inc fti  a wholly owned subsidiary of fuel tech  has a million revolving credit facility expiring july   which is collateralized by all personal property owned by fti 
fti can use this facility for cash advances and standby letters of credit 
cash advances under this facility bear interest at the bank s prime rate  or at an optional rate that can be selected by fti which is based on the bank s interbank offering rate plus also  fti has a term loan agreement with the same bank for a total principal balance of million 
the principal balance was to be repaid in quarterly installments of  commencing on december   with a final principal payment of  due on january  further  fti entered into an interest rate swap transaction that fixed the rate of interest at on approximately of the outstanding principal balance during the term of the loan 
this swap expired on october  the remaining principal balance bears interest at the bank s prime rate  or an optional rate that can be selected by fti  and is based on the bank s interbank offering rate plus 
the borrowings under this facility are collateralized by all personal property owned by fti 
the million revolving credit facility was obtained via an amendment  effective december   that increased the credit facility from million to million and extended the agreement until july  the term loan was paid in full on january  using funds from the line of credit 
at december   the bank had provided standby letters of credit  predominantly to customers  totaling approximately  in connection with contracts in process 
fti is committed to reimbursing the issuing bank for any payments made by the bank under these letters of credit 
at december   there were no cash borrowings against the revolving credit facility and  was available for utilization 
the carrying amount of debt approximates fair value at december  interest payments were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively fuel tech believes that it will have sufficient resources to fund its growth and operations going forward 
contractual obligations and commitments in its normal course of business  fuel tech enters into agreements that obligate fuel tech to make future payments 
the operating lease obligations noted below are primarily related to supporting the normal operations of the business and are not recognized as liabilities in fuel tech s consolidated balance sheet in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
also shown below is the term loan balance at december   which  as noted previously  was paid in full on january  using funds from the line of credit 
payments due by period in thousands of us dollars contractual cash total less than years years thereafter obligations year operating leases  term loan   total contractual cash   obligations fuel tech in the normal course of business  uses bank performance guarantees and letters of credit in support of construction contracts with customers as follows in support of the warrantee period defined in the contract  or in support of the system performance criteria that are defined in the contract in addition  fuel tech uses letters of credit as security for other obligations as needed in the normal course of business 
as of december   fuel tech has outstanding bank performance guarantees and letters of credit as noted in the table below commitment expiration by period in thousands of us dollars commercial commitments total less than years years thereafter year standby letters of credit and bank guarantees critical accounting policies and estimates the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require fuel tech to make estimates and assumptions 
fuel tech believes that of its significant accounting policies see note to the consolidated financial statements  the following involves a higher degree of judgment and complexity fuel tech uses the percentage of completion method of accounting for certain long term equipment construction and license contracts 
under the percentage of completion method  sales and gross profit are recognized as work is performed based on the relationship between actual engineering hours and equipment construction costs incurred and total estimated hours and costs at completion 
since the financial reporting of these contracts depends on estimates  which are assessed continually during the term of the contract  recognized sales and profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
revisions in profit estimates are reflected in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
forward looking information from time to time  information provided by fuel tech  statements made by its employees or information included in its filings with the securities and exchange commission including this annual report may contain statements that are not historical facts  so called forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of fuel tech s actual future results may differ significantly from those stated in any forward looking statements 
forward looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  product demand  pricing  market acceptance  litigation  risk of dependence on significant customers  third party suppliers and intellectual property rights  risks in product and technology development and other risk factors detailed in this annual report and in fuel tech s securities and exchange commission filings 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk fuel tech s earnings and cash flow are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
fuel tech does not enter into foreign currency forward contracts or into foreign currency option contracts to manage this risk due to the immaterial nature of the transactions involved 
fuel tech is also exposed to changes in interest rates primarily due to its long term debt arrangement refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not have a materially adverse effect on interest expense during the upcoming year ended december
