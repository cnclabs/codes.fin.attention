home videogame gross profit increased  from  of related revenues for the comparable twelve months ended december  to  of related revenues for fiscal the increase in gross profit in fiscal as compared with the prior year s comparable period was due to the release of more new products in than in the revenues for fiscal were primarily comprised of videogames for the new platforms 
home videogame gross profit as a percentage of related revenues decreased from the prior comparable period primarily due to increased amortization of product development costs capitalized per unit sold 
additionally  the decrease was caused by increased price protection reserves for certain products during fiscal research and development expense decreased  from  for the comparable twelve months ended december  to  for fiscal the decrease is primarily due to the increased amount of product development costs capitalized on new generation games and our exit from the coin operated videogame business 
product development costs of  and  were capitalized for fiscal and the comparable twelve months ended december   respectively 
the increase in capitalized software development costs is due to more software development expenses being incurred after the point of technological feasibility 
all related development costs subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility are capitalized 
the development activity and expenditures for home videogames are much greater for new generation platforms than previous platforms 
this increased development activity represents investment for future revenue to be generated from videogames for the new generation platforms 
see note to the financial statements included in this report for a more complete description of the reasons for the ongoing increase in our capitalized development costs 
we anticipate that capitalized development costs will continue to increase as we grow the number of products in development 
selling and marketing expense increased  from  of related revenues for the comparable twelve months ended december  to  of related revenues for fiscal the increase in selling and marketing expense was primarily due to a higher level of advertising necessary to support the increased number of new home videogame products released for fiscal administrative expense decreased  from  for the comparable twelve months ended december  to  for fiscal the comparable twelve months ended december  included  of goodwill amortization of which none was recorded for fiscal pursuant to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no

the only expenses incurred by the coin operated videogame business related to the sale of assets and exploring licensing opportunities for intellectual properties 
expenses related to the coin operated videogame business were not significant to any of the reported line items for the six months ended december  home videogame revenues decreased  from  for the six months ended december  to  for the transition period 
the decrease is primarily due to our strategy for the platform transition from and bit home videogame consoles to the new generation consoles including sony s playstation  nintendo s gamecube and microsoft s xbox 
the transition period primarily consisted of a smaller number of new generation console game sales as compared to the six months ended december  that consisted primarily of a larger number of and bit console game sales 
the adverse impact of the platform transition on our profitability was caused by our shifting product development resources from older platforms to the development of products for the new generation platforms

the development activity and expense for home videogames has increased 
this increased development activity represents investments for future revenue to be generated from videogames for the new generation platforms 
selling and marketing expense decreased  from  for the six months ended december  to  for the transition period 
the decrease in selling and marketing was related to a smaller number of new videogame titles released in the transition period

fiscal compared with fiscal revenues decreased  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal coin operated videogame revenues decreased from  to  home videogame revenues decreased  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the decrease is primarily due to our strategy for the platform transition from and bit home videogames consoles to the new generation consoles including sony s playstation  nintendo s gamecube and microsoft s xbox 
the adverse impact of the platform transition on our profitability was caused by our transition strategy to shift product development resources from older platforms to the development of products for the new generation platforms

coin operated videogame gross profit was  of related revenues in fiscal compared with  of related revenues in fiscal midway exited the coin operated videogame business in the quarter ended june  home videogame gross profit decreased  from  of related revenues in fiscal to  of related revenues in fiscal when approximately of revenues were from the older generation platforms on games that were either previously released or substantially in development at the time midway changed its strategy to only develop for the new generation platforms 
many of these sales were made at lower than historical selling prices due to the effects of the platform transition 
research and development expenses decreased by  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the decrease was in part due to the elimination of certain coin operated functions that were not transferable to the home videogame business  and lower expense relating to the component of product development expense that is based on revenues 
the development activity and expense for home videogames has increased 
this increased development activity represents investments for future revenue to be generated from videogames for the new generation platforms 
selling and marketing expense decreased  from  of revenues in fiscal to  of revenues in fiscal primarily due to the decrease in total net revenues during the same period 
additionally  fiscal was adversely impacted by  for the write down of the unamortized pc distribution agreement acquired in administrative expense increased  or  when excluding the additional  bad debt expense provided for as a result of the exit from the coin operated videogame business

the restructuring expense for fiscal includes  for severance for people   for the disposal of fixed assets   for lease and other commitments and  for administrative clean up activities and other expense 
in fiscal  restructuring expense of  was incurred and represents cost of employee severance relating to reducing certain functions through combining similar activities formerly conducted at different locations 
operating loss in fiscal was  compared with an operating loss of  in fiscal operating loss for fiscal is due to the low level of home videogame revenues with a reduced gross profit as a result of the platform transition and continuing product development expenses from developing games for the new generation of platforms 
fiscal also includes restructuring charges  additional bad debt and inventory write downs totaling  relating to midway s exiting from the coin operated business 
the fiscal operating loss was also due to weaker than anticipated revenues in the second half of the year  which required unusual charges of  the income tax credit was established at an effective rate of for fiscal midway was required under applicable accounting interpretations to provide a valuation allowance for realization of deferred tax assets resulting from tax loss carryforwards 
the valuation allowance decreases the deferred tax assets for tax loss carryforwards to the amount reasonably expected to be utilized within the carryforward period

the fiscal loss includes after tax charges of  or per share for unusual items that related primarily to the abrupt softening of the home videogame business in fiscal financial condition and liquidity the home video business is highly seasonal  and significant working capital is required to finance high levels of inventories and accounts receivable during the quarters ended september and december in addition  one manufacturer of home videogames for midway requires letters of credit for the full purchase price at the time a purchase order is accepted 
in march  midway amended its credit facility to modify credit availability and maturity 
the amended and restated credit agreement now provides for a letter of credit facility and a revolving line of credit with availability through february  the letter of credit facility provides for the availability of  which is fully collateralized with cash or cash equivalents on deposit 
the revolving line of credit provides for the availability of up to  subject to a borrowing base equal to of eligible accounts receivable  less  which is available during the period september  to february  when seasonal working capital requirements are the highest 
the agreement requires  among other things  that midway maintain a minimum level of stockholders equity and net worth 
additionally  the agreement prohibits cash dividends on common stock and restricts the repurchase of our capital stock 
substantially all of our assets are pledged as collateral under our credit agreement 
no borrowings were outstanding under the revolving line of credit at december  and letters of credit outstanding were  and  at december  and  respectively 
management believes that our cash  cash flow from operations and credit facility will be adequate to fund our anticipated levels of inventories  accounts receivable and commitments as described in note to the financial statements included in this report and other working capital requirements for the operation of our business and our other presently anticipated needs for the twelve months ending december  cash used in operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities was  for fiscal compared to cash used of  for the comparable twelve months ended december  although a loss of  was incurred in fiscal  cash of   and  was provided due to the add back of depreciation and amortization  an increase in the allowance for accounts receivable  and an increase in deferred income taxes see note to the financial statements included in this report  respectively 
the cash used in the comparable twelve months ended december  was primarily due to the net loss in that period  offset by  of depreciation and amortization and  for the increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the changes in the operating assets and liabilities resulted in a cash outflow of  for fiscal compared to cash provided of  for the comparable twelve months ended december  the cash outflow from changes in operating assets and liabilities for fiscal was primarily due to an increase in receivables related to the increase in sales in the holiday selling and an increase in capitalized software development costs 
the cash inflow for the comparable twelve months ended december  was primarily due to the reduction in inventories and income tax receivable 
cash provided by investing activities for fiscal included a  net decrease in short term investments partially offset by capital expenditures of  cash used for investing activities for the comparable twelve months ended december  of  included a  net increase in short term investments and  for the purchase of property and equipment 
cash used in financing activities for fiscal was  and consisted primarily of the repurchase of common stock now held as treasury shares for  and the payment of preferred stock dividends of  cash provided by financing activities of  during the comparable twelve months ended december  consisted primarily of  of aggregate cash proceeds received from midway s public offering of  shares of common stock at a price of per share   in net proceeds from the sale of series b convertible preferred stock and warrants  and  from the exercise of stock options 
midway leases various office facilities  a warehouse and equipment under non cancelable operating leases 
additionally  midway enters into license agreements for the use of intellectual property in specific videogames or for a period of time 
some of these agreements provide for advance payments or guarantee minimum payments of royalties 
at december   obligations under these arrangements totaled  net of  of sublease income 
these obligations are not recognized as liabilities in the company s consolidated balance sheet in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
we had no capital lease obligations at december  a summary of midway s contractual obligations at december  is as follows in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years operating leases     advance or guarantee minimum royalty payments   less sublease income    impact of inflation in recent years  the level of inflation affecting midway has been relatively low 
our ability to pass on future cost increases in the form of higher sales prices will continue to be dependent on the prevailing competitive environment and the acceptance of our products in the marketplace 
seasonality the home videogame business is highly seasonal and historically has resulted in higher revenues and operating profit in the quarters ended september and december due to customer purchases preceding the year end retail holiday selling season 
significant working capital is required to finance high levels of inventories and accounts receivable during the quarters ended september and december critical accounting policies and estimates price protection  returns and discounts we record an allowance for price protection  returns and discounts at each balance sheet date 
we base these allowances on expected trends and estimates 
several factors are used in developing these estimates  including a prior experience with price protection  returns and discounts  b expected sell through rates for particular games  c expected rates of requests for such credits  d specific identification of problem accounts  and e existing field inventories 
changes in these factors could result in variances in the amount of allowance required 
for example  if customers request price protection in amounts exceeding the rate expected and if management agrees to grant it  then midway may incur additional charges 
capitalized software development software development costs incurred prior to the establishment of technological feasibility are expensed by midway when incurred and are included in research and development expense 
once a software product has reached technological feasibility  then all subsequent software development costs for that product are capitalized until that product is released for sale 
technological feasibility is evaluated on a product by product basis and can occur early in the development cycle or later depending on required technology to complete the product and the availability of such technology to midway 
after a product is released  the capitalized product development costs are amortized to expense based on the ratio of current sales to the total of current plus projected future sales for each game 
this expense is recorded as a component of cost of sales 
midway evaluates the recoverability of capitalized software development costs on a product by product basis 
a charge is recorded when management s forecast for a particular game indicates that unamortized capitalized costs exceed the net realizable value of that asset 
the net realizable value is the estimated future revenues from that game reduced by the estimated future cost of completing and selling the game 
as a result  the forecasted sales for a given game are a sensitive factor in this calculation 
if revised forecast game sales are less than management s forecast it is possible the company could record charges to write down software development costs previously capitalized 
valuation of long lived assets  including goodwill long lived assets  primarily property and equipment  are reviewed for impairment as events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that the amount of the asset reflected in the company s balance sheet may not be recoverable 
an estimate of undiscounted cash flows produced by the asset  or the appropriate group of assets  is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists 
the estimates of future cash flows involve considerable management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance 
the actual cash flows could differ from management s estimates due to changes in business conditions  operating performance  and economic conditions 
beginning on july   midway adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
as a result of adopting this standard midway no longer amortizes goodwill  but continues to evaluate whether any event has occurred which might indicate that the carrying value of goodwill is not recoverable 
in addition  this standard requires that goodwill be subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
we record inventory write downs when markets rates are lower than cost 
market rates are evaluated based on recent sales transactions  open purchase orders  customer bids  and management s estimates 
cost is determined by the first in  first out method 
valuation of deferred tax assets midway is required under applicable accounting interpretations to provide a valuation allowance for the realization of deferred tax assets  resulting primarily from tax loss carryforwards 
the applicable accounting interpretations limit the amount expected to be utilized within the carryforward period to sources of future taxable income that are more likely than not to be generated within the carryforward period 
when a valuation allowance is deemed necessary  midway records an adjustment to the deferred tax asset  with a corresponding charge to the statement of operations 
in the event that midway determines that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made
