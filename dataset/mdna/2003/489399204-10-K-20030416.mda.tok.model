index to financial statements liquidity and capital resources our liquidity and capital resources requirements include expenditures for joint venture fund investments  real estate held for sale  discounted loan portfolios and working capital needs 
historically  we have not required significant capital resources to support our brokerage and property management operations 
we finance our operations with internally generated funds and borrowings under our revolving lines of credit 
our investments in real estate are typically financed by mortgage loans secured primarily by that real estate 
these mortgage loans are generally nonrecourse in that  in the event of default  recourse will be limited to the mortgaged property serving as collateral 
in some cases  the company guarantees a portion of the loan related to a joint venture investment  usually until some condition  such as completion of construction or leasing or certain net operating income criteria  has been met 
the company does not expect these guarantees to materially affect liquidity or capital resources 
during  we entered into three credit agreements 
the first agreement is an unsecured revolving credit facility for million with us bank and east west bank for use in acquisitions and working capital purposes 
this facility replaces the loans from east west bank and united california bank in the total amount of million 
we also entered into a loan agreement with pacific western national bank in the amount of million

table of contents 
index to financial statements to the extent that we engage in additional strategic investments  including real estate  note portfolio  or acquisitions of other property management companies  we may need to obtain third party financing which could include bank financing or the public sale or private placement of debt or equity securities 
we believe that existing cash  plus capital generated from property management and leasing  brokerage  sales of real estate owned  collections from notes receivable  as well as our current lines of credit  will provide us with sufficient capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
under our current joint venture strategy  we generally contribute property  expertise  and typically a fully funded initial cash contribution without commitment to additional funding by the company 
capital required for additional improvements and supporting operations during lease up and stabilization periods is generally obtained at the time of acquisition via debt financing or third party investors 
accordingly  the company generally does not have significant capital commitments with unconsolidated entities 
infrequently  there may be some circumstances when the company  usually with the other members of the joint venture entity  may be required to contribute additional capital for a limited period of time 
the company believes that it has the capital resources  generated from our business activities and our borrowing capacity  to finance any such capital requirements  and does not believe that any additional capital contributions to joint ventures will materially affect liquidity 
our need  if any  to raise additional funds to meet our capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the success and pace of the implementation of our strategy for growth 
we regularly monitor capital raising alternatives to be able to take advantage of other available avenues to support our working capital and investment needs  including strategic partnerships and other alliances  bank borrowings  and the sale of equity or debt securities 
the company expects to meet the repayment obligations of notes payable and borrowings under lines of credit from cash generated by our business activities  including the sale of assets and the refinancing of debt 
we intend to retain earnings to finance our growth and  therefore  do not anticipate paying dividends 
contractual obligations and commitments at december   the company s contractual cash obligations  including debt  lines of credit  capital lease obligations and operating leases include the following payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years debt notes payable borrowings under lines of credit senior unsecured notes subordinated debt total debt capital lease obligations operating leases total contractual cash obligations critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company s real estate services revenues are generally recorded when the related services are performed or at closing in the case of real estate sales 
property management fees are recognized over time as earned based upon the terms of the management agreement 
leasing commission revenues are accounted for in accordance with the provisions of sab accordingly  leasing commissions that are payable upon tenant occupancy  payment of rent or other events beyond the company s control are now recognized upon the occurrence of such events 
in accordance with eitf  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  the company records brokerage commission revenues and expenses on a gross basis 
of the criteria listed in the eitf  the company is the primary obligor in the transaction  does not have inventory risk  performs all  or part  of the service  has credit risk  and has wide latitude in establishing the price of services rendered and discretion in selection of agents and determination of service specifications 
due to these factors  gross reporting is appropriate 
residential real estate sales revenue and gains on sale of commercial property are recognized at the close of escrow when title to the real property passes to the buyer 
the company follows the requirements for profit recognition as set forth by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for sales of real estate 
the company presents sales of commercial real estate on a net gain on sale basis due to the fact that these properties are typically held for two to three years and generate rental income and operating expenses during the holding period 
residential real estate is accounted for as inventory because these properties are generally held for less than one year and do not generate income during the holding period 
accordingly  gross revenue and cost of sales are presented separately on the statements of income 
revenues on notes receivable are recognized as follows the company accounts for performing discounted loan portfolios that it began acquiring in on an effective interest basis under the provisions of practice bulletin through  the company acquired pools of claims  judgements  and other defaulted credit transactions 
revenues on these assets are accounted for as follows cash payments on defaulted notes are applied to the cost basis until fully recovered before any revenue is recognized 
when claims and judgements purchased are subsequently structured into performing collateralized notes  the difference between the cost basis of the asset and the fair value of the resulting note is accreted into interest and other income over the life of the note 
valuation of investments the company reviews each of its investments in joint ventures on a periodic basis for evidence of impairment 
impairment losses are recognized whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate declines in value of an investment below carrying value and the related undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the asset s carrying amount 
in  the company recorded impairment losses of approximately million on remaining technology investments and approximately million on a real estate investment based on this evaluation 
valuation of intangibles the company s intangible assets substantially consist of property management contracts which are amortized on a straight line basis over seven years  and goodwill representing costs paid in excess of net assets of acquired businesses 
through december   the company used an undiscounted cash flow methodology to determine whether underlying operating cash flows were sufficient to recover the carrying amount of goodwill 
beginning january   goodwill is no longer amortized  but is evaluated annually for impairment based on a reporting unit fair value approach as required by sfas in determining fair value of a reporting unit  the company relies on the application of generally accepted valuation approaches 
during the year ended december   no impairment was indicated by application of the valuation analysis 
impact of inflation and changing prices inflation has not had a significant impact on the results of operations of the company in recent years and is not anticipated to have a significant impact in the foreseeable future 
the company s exposure to market risk from changing prices consists primarily of fluctuations in rental rates of commercial and residential properties  market interest rates on residential mortgages and debt obligations and real estate property values 
the revenues associated with the commercial services businesses are impacted by fluctuations in interest rates  lease rates  real property values and the availability of space and competition in the market place 
commercial service revenues are derived from a broad range of services that are primarily transaction driven and are therefore volatile in nature and highly competitive 
the revenues of the property management operations with respect to rental properties are highly dependent upon the aggregate rents of the properties managed  which are affected by rental rates and building occupancy rates 
rental rate increases are dependent upon market conditions and the competitive environments in the respective locations of the properties 
employee compensation is the principal cost element of property management 
economic trends in were characterized by general slowdowns in commercial leasing volume in the us recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations sfas 
sfas prospectively prohibits the pooling of interest method of accounting for business combinations initiated after june  the company s adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
also in july  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas  which is effective january   includes requirements to test goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment rather than amortize them 
in testing for impairment in accordance with sfas  goodwill was assigned to the reporting units based upon the amount of goodwill generated at the time of acquisition of the businesses by the reporting unit 
an earnings multiple appropriate to the respective reporting unit was applied to the cash basis net operating income of the reporting unit 
this process enables a fair approximation of the entity s value  which is then compared to the net book value of the reporting unit 
as a result of the evaluation performed of its goodwill as described above  the company has determined that there was no goodwill impairment as of the transition date or december  the effects on earnings and earnings per share of excluding such goodwill amortization from and are as follows for the year ended december  net income  as reported goodwill amortization  net of tax effect net income  excluding goodwill amortization basic earnings per share earnings per share as reported earnings per share  excluding goodwill amortization diluted earnings per share earnings per share as reported earnings per share  excluding goodwill amortization in october  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no
