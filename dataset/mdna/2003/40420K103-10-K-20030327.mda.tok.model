item  management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations 
domestic exploration and production operations during the three years ended december   harken has drilled or participated in the drilling of oil and gas wells domestically  completing of the wells drilled 
harken s domestic drilling activity increased following the august acquisition of xplor energy  inc xplor  a wholly owned subsidiary and the december acquisition of prospects from benz energy  whereby harken acquired a variety of domestic prospect acreage within its texas and louisiana gulf coast area of emphasis 
drilling activity was also spurred by increased oil and gas prices  which resulted in significant domestic operating cash flows from harken s producing property base 
harken also capitalized on the higher product prices by selling certain non strategic producing properties  most of which were outside of harken s gulf coast operating focus 
such producing property and mineral interest sales during the three years ended december   generated cash proceeds of approximately million  which was used in part to support harken s exploration and development activities 
during  harken s domestic operations shifted from primarily an exploration and development focus to an acquisition growth strategy  with a reduced emphasis on exploration 
this shift allows harken to conserve its capital resources to repurchase convertible debt obligations pursuant to a proposed capital restructuring 
for further information concerning this proposed capital restructuring  see liquidity and capital resources contained in part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations 
in april  a wholly owned subsidiary of harken acquired certain property interests the republic properties from republic resources  inc  in exchange for  shares of harken common stock 
the republic properties consist of interests in oil and gas wells in nine fields and interests in additional prospect acreage located in southern louisiana and the texas gulf coast region 
harken is seeking additional acquisition opportunities to expand its domestic operations 
although capital expenditure plans for are decreased compared to historical levels  harken is continuing to seek joint venture and farmout opportunities to explore and develop its domestic prospect portfolio and pursue domestic oil and gas reserve growth through acquisitions 
however  harken s ability to make future acquisition transactions may be affected by many reasons  including the market value of harken common stock and the successful completion of its proposed capital restructuring 
see cautionary statements contained in part i item  business 
as of december   harken operates or owns a non operating working interest in oil wells and gas wells in the united states 
harken s domestic operations are located in the onshore and offshore gulf coast regions of south texas and louisiana  portions of west texas and the texas panhandle region 
there were no domestic customers during  or which individually represented or more of harken s consolidated revenues 
gulf coast operations on august   harken acquired xplor whereby xplor became a wholly owned subsidiary of harken 
at december   through xplor and other wholly owned subsidiaries  harken owns operating and non operating working interests in one oil well and gas wells located in various counties in south texas  concentrated in the raymondville area of willacy county and the esperanza field in wharton county 
in louisiana  through xplor  harken owns operated and non operated interests in oil wells and gas wells concentrated primarily in the main pass area offshore plaquemines parish  the lake raccourci area of lafourche parish and the abbeville and leleux fields in vermillion parish 
on april   harken acquired the republic properties  which consist of oil and gas wells located primarily in jackson county  texas  the bayou sorrel field located in iberville and lafayette  lafayette parishes  louisiana 
at december   approximately of harken s domestic proved reserves are located in the gulf coast region of louisiana and texas 
during and  harken has drilled or participated in the drilling of several gulf coast area exploratory and development wells 
wells drilled in include the state lease and the state lease  both in the lake raccourci area 
the state lease  which was completed in september  had initial gross production of million cubic feet equivalent per day and is currently producing million gross cubic feet equivalent per day 
the state lease well was completed in october and recorded initial production in excess of million cubic feet equivalent per day and is currently producing million gross cubic feet equivalent per day 
harken holds a and working interest  respectively  in these two wells 
during and  harken drilled wells in the raymondville area of south texas  successfully completing of the wells drilled 
harken holds an approximate working interest in the raymondville area wells 
west texas operations harken operates or owns non operated interests in oil wells and gas wells in hutchinson and gray counties and oil wells in hockley county  all located in the panhandle area of texas 
during  harken performed recompletion procedures on selected panhandle producing wells in order to begin production from certain behind pipe zones 
harken believes such procedures may be applied to additional producing well bores within its panhandle areas 
at december   approximately of harken s domestic proved reserve volumes are located in west texas 
prospect acreage in addition to the producing property interests discussed above  harken  through certain wholly owned subsidiaries  owns interests in a variety of domestic prospect acreage 
through xplor  harken owns acreage interests in the lake raccourci and lapeyrouse fields of lafourche and terrebonne parishes  respectively  in louisiana 
as part of the december prospect purchase from benz energy  inc  harken gulf exploration owns prospect acreage interests in the old ocean field in matagorda and brazoria counties of texas  the rayburn field in liberty county  texas and certain salt dome prospects in various counties in mississippi 
harken successfully drilled exploratory wells in the lake raccourci  lapeyrouse and old ocean fields during and middle american exploration and development operations colombia at december   global held  through harken de colombia  ltd  a wholly owned subsidiary of global  four exclusive association contracts with empresa colombiana de petroleos ecopetrol  the state owned colombian oil company 
global has proved reserves attributable to three of its four association contracts  the alcaravan  bolivar and bocachico contracts 
in the alcaravan contract  global has proved reserves in the palo blanco and anteojos fields 
in the bolivar contract  global has proved reserves in the buturama field 
in the bocachico contract  global has proved reserves in the rio negro field 
ecopetrol  which purchases all of global s crude oil production  individually accounted for and of harken s consolidated revenues in and  respectively 
global has responded to recent increased security concerns in colombia by implementing a number of operating changes including the decision to replace its field operating employees with outsourced personnel 
global s operating plans in colombia are continuing  subject to the ongoing monitoring of security developments 
for further discussion of global s security concerns in colombia  see cautionary statements contained in part i  item alcaravan contract the alcaravan association contract the alcaravan contract gives global the exclusive right to explore for  develop and produce oil and gas throughout approximately  acres in the alcaravan area of colombia  which is located in colombia s llanos basin approximately miles east of santafe de bogota 
global has completed the maximum six year seismic and exploratory drilling program of the alcaravan contract the exploration period 
in october  global received notification from ecopetrol that global could proceed with the sole risk development of the palo blanco field of the alcaravan association contract 
as such  the term of the alcaravan contract related to the productive areas has been extended for a period of years from the date of such election by ecopetrol  subject to the entire term of the alcaravan contract being limited to no more than years 
due to ecopetrol s election not to participate  global elected to proceed with the development of the palo blanco field on a sole risk basis  whereby global is entitled to receive ecopetrol s share of production after deduction for ecopetrol s royalty interest  until global has recovered of its successful well costs expended  after which time ecopetrol could elect to begin to receive its working interest share of production 
accordingly  global reflects its interest in gross production and cash flows in its financial statements and reserve information 
global has retained the acreage covering those structure areas associated with the palo blanco and anteojos discoveries 
alcaravan contract operations global has drilled five wells on the alcaravan acreage  two of which are currently producing  the estero and estero wells 
in february  global drilled the estero well and in january  global drilled the estero well  both located on the palo blanco field 
daily combined production from the estero and estero wells from the palo blanco field have averaged a total of approximately gross barrels per day during the first quarter of during the fourth quarter of  global successfully conducted a workover of the estero to reduce water production from that well 
global s workover operations resulted in reduced water cuts for the estero well 
no additional workover operations are anticipated for estero or estero during at december   global reflects proved reserves of approximately million net barrels related to its interest in the palo blanco field 
during  global produced a total of approximately  gross barrels of oil from its palo blanco field  and since inception and through december   global has produced a cumulative total of approximately  gross barrels of oil from its palo blanco field 
the next development well to be drilled in the palo blanco field is scheduled for early for an estimated cost of completion of less than million 
such costs are expected to be funded out of a cash on hand and cash from operations 
if sufficient funds are not available  global intends to seek additional financing and there can be no assurance that global will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms 
these planned international capital expenditures are discretionary and  as a result  will be curtailed if sufficient funds are not available 
such expenditure curtailments  however  could result in harken losing certain prospect acreage or reducing its interest in future development projects 
in april  global commenced pipeline transportation of production from the alcaravan contract area through its constructed flowline connecting the palo blanco field to an existing crude oil pipeline system adjacent to the field 
during early portions of the estero production tests  sustained production during and the first quarter of was limited to approximately  gross barrels of oil per day due to pipeline constraints and pumping capacity 
beginning in april  such pipeline constraints were partially alleviated 
in addition  during the second quarter of  global purchased the kilometer guarimena to santiago crude oil pipeline and negotiated a new transportation agreement with the owner operator of the pipeline that transports crude oil from santiago north to market points 
as a result of the above steps  though global s palo blanco production levels are currently less than transport capacity  global is now allowed to transport up to  gross barrels of oil per day combined from estero  estero and the canacabare wells 
this  gross barrel limitation will also apply to the cajaro  which is described below 
harken believes that the transport capacity is sufficient for production from all four wells 
at december   global also reflects proved reserves of approximately  net barrels related to its interest in the anteojos prospect within the alcaravan contract area 
the canacabare well  which was drilled during to a total depth of  feet  had not produced consistently due to the rainy season and resulting operating conditions in the llanos basin area in colombia 
during the last half of  and first quarter of  global installed a flowline connection  at a cost of approximately  to global s existing palo blanco pipeline facility and expects that it will begin daily production from the canacabare well beginning in late march or early april global s net revenue interest in any production that may be discovered on the anteojos prospect will depend on whether or not ecopetrol elects to participate 
upon the election by ecopetrol to participate in a field and upon commencement of production from the field  global will begin to be reimbursed by ecopetrol out of ecopetrol s share of production  net of royalties  for of all direct exploratory well costs incurred prior to the point of ecopetrol s participation 
reimbursement by ecopetrol to global may be either in cash or through allowing its share of production to apply to global s cost recovery 
production from a field in which ecopetrol elects to participate will be allocated as follows ecopetrol  on behalf of the colombian government  will receive a royalty interest of of all production  and all production after royalty payments will be allocated to ecopetrol and to global 
ecopetrol and global will be responsible for all future development costs and operating expenses in direct proportion to their interest in production 
if ecopetrol does not elect to participate  global has the choice to proceed with the development of the prospect area on a sole risk basis 
if global does proceed on a sole risk basis  it will be entitled to receive ecopetrol s share of production after deduction for ecopetrol s royalty interest  until global has recovered of its successful well costs expended  after which time ecopetrol could elect to receive its working interest share of production 
bocachico contract under the bocachico association contract the bocachico contract  global acquired the exclusive rights to conduct exploration and production activities and drilling on this area  which covers approximately  acres in the middle magdalena valley of central colombia 
global has fulfilled all of the work requirements for the first four years of the bocachico contract and agreed with ecopetrol to amend the bocachico contract whereby the remaining work requirements for the fifth and sixth year were transferred to global s cajaro association contract  which is discussed below 
with the execution of this amendment  global has completed the exploration period related to the bocachico contract 
the production sharing and term arrangements under the bocachico contract are substantially similar to those under the alcaravan contract 
the bocachico contract provides that two years following the end of the exploration period and for any field in which ecopetrol elects to participate  the bocachico contract area will be further reduced to of the original area 
two years thereafter  the bocachico contract area will be reduced to the area of the field that is in production or development  plus a reserve zone of five kilometers in width around the productive boundary of such field 
the producing field plus the zone surrounding such field will become the area of exploitation 
global has and will continue to designate any acreage to be released subject to acceptance by ecopetrol 
bocachico contract operations from to  global drilled and completed three wells on the bocachico contract area  all in the rio negro prospect 
global initiated sales of production from both the torcaz and torcaz wells to a local purchaser at the wellsites and for most of these wells produced in excess of gross barrels of oil per day 
from and until the last six months of  global could not sustain production consistently from the torcaz wells 
however  during the last six months of  global performed workover procedures on the torcaz well and averaged approximately gross barrels of production per day from the torcaz field 
at december   global reflected proved reserves of approximately  net barrels related to its interest in the rio negro field 
there are no capital expenditures scheduled for the rio negro field in or in december  global submitted an application to ecopetrol for their participation in the rio negro field 
global submitted an updated application to ecopetrol in october  which it plans to review with ecopetrol in april global s net revenue interest in production from the bocachico contract will depend upon whether or not ecopetrol elects to participate 
if ecopetrol does not elect to participate  global would then have the choice to proceed with the development of the prospect area on a sole risk basis 
if global does proceed on a sole risk basis  it will be entitled to receive ecopetrol s share of production  after deduction for ecopetrol s royalty interest  until global has recovered of its successful well costs expended  after which time ecopetrol could elect to receive its working interest share of production 
should ecopetrol elect to participate in the development of the bocachico contract  global would receive of the gross revenues from production from the bocachico contract area and to the extent that a field produces in excess of million barrels  global s net revenue interest would decrease 
should ecopetrol elect to participate or global elect to proceed on a sole risk basis  the term of the bocachico contract related to the productive areas will be extended for a period of years from the date of such election  subject to the entire term of the bocachico contract being limited to no more than years 
bolivar contract under the bolivar association contract the bolivar contract  global acquired the exclusive rights to conduct exploration and production activities in the bolivar contract area  which covers approximately  acres in the northern middle magdalena valley of central colombia 
in february  global received notification from ecopetrol that it had elected not to participate in the development of the buturama field of the bolivar association contract 
due to ecopetrol s election not to participate  global has elected to proceed with the development of the field on a sole risk basis  whereby global is entitled to receive ecopetrol s share of production  after deduction of ecopetrol s royalty interest  until global has recovered of its successful well costs expended  after which time ecopetrol could elect to begin to receive its working interest share of production 
accordingly  global reflects its interest in gross production and cash flows in its financial statements and reserve information 
in addition  the term of the bolivar contract related to the productive areas has been extended for a period of years from the date of such election by ecopetrol  subject to the entire term of the bolivar contract being limited to no more than years 
global has completed all of the work obligations for the first five years of the bolivar contract 
global and ecopetrol entered into an agreement in june whereby global relinquished all but approximately  of the bolivar contract area acreage in exchange for the release from the sixth year bolivar contract work obligations 
the release of such acreage did not affect global s proved reserves on the bolivar contract area 
with the execution of this amendment  global has completed the exploration period related to the bolivar contract 
the production sharing and term arrangements under the bolivar contract are substantially similar to the alcaravan and bocachico contracts 
bolivar contract operations global has drilled four wells on the bolivar contract area 
in november  global spudded its first well on the bolivar contract acreage  the catalina  which was found to be productive 
in march  global spudded the olivo  which was drilled from the same surface location as the catalina  and was also found to be productive 
two additional wells  the laurel  drilled in  and the olivo  drilled in early  were unproductive 
at december   global reflects proved reserves primarily proved undeveloped of approximately million net barrels related to its interest in the buturama field 
global plans to drill two development wells in the buturama field  scheduled for  for a total cost of completion of approximately million 
such costs are expected to be funded out of cash on hand and cash from operations 
if sufficient funds are not available  global intends to seek additional financing  however  there can be no assurance that global will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms 
during  the catalina and olivo produced a total of  gross barrels of oil and  since inception  global has produced cumulative production of approximately  gross barrels of oil from these wells 
during the last part of and first quarter of  the catalina and olivo wells experienced mechanical problems  with workovers and recompletions completed in at a total approximate cost of  which was funded out of a combination of cash on hand and cash from operations 
during the fourth quarter of  global modified the lift systems on both the catalina and olivo wells at a combined cost of  global s work on the lift systems resulted in increased production volumes for the bolivar contract area all of which is currently derived from the olivo well  since the catalina well is temporarily shut in 
global intends on conducting additional work on the lift system for the catalina well during the second quarter of at an estimated cost of  global expects to continue to transport of current and projected bolivar area production through its current trucking operations 
for further discussion of global s security concerns in colombia  see cautionary statements section below 
cajaro contract in december  global signed an association contract the cajaro contact with ecopetrol  covering the cajaro contract area 
under the cajaro contract  which became effective in february  global acquired the exclusive rights to conduct exploration and production activities in the cajaro contract area  which covers approximately  acres in colombia s llanos basin adjacent to global s alcaravan contract area 
the signing of the cajaro contract was pursuant to global s exercise of contract option rights contained as part of the el retorno technical evaluation agreement  which global had previously signed in may  and following the completion of certain seismic reprocessing procedures 
under the terms of the cajaro contract  if during the three year minimum exploration period  global discovers one or more fields capable of producing oil or gas in quantities that are economically exploitable and ecopetrol elects to participate in the development of the field or global chooses to proceed with the development on a sole risk basis  the term of the cajaro contract will be extended for a period of years from the date of such discovery 
global s net revenue interest in any production that may be discovered on the cajaro contract will depend on whether or not ecopetrol elects to participate 
upon the election by ecopetrol to participate in a field and upon commencement of production from the field  global will begin to be reimbursed by ecopetrol out of ecopetrol s share of production  net of royalties  for of all seismic costs and direct exploratory well costs including costs related to dry holes incurred prior to the point of ecopetrol s participation 
reimbursement by ecopetrol to global may either be in cash  or through allowing its share of production to apply to global s cost recovery 
production from a field in which ecopetrol elects to participate will be allocated as follows ecopetrol  on behalf of the colombian government  will receive a royalty interest ranging from to based on levels of average monthly production of all production  and all production after royalty payments will be allocated to ecopetrol and to global 
ecopetrol and global will be responsible for all future development costs and operating expenses in direct proportion to their interest in production 
similar to global s other association contracts with ecopetrol  for any cajaro contract field in which ecopetrol elects not to participate  global could elect to proceed with the development of the field on a sole risk basis  whereby global would be entitled to receive ecopetrol s share of production  after deduction of ecopetrol s royalty interest  until global has recovered of its successful well costs expended  after which time ecopetrol could elect to begin to receive its working interest share of production 
the acreage relinquishment arrangements under the cajaro contract are substantially similar to those under global s bocachico association contract with ecopetrol 
cajaro contract operations in february  global commenced drilling operations on the initial well required to be drilled in the cajaro association contract  the cajaro well 
as of march   the cajaro well has reached a depth of approximately  feet and recorded oil shows in the ubaque and mirador formations 
global has disassembled the equipment contracted for the drilling operation and expects a completion rig to arrive by march  there can be no assurances  but if successful  production from the cajaro well would be transported through global s existing palo blanco pipeline facilities  subject to the  gross barrel limitation relating to the palo blanco field 
costs to drill the cajaro well are estimated at approximately million and will be incurred in these costs are expected to be funded out of cash on hand and cash from operations 
if sufficient funds are not available  global intends to seek additional financing and there can be no assurance that global will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms 
middle american operations peru in april  global  through a wholly owned subsidiary  signed a technical evaluation agreement peru tea with perupetro  the national oil company of peru 
the peru tea covers an area of approximately million gross acres in northeastern peru 
under the terms of the peru tea  global has the option to convert the peru tea to a seven year exploration contract  with a twenty two year production period 
terms of the peru tea allow global to conduct a study of the area that will include the reprocessing of seismic data and evaluation of previous well data 
global is currently negotiating with perupetro an extension to the peru tea  which is currently scheduled to expire in april middle american operations panama in september  global  through a wholly owned subsidiary  signed a technical evaluation agreement panama tea with the ministry of commerce and industry for the republic of panama 
the panama tea covers an area of approximately million gross acres divided into three blocks in and offshore panama 
under the terms of the panama tea  which extends for a period of months  global is to perform certain work program procedures and studies to be submitted to the panamanian government with an option to negotiate and enter into one or more contracts for the exploration and exploitation of hydrocarbons with the ministry of commerce and industry 
middle american exploration and development operations costa rica under the terms of an exploration and production concession contract with the republic of costa rica the costa rica contract  global  through an investment in harken costa rica holdings hcrh  a nevada limited liability company  owns an interest in approximately million acres in the north and south limon back arc basin onshore and offshore costa rica 
global s participation in costa rica is structured whereby a wholly owned subsidiary owns a share of the stock of hcrh  with an affiliate of mkj xploration  inc mkj owning the remaining stock of hcrh 
mkj is the operator of hcrh and the costa rica contract 
costa rica operations in november  hcrh commenced its offshore seismic acquisition program in costa rica to collect approximately square kilometers of d seismic information 
the seismic data confirmed the viability of the moin prospect in both the tertiary and cretaceous target horizons 
in july  hcrh filed its environmental impact study requesting an environmental permit related to the planned drilling operation with the costa rican environmental agency setena 
in march  setena denied its approval of the requested environmental permit 
hcrh has filed an appeal related to this ruling by setena 
in january  the costa rica constitutional court rendered a published opinion in a suit that had been filed against another oil and gas operator and the costa rican ministry of environment and energy minae by certain environmental groups 
in its opinion  in this case  the constitutional court of costa rica found  among other issues  that setena did not have the current authority to grant environmental permits 
in addition  proposed legislation pending in the costa rica legislature seeks to abolish the costa rica government s rights to grant hydrocarbon exploration contracts 
due to the costa rica constitutional court decision discussed above  even though it did not directly involve hcrh  as well as the pending legislation described above  harken and global believe that hcrh s appeal to setena for reconsideration of its denial of the requested permit  or any similar recourse  will be unsuccessful 
further  recent political developments in costa rica  in the opinion of harken and global  severely limit the opportunity for future oil and gas exploration in costa rica 
see cautionary statements below 
other middle american operations global is committed to broadening its exploration efforts internationally  in addition to its existing operations in colombia  peru and panama 
global s operational experience in those areas may enable global to expand its exploration efforts elsewhere in latin america 
global s business strategy is to focus on improvement of its cash flow by increasing its daily production volumes as well as to identify  develop and promote energy projects from throughout latin america to industry and financial partners and to aggregate assets in latin america through strategic acquisitions and alliances 
cautionary statements certain statements contained in this annual report  including statements of harken management s current expectations  intentions  plans and beliefs  are forward looking statements  as defined in section d of the securities exchange act of and the private securities litigation reform act of 
statements before  after or including the words may  will  could  should  believe  expect  future  potential  anticipate  intend  plan  estimate  or continue or the negative or other variations of these words  and 
other statements about matters that are not historical facts 
such forward looking statements involve known and unknown risk  uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results  performance  timing or achievements of harken to be materially different from any results  performance  timing or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
additional cautionary statements include  among others  the following risks associated with harken s financial condition if harken does not continue to meet the listing requirements of the american stock exchange  its common stock could be delisted 
the american stock exchange requires companies to fulfill certain requirements in order for their shares to continue to be listed 
the securities of a company may be considered for delisting if the company fails to meet certain financial thresholds  including if the company has stockholders equity of less than million and has sustained losses from continuing operations and or net losses in its five most recent fiscal years 
as of december   harken s stockholders equity was million and  as discussed below  harken has sustained losses in each of harken s last five fiscal years 
as of march   harken s stockholders equity has increased to an amount over million 
there can be no assurance that harken s stockholders equity will remain above or that harken will not report additional losses in the future 
if these aspects of harken s financial condition do not improve  harken s common stock may be considered for delisting 
if harken s common stock is delisted from the american stock exchange for any reason and harken is deemed not to have used its best efforts to maintain such listing  harken will be in default under harken s european notes and  as a result of cross default provisions  harken s other debt obligations 
any default under harken s debt agreements will result in substantially all of harken s debt obligations becoming due in full 
harken does not have sufficient funds to pay harken s debt obligations in cash and there is no assurance harken will obtain such funds if such debt became due  which would result in a material adverse effect on harken s financial position and results of operations 
the potential delisting of harken s common stock could adversely affect harken s ability to raise capital in the future by issuing common stock or securities convertible into common stock 
harken has a history of losses and may suffer losses in the future 
harken has reported losses in each of the last five fiscal years  including a net loss of approximately million for the year ended december  harken has reported cumulative net losses of approximately million over the last five fiscal years 
harken s ability to generate net income is strongly affected by  among other factors  harken s ability to successfully drill harken s undeveloped reserves as well as the market price of crude oil and natural gas 
during the fourth quarter of  harken recorded a writedown of harken s oil and gas properties of approximately million primarily due to a significant reduction in harken s proved undeveloped reserves in colombia following the drilling of a non productive well 
if harken is unsuccessful in drilling productive wells or the market price of crude oil and natural gas declines  harken may report additional losses in the future 
consequently  future losses may adversely affect harken s business  prospects  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
if harken cannot obtain stockholder approval for the issuance of shares of common stock to redeem certain of its existing convertible notes and harken is unable to pay cash at maturity  harken could be subject to potential delisting of its common stock from the american stock exchange 
the issuance of a number of shares that is greater than of harken s currently outstanding shares of common stock requires stockholder approval as a condition to listing such additional shares on the american stock exchange 
currently  harken does not have sufficient funds to pay its existing convertible notes in cash upon maturity  or to otherwise redeem or repurchase these notes 
harken has obtained stockholder approval for the issuance of shares of common stock to redeem up to million principal amount of the european notes due may  at harken s annual stockholders meeting held on january  to comply with the rules of the american stock exchange 
as of march   approximately million principal amount of european notes was outstanding 
harken also has the right to redeem for shares of common stock approximately million principal amount of the benz convertible notes that mature in november and million principal amount of the waverley note that matures in september although the exact number of shares which may be issued in connection with redemptions of the benz convertible notes and the waverley note will depend upon the number of shares of common stock outstanding at that time  the amount of notes to be redeemed for common stock and the average market price of harken s common stock at the time of the redemptions 
the redemption for common stock of the notes may result in the issuance of a number of shares that is greater than of harken s currently outstanding shares of common stock 
consequently  the rules of the american stock exchange may require additional stockholder approval as a condition to listing such additional shares on that exchange 
if harken does not obtain required stockholder approvals  its common stock could be subject to potential delisting from the american stock exchange 
see also if harken does not continue to meet the listing requirements of the american stock exchange  its common stock could be delisted 
harken may have an insufficient number of authorized shares of common stock to redeem convertible notes due in  which would cause it to restructure the notes or to pay cash at maturity neither of which harken may be able to accomplish 
harken currently has million shares of common stock authorized for issuance 
as of march   approximately million shares were outstanding and million shares were reserved for issuance 
there is approximately million shares of common stock available for issuance 
see risks associated with market conditions harken may issue additional shares of common stock that may dilute the value of its common stock and adversely affect the market price of harken s common stock 
the redemption of the european notes  the benz convertible notes and the waverley note may result in an issuance of shares that is in excess of the amount of shares currently authorized for issuance 
harken has included a proposal to increase its authorized common stock in the preliminary proxy statement for harken s annual stockholders meeting scheduled to be held on or about may  prior to may   the maturity date of the european notes 
while harken believes that it will be able to hold the stockholders meeting before the maturity of the european notes  there can be no assurances 
absent receiving stockholder approval at a meeting  harken would be required to otherwise restructure the then outstanding notes prior to maturity or pay cash at maturity 
there can be no assurance that  in such an event  harken will be successful in restructuring its obligations under the outstanding notes prior to maturity 
harken currently does not have sufficient funds to pay such notes in cash upon maturity and it is unlikely that it will have such funds prior to maturity 
if harken is unsuccessful in redeeming the then outstanding european notes prior to maturity for common stock  harken would experience a material adverse impact on its financial position and results of operations 
assuming a redemption price of per share for harken s common stock  the table below reflects the number of shares of common stock required to be issued in order to redeem harken s existing convertible notes due in as of march  amount shares of common stock to indebtedness outstanding be issued in redemption maturity date european notes   may  waverley note   september  benz convertible notes   november  harken s financial condition may suffer if estimates of its oil and gas reserve information are adjusted  and fluctuations in oil and gas prices and other factors affect harken s oil and gas reserves 
harken s oil and gas reserve information is based upon criteria mandated by the securities and exchange commission the sec  and reflects only estimates of the accumulation of oil and gas and the economic recoverability of those volumes 
harken s future production  revenues and expenditures with respect to such oil and gas reserves will likely be different from estimates  and any material differences may negatively affect harken s business  financial condition and results of operations 
petroleum engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner 
estimates of economically recoverable oil and gas reserves and of future net cash flows necessarily depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions 
because all reserve estimates are to some degree subjective  each of the following items may prove to differ materially from that assumed in estimating reserves 
the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered  
the production and operating costs incurred  
the amount and timing of future development expenditures  and 
future oil and gas sales prices 
furthermore  different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserves and cash flow based on the same available data 
the estimated discounted future net cash flows described in this annual report for the year ended december   should not be considered as the current market value of the estimated oil and gas reserves attributable to harken s properties from proved reserves 
such estimates are based on prices and costs as of the date of the estimate  in accordance with sec requirements  while future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower 
the sec requires that harken report its oil and natural gas reserves using the price as of the last day of the year 
using lower values in forecasting reserves will result in a shorter life being given to producing oil and natural gas properties because such properties  as their production levels are estimated to decline  will reach an uneconomic limit  with lower prices  at an earlier date 
there can be no assurance that a decrease in oil and gas prices or other differences in harken s estimates of its reserve will not adversely affect harken s financial condition and results of operations 
harken may require future waivers and amendments to its bank credit facility covenant requirements 
harken s bank credit facility with guaranty bank  fsb requires certain of its subsidiaries the borrowers  to maintain certain financial covenant ratios and requirements  as calculated on a quarterly basis 
the guaranty bank facility requires the borrowers  among other things  to maintain a maximum liability to equity ratio as defined in the agreement of not more than to  a current ratio as defined in the agreement of not less than to  and a debt service coverage ratio as defined in the agreement of not less than to in addition  the agreement requires that general and administrative expenses of the borrowers must not exceed of the borrowers net revenue for the quarter ended december  and for each quarter thereafter 
the guaranty bank facility matures on december  if harken or the borrowers are not in compliance with their bank financial covenant ratios or requirements in the future and are unable to obtain a waiver or amendment to the guaranty bank facility requirements  the bank credit facility would be in default and callable by guaranty bank 
in addition  due to cross default provisions in harken s european notes  senior convertible notes due and collectively  the european notes  benz convertible notes and waverley note  substantially all of harken s debt obligations would become due in full if any debt is in default 
expectations of future operating results and continued compliance with financial covenants cannot be assured and harken s lenders actions are not controllable by harken 
if harken s projections of future operating results are not achieved and future waivers or amendments of the guaranty bank facility are not received and harken s debt is placed in default  harken will experience a material adverse impact on its financial position and results of operations 
the guaranty bank facility prohibits cash dividends  loans  advances and similar payments to be made to harken by the borrowers 
therefore  the borrowers will not be able to provide harken with funds to be used for the repayment of the notes  the waverley note or other debt obligations or for other uses  unless the borrowers obtain guaranty s consent 
if estimated discounted future net cash flows decrease  harken may be required to take additional writedowns 
harken periodically reviews the carrying value of its oil and gas properties under applicable full cost accounting rules 
these rules require a writedown of the carrying value of oil and gas properties if the carrying value exceeds the applicable estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves 
given the volatility of oil and gas prices  it is reasonably possible that the estimated discounted future net cash flows could change in the near term 
if oil and gas prices decline in the future  even if only for a short period of time  it is possible that additional writedowns of oil and gas properties could occur 
whether harken will be required to take such a charge will depend on the prices for oil and gas at the end of any quarter and the effect of reserve additions or revisions  property sales and capital expenditures during such quarter 
harken will be controlled by lyford as long as lyford owns a majority of the voting power of harken s common stock  and harken s other stockholders will be unable to affect the outcome of stockholder voting during this time 
as a result of harken s rights offering and the standby purchase agreement  lyford beneficially owns approximately of the combined voting power of harken s outstanding common stock and is able to determine the outcome of all corporate actions requiring stockholder approval 
because lyford has the ability to control harken  lyford has the power to act without taking the best interests of harken into consideration 
for example  lyford will control decisions with respect to 
the direction and policies of harken  including the election and removal of directors  
mergers or other business combinations involving harken  
the acquisition or disposition of assets by harken  
future issuances of harken s common stock or other securities  
the incurrence of debt by harken  
the payment of dividends  if any  on harken s common stock  and 
amendments to harken s certificate of incorporation and bylaws 
such concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a future change of control of harken 
risks associated with market conditions harken s stock price is volatile and the value of any investment in harken s common stock may fluctuate 
harken s stock price has been and is highly volatile  and harken believes this volatility is due to  among other things 
the results of harken s drilling  
current expectations of harken s future financial performance  
commodity prices of oil and natural gas  
the progress and ultimate success of harken s capital plan  including harken s actions with respect to its european notes  benz convertible notes and waverley note  and 
the volatility of the market in general 
for example  the common stock price has fluctuated from a high of per share to a low of per share over the last three years ending december  this volatility may affect the market value of harken s common stock in the future 
see part ii  item market for registrant s common equity and related stockholder matters 
future sales of harken s common stock pursuant to outstanding registration statements may affect the market price of harken s common stock 
there are currently several registration statements with respect to harken s common stock that are effective  pursuant to which certain of harken s stockholders may sell up to an aggregate of million shares of common stock 
any such sale of stock may also decrease the market price of harken s common stock 
harken may issue additional shares of common stock that may dilute the value of its common stock and adversely affect the market price of its common stock 
harken may issue additional shares of common stock in the following scenarios 
approximately million shares of common stock may be required to be issued pursuant to harken s stock options  
approximately million shares of common stock may be issued pursuant to other securities exercisable or exchangeable  or convertible into  shares of common stock  
approximately million shares of common stock may be issued in connection with the redemption of the waverley note maturing on september  assuming a redemption price of per share  
approximately million shares of common stock may be issued in connection with the redemption of the benz convertible notes maturing on november  assuming a redemption price of per share  
approximately million shares of common stock may be issued in connection with the redemption of the european notes maturing on may  assuming a redemption price of per share  
approximately million shares of common stock may be issued in connection with the conversion of the european notes maturing in and using the adjusted conversion rate of per share or the initial conversion rate of  as appropriate  and 
a significant number of additional shares of common stock may be issued for financing or other purposes 
a large issuance of shares of common stock in any or all of the above scenarios will decrease the ownership percentage of current outstanding stockholders and will likely result in a decrease in the market price of harken s common stock 
any large issuance will also likely result in a change in control of harken 
in addition  harken may elect to issue a significant number of additional shares of common stock for financing or other purposes  which could result in a decrease in the market price of harken s common stock 
if harken redeems its existing convertible notes with shares of common stock  stockholders will suffer a significant dilution of their ownership percentage and a decrease in the market value of harken s common stock and the redemptions may result in a change in control of harken 
any redemptions of harken s existing convertible notes involving a large issuance of shares could result in a substantial dilution of stockholders ownership percentage of harken s common stock and may result in a decrease in the market value of harken s common stock 
the number of new shares to be issued could also likely result in a change in control of harken and  depending on the ownership of the notes  a small group of stockholders could control the election of the board of directors and the approval of other matters presented for consideration by the stockholders  which could include mergers  acquisitions  amendments to harken s charter and various corporate governance actions 
stockholders may also incur immediate and likely substantial net asset dilution 
specifically  the redemption of the european notes  the benz convertible notes and the waverley note by converting them into common stock could likely result in substantial dilution of the existing harken common stock 
in addition  the number of new shares to be issued may result in a change of control of harken 
for example  if european notes or benz convertible notes had been redeemed with a redemption price of  for every  of european notes or benz convertible notes redeemed at this price  harken would be required to issue to the noteholders approximately million shares of common stock 
additionally  at this redemption price  harken would be required to issue to waverley approximately million shares of common stock to redeem the outstanding principal balance of the waverley note 
if all of the outstanding notes had been redeemed at this price  the noteholders would have received an aggregate of approximately million shares of common stock and  collectively  would control over of harken s common stock 
harken has issued shares of preferred stock with greater rights than its common stock and may issue additional shares of preferred stock in the future 
harken is permitted under harken s charter to issue up to million shares of preferred stock 
harken can issue shares of its preferred stock in one or more series and can set the terms of the preferred stock without seeking any further approval from its common stockholders 
any preferred stock that harken issues may rank ahead of harken s common stock in terms of dividend priority or liquidation premiums and may have greater voting rights than harken s common stock 
at march   harken had outstanding  shares of series g preferred stock and  shares of series g preferred stock 
these shares of preferred stock have rights senior to harken s common stock with respect to dividends and liquidation 
in addition  such preferred stock may be converted into shares of common stock  which could dilute the value of common stock to current stockholders and could adversely affect the market price of harken s common stock 
each share of series g preferred stock and series g preferred stock may be converted into shares of common stock at conversion prices of and per share of common stock  respectively  for each liquidation value of a share of such preferred stock plus the amount of any accrued and unpaid dividends 
harken s domestic operating strategic plan includes the acquisition of additional reserves through business combinations 
harken s domestic operations have shifted from primarily an exploration and development focus to an acquisition growth strategy  with a reduced emphasis on exploration 
harken is seeking additional acquisition opportunities to expand its domestic operations and increase its oil and gas reserves in north america 
harken may not be able to consummate future acquisitions on favorable terms 
additionally  any such future transactions may not achieve favorable financial results 
future business combinations may also involve the issuance of shares of harken s common stock  which could have a dilutive effect on stockholders percentage ownership 
harken may not have a sufficient number of authorized shares to issue in any such business combinations and harken may need to obtain stockholder approval to authorize additional shares for issuance 
further  the use of shares in business combinations will reduce the number of shares available for the redemption of existing convertible notes 
in addition  acquisitions may require substantial financial expenditures that will need to be financed through cash flow from operations or future debt and equity offerings by harken and harken may not be able to acquire companies or oil and gas properties using its equity as currency 
in the case of cash acquisitions  harken may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or obtain debt or equity financing sufficient to fund future acquisitions of reserves 
risks associated with harken s operations oil and gas price fluctuations in the market may adversely affect the results of harken s operations 
the results of harken s operations are highly dependent upon the prices received for harken s oil and natural gas production 
substantially all of harken s sales of oil and natural gas are made in the spot market  or pursuant to contracts based on spot market prices  and not pursuant to long term  fixed price contracts 
accordingly  the prices received for harken s oil and natural gas production are dependent upon numerous factors beyond harken s control 
these factors include the level of consumer product demand  governmental regulations and taxes  the price and availability of alternative fuels  the level of foreign imports of oil and natural gas and the overall economic environment 
significant declines in prices for oil and natural gas could have a material adverse effect on harken s financial condition  results of operations and quantities of reserves recoverable on an economic basis 
any significant decline in prices of oil or gas could have a material adverse effect on harken s financial condition and results of operations 
recently  the price of oil and natural gas has been volatile 
for example  during  the price for a barrel bbl of oil ranged from a high of to a low of and the price for a thousand cubic feet mcf of gas ranged from a high of to a low of 
during  the price for a bbl of oil ranged from a high of to a low of and the price for a mcf of gas ranged from a high of to a low of 
harken s operations require significant expenditures of capital that may not be recovered 
harken requires significant expenditures of capital in order to locate and acquire producing properties and to drill exploratory wells 
in conducting exploration and development activities from a particular well  the presence of unanticipated pressure or irregularities in formations  miscalculations or accidents may cause harken s exploration  development and production activities to be unsuccessful  potentially resulting in abandoning the well 
this could result in a total loss of harken s investment 
in addition  the cost and timing of drilling  completing and operating wells is difficult to predict 
the oil and gas harken produces may not be readily marketable at the time of production 
crude oil  natural gas  condensate and other oil and gas products are generally sold to other oil and gas companies  government agencies and other industries 
the availability of ready markets for oil and gas that harken might discover and the prices obtained for such oil and gas depend on many factors beyond harken s control  including 
the extent of local production and imports of oil and gas  
the proximity and capacity of pipelines and other transportation facilities  
fluctuating demand for oil and gas  
the marketing of competitive fuels  and 
the effects of governmental regulation of oil and gas production and sales 
natural gas associated with oil production is often not marketable due to demand or transportation limitations and is often flared at the producing well site 
pipeline facilities do not exist in certain areas of exploration and  therefore  any actual sales of discovered oil and gas might be delayed for extended periods until such facilities are constructed 
harken may encounter operating hazards that may result in substantial losses 
harken is subject to operating hazards normally associated with the exploration and production of oil and gas  including blowouts  explosions  oil spills  cratering  pollution  earthquakes  labor disruptions and fires 
the occurrence of any such operating hazards could result in substantial losses to harken due to injury or loss of life and damage to or destruction of oil and gas wells  formations  production facilities or other properties 
harken maintains insurance coverage limiting financial loss resulting from certain of these operating hazards 
harken does not maintain full insurance coverage for all matters that may adversely affect its operations  including war  terrorism  nuclear reactions  government fines  treatment of waste  blowout expenses and business interruptions 
losses and liabilities arising from uninsured or underinsured events could reduce harken s revenues or increase harken s costs 
there can be no assurance that any insurance will be adequate to cover losses or liabilities associated with operational hazards 
harken cannot predict the continued availability of insurance  or its availability at premium levels that justify its purchase 
drilling oil and gas wells particularly in certain regions of the united states and foreign countries could be hindered by hurricanes  earthquakes and other weather related operating risks 
harken s operations in the louisiana wetlands  the onshore regions of texas and in colombia  peru and panama are subject to risks from hurricanes and other natural disasters 
damage caused by hurricanes  earthquakes or other operating hazards could result in substantial losses to harken 
harken is not covered by insurance for any business interruption resulting from such events and  upon the occurrence of a natural disaster  this lack of coverage could have a material adverse effect on its financial position and results of operations 
harken faces strong competition from larger oil and gas companies  which could result in adverse effects on harken s business 
the exploration and production business is highly competitive 
many of harken s competitors have substantially larger financial resources  staffs and facilities 
harken s competitors in the united states include numerous major oil and gas exploration and production companies and in colombia  peru and panama include such major oil and gas companies as bp amoco  exxon mobil  texaco shell  conoco phillips and arco 
these major oil and gas companies are often better positioned to obtain the rights to exploratory acreage for which harken competes 
harken s operations are subject to various litigation that could have an adverse effect on its business 
presently  various harken subsidiaries are defendants in various litigation matters 
the nature of harken s and its subsidiaries operations also expose harken to further possible litigation claims in the future 
for example  harken is currently a party to the following pending proceedings 
in september  d 
e 
rice and karen rice  as trustees for the rice family living trust collectively referred to as rice filed a lawsuit against harken exploration company  a wholly owned subsidiary of harken  in texas state court 
rice claims damages in an amount of approximately million from harken exploration company s alleged spills on rice s property 

in december  energy investment  inc and eri investments  inc collectively referred to as energy filed a lawsuit against xplor energy  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of harken referred to as xplor  in delaware state court 
energy alleges that they are entitled to appraisal and payment of the fair value of their common stock in xplor as of the date xplor merged with harken 

in august  a new lawsuit was filed by new west resources  inc referred to as new west  a former xplor stockholder  against xplor  harken and other defendants in texas state court 
new west claims that it lost its million investment in xplor as a result of misrepresentations by xplor and breach of fiduciary duties by certain xplor directors 

in december  black point limited referred to as black point filed a lawsuit against global energy development ltd  a subsidiary of harken  in illinois federal court 
black point alleges that global energy development ltd  aided and abetted by officers of harken  fraudulently induced black point to spend time and money locating prospective business partners in the people s republic of china 
black point seeks breach of contract damages of million from global energy development ltd  that amount being black point s projected success fee on an unconsummated million investment by a chinese partner 
there is risk that any matter in litigation could be adversely decided against harken or its subsidiaries  regardless of their belief  opinion and position  which could have a material adverse effect on harken s financial condition and results of operations 
litigation is highly costly and the costs associated with defending litigation could also have a material adverse effect on harken s financial condition 
for further detail concerning harken s pending litigation  please see part i  item  legal proceedings 
compliance with  or breach of  environmental laws can be costly and could limit harken s operations 
harken s operations are subject to numerous and frequently changing laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection 
harken owns or leasees  and has in the past owned or leased  properties that have been used for the exploration and production of oil and gas and these properties and the wastes disposed on these properties may be subject to the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  the oil pollution act of  the resource conservation and recovery act  the federal water pollution control act and analogous state laws 
under such laws  harken could be required to remove or remediate previously released wastes or property contamination 
laws and regulations protecting the environment have generally become more stringent and  may in some cases  impose strict liability for environmental damage 
strict liability means that harken may be held liable for damage without regard to whether harken was negligent or otherwise at fault 
environmental laws and regulations may expose harken to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by others or for acts that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time they were performed 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the imposition of administrative  civil and criminal penalties 
while harken believes that its operations are in substantial compliance with existing requirements of governmental bodies  harken s ability to conduct continued operations is subject to satisfying applicable regulatory and permitting controls 
harken s current permits and authorizations and ability to get future permits and authorizations  particularly in foreign countries  may be susceptible  on a going forward basis  to increased scrutiny  greater complexity resulting in increased costs  or delays in receiving appropriate authorizations 
in particular  harken has experienced and may continue to experience delays in obtaining permits and authorization in colombia necessary for harken s operations 
in addition  recent judicial and political developments in costa rica have significantly and adversely affected harken s ability to acquire necessary environmental permits and severely limit the opportunity for future oil and gas exploration in costa rica 
as a result of these developments  harken fully impaired its investment through harken s subsidiary  global  in its onshore and offshore properties in costa rica  as reflected on harken s consolidated balance sheet  for the year ended december  harken is required to obtain an environmental permit or approval from the governments in colombia  costa rica  peru and panama prior to conducting seismic operations  drilling a well or constructing a pipeline in such foreign locations 
harken s operations in foreign countries have been delayed in the past and could be delayed in the future through the process of obtaining an environmental permit 
compliance with these laws and regulations may increase harken s costs of operations  as well as further restrict harken s foreign operations 
costa rica has implemented policies and laws with a high level of attention to the protection of its ecological areas and environment 
as a result  the operations of global s subsidiary  harken costa rica holdings  in costa rica are subject to much greater control  scrutiny and restrictions than are usually encountered in international exploration operations 
due to such additional regulations and requirements in costa rica  as well as recent rulings by costa rica government agencies  harken costa rica holdings will likely not be able to continue operations in costa rica for the foreseeable future 
harken s foreign operations involve substantial costs and are subject to certain risks because the oil and gas industries in such countries are less developed 
the oil and gas industries in colombia  costa rica  peru and panama are not as developed as the oil and gas industry in the united states 
as a result  harken s drilling and development operations in many instances take longer to complete and often cost more than similar operations in the united states 
the availability of technical expertise  specific equipment and supplies is more limited in colombia  costa rica  peru and panama than in the united states 
harken expects that such factors will continue to subject harken s international operations to economic and operating risks not experienced in harken s domestic operations 
harken follows the full cost method of accounting for exploration and development of oil and gas reserves in which all of its acquisition  exploration and development costs are capitalized 
costs related to the acquisition  holding and initial exploration of oil and gas associated with harken s contracts in countries with no proved reserves are initially capitalized  including internal costs directly identified with acquisition  exploration and development activities 
if harken abandons all exploration efforts in a country where no proved reserves are assigned  all acquisition and exploration costs associated with the country are expensed 
from time to time  harken makes assessments as to whether its investment within a country is impaired and whether exploration activities within a country will be abandoned based on its analysis of drilling results  seismic data and other information it believes to be relevant 
due to the unpredictable nature of exploration drilling activities  the amount and timing of impairment expenses are difficult to predict 
if harken fails to comply with the terms of certain contracts related to its foreign operations  it could lose its rights under each of those contracts 
the terms of each of the colombia association contracts  the costa rica contract  the peruvian technical evaluation agreement and the panamanian technical evaluation agreement require that harken perform certain activities  such as seismic interpretations and the drilling of required wells  in accordance with those contracts and agreements 
harken s failure to timely perform those activities as required could result in the loss of its rights under a particular contract  which would likely result in a significant loss to harken 
as of march   harken was in compliance with the requirements of each of the colombia association contracts  the peruvian technical evaluation agreement and the panamanian technical evaluation agreement 
for further detail concerning these contracts and agreements  please see part i  item  business 
harken requires significant additional financing for its foreign operations  which financing may not be available 
harken anticipates that full development of its existing and future oil and gas discoveries and prospects in colombia  peru and panama may take several years and require significant additional capital expenditures 
if harken is unable to timely obtain adequate funds to finance these investments  harken s ability to develop oil and gas reserves in these countries may be severely limited or substantially delayed 
such limitations or delay would likely result in substantial losses for harken and global 
harken anticipates that amounts required to fund global s foreign activities will be funded from existing cash balances  asset sales  stock issuances  production payments  operating cash flows and from joint venture partners 
harken estimates a cost of million in for the completion of a well in colombia required to be drilled by global pursuant to the cajaro association contract with empresa colombia de petroleos 
the exact usage of other future funding sources is unknown at this time and there can be no assurance that global will have adequate funds available to finance its foreign operations 
harken s foreign operations are subject to political  economic and other uncertainties 
global currently conducts significant operations in colombia  peru and panama and may also conduct operations in other foreign countries in the future 
at december   approximately of harken s proved reserves and of harken s consolidated revenues were related to global s colombian operations 
exploration and production operations in foreign countries are subject to political  economic and other uncertainties  including 
the risk of war  revolution  border disputes  expropriation  renegotiation or modification of existing contracts  import  export and transportation regulations and tariffs resulting in loss of revenue  property and equipment  
taxation policies  including royalty and tax increases and retroactive tax claims  
exchange controls  currency fluctuations and other uncertainties arising out of foreign government sovereignty over international operations  
laws and policies of the united states affecting foreign trade  taxation and investment  and 
the possibility of being subjected to the jurisdiction of foreign courts in connection with legal disputes and the possible inability to subject foreign persons to the jurisdiction of courts in the united states 
central and south america and certain other regions of the world have a history of political and economic instability 
this instability could result in new governments or the adoption of new policies  laws or regulations that might assume a substantially more hostile attitude toward foreign investment 
in an extreme case  such a change could result in termination of contract rights and expropriation of foreign owned assets 
any such activity could result in a significant loss to harken and global 
guerrilla activity in colombia could disrupt or delay global s operations  and harken is concerned about safeguarding global s operations and personnel in colombia 
colombia s year armed conflict between the government and leftist guerrilla groups has escalated in recent years 
the current government s quest for peace was unsuccessful 
the breakdown of peace negotiations has resulted in increased military action by the colombian government directed against the rebel groups operating in colombia 
unless the parties determine to return to peace negotiations  the military confrontation with the rebel groups is expected to continue 
also  the increased activity of right wing paramilitary groups  formed in opposition to the left wing farc and eln groups  has contributed to the escalation in violence 
the increase in violence has affected business interests in colombia 
targeting such enterprises as symbols of foreign exploitation  particularly in the north of the country  the rebel groups have attempted to hamper production of hydrocarbons 
the cumulative effect of escalation in the armed conflict and the resulting unstable political and security situation has led to increased risks and costs and the downgrading of colombia s country risk rating 
global s oil and gas operations are in areas outside guerrilla control and with the exception of its increased security requirements  harken s operations continue mostly unaffected  although from time to time  guerilla activity in colombia has delayed harken s projects there 
this guerilla activity has increased over the last few years  causing delays in the development of harken s fields in colombia 
guerilla activity  such as road blockades  has also from time to time slowed harken s deployment of workers in the field and affected harken s operations 
in addition  guerillas could attempt to disrupt the flow of harken s production through pipelines 
in addition to these security issues  harken has also become the subject of media focus in colombia that may further compromise harken s security position in the country 
there can be no assurance that attempts to reduce or prevent guerilla activity will be successful or that guerilla activity will not disrupt global s operations in the future 
there can also be no assurance that global can maintain the safety of its operations and personnel in colombia or that this violence will not affect its operations in the future 
continued or heightened security concerns in colombia could also result in a significant loss to harken and global 
the united states government may impose economic or trade sanctions on colombia that could result in a significant loss to harken and global 
colombia is among several nations whose progress in stemming the production and transit of illegal drugs is subject to annual certification by the president of the united states 
although colombia was so certified in  there can be no assurance that  in the future  colombia will receive certification or a national interest waiver 
the failure to receive certification or a national interest waiver may result in any of the following 
all bilateral aid  except anti narcotics and humanitarian aid  would be suspended  
the export import bank of the united states and the overseas private investment corporation would not approve financing for new projects in colombia  
united states representatives at multilateral lending institutions would be required to vote against all loan requests from colombia  although such votes would not constitute vetoes  and 
the president of the united states and congress would retain the right to apply future trade sanctions 
each of these consequences could result in adverse economic consequences in colombia and could further heighten the political and economic risks associated with harken s operations there 
any changes in the holders of significant government offices could have adverse consequences on harken s relationship with the colombian national oil company and the colombian government s ability to control guerrilla activities and could exacerbate the factors relating to harken s foreign operations discussed above 
any sanctions imposed on colombia by the united states government could threaten harken s ability to obtain necessary financing to develop the colombian properties or cause colombia to retaliate against harken  including by nationalizing harken s colombian assets 
accordingly  the imposition of the foregoing economic and trade sanctions on colombia would likely result in a substantial loss to harken and global and a decrease in the price of harken s common stock 
harken can give no assurance that the united states will not impose sanctions on colombia in the future or predict the effect in colombia that these sanctions might cause 
harken may suffer losses from exchange rate fluctuations 
harken accounts for its colombian  costa rican  peruvian and panamanian operations using the us dollar as the functional currency 
the costs associated with harken s exploration efforts in colombia  costa rica  peru and panama have typically been denominated in us dollars 
harken expects that a substantial portion of its future colombian revenues may be denominated in colombian pesos 
to the extent that the amount of harken s revenues denominated in colombian pesos is greater than the amount of costs denominated in colombian pesos  harken could suffer a loss if the value of the colombian peso were to drop relative to the value of the us dollar 
any substantial currency fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on harken s results of operations 
in recent years the value of the colombian peso relative to the us dollar has declined 
for example  the average exchange rate for the colombian peso into us dollars for december was  as compared to an average of for december and for december properties and locations production and revenues see also note oil and gas disclosures in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in part ii  item of this annual report on form k for certain information about harken s proved oil and gas reserves

collectively energy filed a lawsuit against xplor energy  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of harken xplor  on december  in the new castle county court of chancery of the state of delaware 
energy alleges that they are entitled to appraisal and payment of the fair value of their common stock in xplor as of the date xplor merged with harken 
harken has relied on an indemnity provision in the xplor merger agreement to tender the costs of defense in this matter to former stockholders of xplor 
although the outcome of this litigation is uncertain  because the former stockholders of xplor have accepted indemnification of this claim  harken believes that any liability to harken as a result of this litigation will not have a material adverse effect on harken s financial condition

new west claims that it lost its million investment in xplor as a result of misrepresentations by xplor and breach of fiduciary duties by certain xplor directors 
harken believes this new suit is an adjunct of the prior appraisal rights claim by energy 
the former stockholders of xplor have rejected harken s request for indemnification of this claim under the xplor merger agreement 
however  harken intends to continue to pursue and enforce  through whatever steps are necessary  any indemnification from the third parties 
harken has tendered the defense of this claim to national union fire insurance company  pursuant to insurance policy coverage held by xplor 
national union has accepted defense of this claim subject to a reservation of rights 
based on the facts that i the allegations of new west s current petition focus primarily on defendants other than harken  ii new west has provided no evidence supporting its claims in response to harken s discovery requests and iii new west has not served process upon other defendants described in new west s petition as being the primary wrongdoers  harken does not believe the claims asserted against harken are meritorious 
therefore  in harken management s opinion  the ultimate outcome of this litigation will not have a material adverse effect on harken s financial condition

under theories of fraudulent inducement  quantum merit  and detrimental reliance

harken and global ltd
