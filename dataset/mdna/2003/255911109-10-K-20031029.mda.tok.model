the asp segment provides processing  print  mail  archival and internet delivery of documents for customers who outsource these activities

asp hosting revenue consists of fees earned from customers who outsource the production of customer statements and insurance policies 
professional services revenue includes fees for implementation  integration  training and consulting services 
license revenue is generally derived from perpetual licenses of software products 
maintenance revenue consists primarily of recurring license fees and annual software maintenance and support agreements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the accompanying management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experiences and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis 
actual results may differ from previously estimated amounts under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  which involve significant judgments and estimates  are used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position  software revenue recognition sop  and staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
revenues are derived from the sale of software licenses  annual software maintenance and support agreements  professional services and asp hosting services 
revenue is recognized when a contract exists  the fee is fixed or determinable  delivery has occurred and collection of the receivable is deemed probable 
we use the residual method to recognize revenue from the sale of software licenses that are bundled with maintenance and support 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered element s is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue 
fair value of an element is based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
vsoe is based on the price charged when the same element is sold separately 
we do not generally sell software licenses without selling maintenance and support for the licensed software 
therefore  we have established vsoe only for the undelivered element s included in a multi element arrangement 
specifically  vsoe for maintenance and support is based upon the price a customer pays to renew its maintenance and support agreement 
after expiration of the initial maintenance term  maintenance and support agreements are renewable on an annual basis and include rights to upgrades  when and if available  telephone support  updates  enhancements and bug fixes 
revenue generated from maintenance and support is recognized ratably over the maintenance term of the agreement 
we record deferred revenue for maintenance amounts invoiced prior to the performance of the related services 
our standard license agreements do not provide for rights of software return and or conditions of acceptance 
however  in the rare case that acceptance criteria are provided  revenue is deferred and not recognized until all acceptance provisions are satisfied 
revenue from software licenses  which include a cancellation clause  is recognized upon expiration of the cancellation period 
revenue related to products still in the testing phase is deferred until formal acceptance of the product by the customer 
professional services revenue includes implementation  integration  training and consulting services related to our software products 
the services offered are not essential to the functionality of the software sold 
professional services revenue is generally recognized as the services are performed 
revenue derived from the installation and integration of software packages under a fixed price contract is recognized on a percentage of completion basis measured by the relationship of hours worked to total estimated contract hours 
we follow this method because reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and contract hours applicable to various elements of a contract can be made 
since the financial reporting of these contracts depends upon estimates  which are assessed continually during the term of these contracts  recognized revenue and profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
revisions in profit estimates are reflected in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revisions become known 
accordingly  favorable changes in estimates result in additional revenue recognition and net income  and unfavorable changes in estimates result in a reduction of recognized revenue and net income 
when estimates indicate that a loss will be incurred on a contract upon completion  a provision for the expected loss is recorded in the period in which the loss becomes evident 
revenue from our asp hosting operations is recognized in accordance with sab  generally on a per transaction basis 
asp hosting agreements are generally one to five years in duration and provide for monthly billing based on transaction volume or contract minimums  if applicable 
revenue related to the customer s initial set up and implementation is deferred and subsequently recognized over the expected term of the asp hosting agreement 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we take into consideration the current financial condition of our customers  the specific details of the customer accounts  the age of the outstanding balance and the current economic environment when assessing the adequacy of the allowance 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required 
software development costs software development costs are accounted for in accordance with either statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed  or with statement of position no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
the guidance above requires the capitalization of certain software development costs once technological feasibility is established 
the capitalized costs are then amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated product life  or on the ratio of current revenues to total projected product revenues  whichever is greater 
management periodically assesses the realizability of software development costs when events and circumstances indicate a potential decline in value 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill we recognize an impairment charge associated with our long lived assets  including property and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets whenever we determine that recovery of such long lived asset is not probable 
such determination is made in accordance with the applicable gaap requirement associated with the long lived asset  and is based upon  among other things  estimates of the amount of future net cash flows to be generated by the long lived asset and estimates of the current fair value of the asset 
adverse changes in future net cash flows or fair value could result in the inability to recover the carrying value of the long lived asset  thereby requiring an impairment charge to be recognized 
we perform an impairment analysis in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  annually and whenever events and circumstances indicate that an impairment might be present 
deferred taxes and valuation allowance we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred income tax assets to the amount that is believed to be realized under the more likely than not recognition criteria 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  it is possible that in the future we may change our estimate of the amount of the deferred income tax assets that would more likely than not be realized in the future  resulting in an adjustment to the deferred income tax assets valuation allowance that would either increase or decrease  as applicable  reported net income in the period such change in estimate was made 
translation of foreign currency we translate the financial statements of our european subsidiary into us dollars in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 foreign currency translation 
assets and liabilities of our european subsidiary  whose functional currency is other than the us dollar  are translated at period end rates of exchange  and revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the period 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recognized in income as incurred 
we account for unrealized gains or losses on our foreign currency translation adjustments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 reporting comprehensive income  which requires adjustments to be accumulated in stockholders equity as part of other comprehensive income 
currently  we do not engage in foreign currency hedging activities
