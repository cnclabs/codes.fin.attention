 goodwill and other intangible assets 
all per share data has been restated to reflect the stock dividend distributed on december  the increase in earnings is reflected in the corporation s performance ratios 
return on average assets for was compared to and in and  respectively  and return on average equity for was compared to and for and  respectively 
the corporation s assets remained relatively flat from december  to december  at billion 
the corporation s consolidated balance sheet reflects the state of the us economy during the past year with weak commercial loan demand  increased residential mortgage loan refinancing  and record low interest rates 
the loan portfolio at billion decreased from the billion at prior year end 
total deposits at billion decreased from december  the corporation continues to have a high level of liquidity due to the weak loan demand and low yielding investment options 
with limited investment opportunity and high liquidity  the corporation has been pricing its interest bearing deposits at the mid range of its competitors to manage its interest margin 
charter changes effective january   the bank and the trust company converted their charters to state charters from national associations 
the bank remained a member of the federal reserve system following conversion 
following its conversion  the trust company changed its name from trust company of kentucky  national association to community trust and investment company in order to identify more closely the trust company with the bank 
while the corporation believes that the conversions resulted in some reduction in expenses  the conversions did not result in any changes in the management or operations of the bank or the trust company 
acquisitions on january   community trust bank  inc  the corporation s lead bank  acquired the deposits  loans  and fixed assets of the bank of mt 
vernon  inc the offices acquired from the bank of mt 
vernon  inc 
are located in mt 
vernon  somerset  richmond  and berea  kentucky 
the offices acquired had deposits totaling million and loans totaling million 
the purchase price paid by community trust bank  inc for the offices was a premium on the non brokered deposits as of the closing date plus approximately million for fixed assets  million for investment securities  and million for the cash held at the acquired branches of the bank of mt 
vernon  inc during the third quarter of  the corporation acquired of the outstanding shares of citizens national bank and trust  hazard  kentucky citizens independently valued at that time at million in lieu of a debt owed to the corporation by a citizens shareholder 
on january   the corporation acquired the remaining of citizens for million 
citizens had total assets of million and equity capital of million as of december  on march   citizens was merged into community trust bank  inc critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies  many of which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates 
such differences could be material to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe application of accounting policies and the estimates required therein are reasonable 
these accounting policies and estimates are constantly reevaluated  and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
historically  we have found our application of accounting policies to be appropriate  and actual results have not differed materially from those determined using necessary estimates 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we have identified the following critical accounting policies loans are reported at the carrying value of unpaid principal reduced by unearned interest and an allowance for loan losses 
income is recorded on the level yield basis 
interest accrual is discontinued when management believes  after considering economic and business conditions  collateral value  and collection efforts  that the borrower s financial condition is such that collection of interest is doubtful 
any loan greater than days past due must be well secured and in the process of collection to continue accruing interest 
cash payments received on nonaccrual loans generally are applied against principal  and interest income is only recorded once principal recovery is reasonably assured 
loans are not reclassified as accruing until principal and interest payments are brought current and future payments appear reasonably certain 
the adequacy of the allowance is reviewed quarterly by management using a methodology that includes several key factors 
the corporation utilizes an internal risk grading system for commercial credits  and those larger commercial credits identified through this grading system as having weaknesses are individually reviewed for the customer s ability and potential to repay their loans 
the borrower s cash flow  adequacy of collateral held for the loan  and other options available to the corporation including legal avenues are all evaluated 
based upon this individual credit evaluation  a specific allocation to the allowance may be made for the loan 
consumer installment and residential mortgage loans are not individually risk graded 
allowance allocations are provided for these pools of loans based upon an eight quarter moving average historical loss rate for each of these categories of loans 
for other commercial loans that are not individually evaluated  an allowance allocation is determined by applying an eight quarter moving average historical loss rate for this group of loans 
an unallocated portion of the allowance is also determined in recognition of the inherent inability to precisely determine the loss potential in any particular loan or pool of loans 
the factors considered by management in determining this amount of inherent risk include delinquency trends  current economic conditions and trends  strength of the supervision and administration of the loan portfolio  level of nonperforming loans  trend in loan losses  recovery rates associated with previously charged off loans  concentrations within commercial credits  problem loan identification strengths and weaknesses  collateral evaluation strengths and weaknesses  and level of financial statement exceptions 
these factors are reviewed quarterly and weighted as deemed appropriate by management 
the total of these weighted factors is then applied against the total loan portfolio and the allowance is adjusted accordingly 
the corporation has not substantively changed any aspect of its overall approach in the determination of the allowance for loan losses  except converting to an eight quarter moving average for determining historical loss rates  using specific allocations for homogenous pools of loans  and applying the inherent risk factors discussed above against the total loan portfolio instead of against the preliminary allowance calculation as was done previously 
there have been no material changes in assumptions or estimation techniques as compared to prior years that impacted the determination of the current year allowance 
mortgage loans originated and intended for sale in the secondary market are carried at the lower of cost or estimated market value in the aggregate 
net unrealized losses  if any  are recognized in a separate valuation allowance for loans held for sale by charges to income 
securities are classified as held to maturity or available for sale on the date of purchase 
only those securities classified as held to maturity  and which management has the intent and ability to hold to maturity  are reported at amortized cost 
available for sale securities are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses  net of related deferred income taxes  included in accumulated other comprehensive income 
the fair value of a security is determined based on quoted market prices 
if quoted market prices are not available  fair value is determined based on quoted prices of similar instruments 
realized securities gains or losses would be reported within noninterest income in the consolidated statements of income 
the cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method 
held to maturity and available for sale securities are reviewed quarterly for possible other than temporary impairment 
the review includes an analysis of the facts and circumstances of each individual investment such as the length of time the fair value has been below cost  the expectation for that security s performance  the credit worthiness of the issuer and the corporation s ability to hold the security to maturity 
a decline in value that is considered to be other than temporary would be recorded as a loss within noninterest income in the consolidated statements of income 
the corporation evaluates total goodwill for impairment  based upon statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets and sfas no 
 acquisitions of certain financial institutions  using fair value techniques including multiples of price equity 
goodwill is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis 
effect of accounting change effective january   the corporation adopted sfas no 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
sfas no 
also requires that intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values and reviewed for impairment 
the corporation evaluated total goodwill for impairment upon adoption of sfas no 
and sfas no 
concluding that there is no impairment as determined by evaluating goodwill using fair value techniques including multiples of price equity 
upon adoption  the corporation ceased amortizing goodwill of approximately million arising from previous purchase transactions 
this will reduce amortization expense on an annual basis by million and increase earnings on an annual basis by million 
goodwill will continue to be evaluated for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
year to date earnings were positively impacted by per share due to the implementation of sfas no 
the following tables show on a pro forma basis the results for the twelve months ended december  and had sfas no 
been implemented on january  amortization of core deposit intangible for the twelve months ended december  was thousand 
anticipated amortization for the next five years is thousand annually

during  as liabilities matured  our depositors elected to shorten the term of their deposits and consequently by december  our consolidated balance sheet had become negatively gapped 
during  the corporation sold securities and reinvested in securities with shorter maturities to offset the shortened term of its liabilities 
consequently  at december  the corporation s gap position was relatively flat 
provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses the provision for loan losses that was added to the allowance was million as of december  compared to million for this provision represents a charge against current earnings in order to maintain the allowance at an appropriate level 
loan losses  net of recoveries  as a percentage of average loans outstanding were in compared to in as net loan losses were million for compared to million for our reserve for losses on loans and leases as a percentage of total loans outstanding increased from the of december  to at december  the increase in reserve for losses on loans from prior year was reflective of current weak economic conditions 
nonperforming loans decreased from prior year 
nonperforming loans on december  were million compared to million at december  the significant decline in nonperforming loans is attributable to the payout of one commercial problem loan totaling million and the corporation s continuing focus on asset quality during this weak period in the economy 
specific reserves are established for all large loans where a loss may occur  therefore  no significant losses are anticipated except for those loans with specific reserve allocations 
the adequacy of the allowance is reviewed quarterly by management using a methodology that includes several key factors 
the corporation utilizes an internal risk grading system for commercial credits  and those larger commercial credits identified through this grading system as having weaknesses are individually reviewed for the customer s ability and potential to repay their loans

there have been no material changes in assumptions or estimation techniques as compared to prior years that impacted the determination of the current year allowance 
noninterest income noninterest income for the year ended december  of million was a increase from the million earned during the same period in the increase in noninterest income for the year ended december  is primarily the result of increased deposit service charge revenue due to the implementation of our overdraft honor program  increased gains on sales of residential real estate loans due to increased refinancing activity  and increased gains on sales of securities 
while the increase in residential real estate loan refinancing activity  due to the low interest rate environment  resulted in higher noninterest income from the gains on sales of loans  noninterest income was negatively impacted by the establishment of a valuation reserve of million for the year to capitalized mortgage loan servicing rights 
noninterest expense noninterest expense increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase in noninterest expense for the year was primarily attributable to an increase in personnel expense due to the filling of budgeted key positions within the corporation  an increase in salaries due to base salary costs associated with the acquisition of our hazard market  incentives earned by employees under our performance incentive program  and annual merit increases 
our efficiency ratio was at year end compared to at year end the deposit to fte full time equivalent ratio remained flat at million from december  to december  salaries and employee benefits in were million compared to million in occupancy expense was million in compared to million in equipment expense remained flat at million 
data processing costs were million in compared to million in  and stationery  printing  and office supplies were million compared to million in taxes other than payroll  property  and income  which consists mainly of franchise taxes on the equity and deposits of the corporation  were million compared to million in fdic insurance expense was thousand compared to thousand in other categories of noninterest expense were million in compared to million in compared to net income for was relatively flat with at million 
basic earnings per share for were compared to per share for the average shares outstanding in and were million and million  respectively 
net interest income for decreased compared to from million in to million in noninterest income increased from million in to million in while noninterest expense increased from million in to million in return on average assets decreased from in to in  and return on average equity decreased from in to in net interest income although a decline in the corporation s net interest margin was anticipated as the economy began to weaken during and interest rates began to decline in january  the magnitude of the decrease in interest rates was not anticipated 
the corporation s net interest margin was negatively impacted by the repricing of assets quicker than liabilities through the first eight months of the corporation was seeing some relief on its margin during september when the national disaster of september  prompted an additional lowering of interest rates by the federal open market committee 
the basis point decline in market interest rates during resulted in a basis point decline in our net interest margin from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  for further information  see the table titled consolidated average balance sheets and taxable equivalent income expense and yields rates in the selected statistical information 
the corporation s average earning assets increased from billion in to billion in average interest bearing liabilities also increased during the period  from billion in to billion in average interest bearing liabilities as a percentage of average earning assets decreased from in to in the taxable equivalent yield on average earning assets decreased from in to in the cost of average interest bearing liabilities also decreased during the same period from to 
the yield on interest bearing assets was impacted by the change in the earning asset mix as well as by the decrease in market rates in loans accounted for of all earning assets in while loans accounted for of earning assets in loans accounted for of total assets as of december  compared to as of december  the corporation s consolidated balance sheet on december  was positively gapped over a twelve month period 
during  as liabilities matured  our depositors elected to shorten the term of their deposits and consequently by december  our consolidated balance sheet had become negatively gapped 
provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses the provision for loan losses that was added to the allowance remained relatively flat at million from to this provision represented a charge against current earnings in order to maintain the allowance at an appropriate level 
loan losses  net of recoveries  as a percentage of average loans outstanding increased from in to in as net loan losses increased by million in to million 
as was discussed in our june  and september  earnings releases  million of the increase in net loan losses is the result of the bank s recognition of the loss on one large commercial credit for which a specific allocation of loss allowance had been established 
the allowance declined from of total loans at december  to at december  the decline in the allowance as a percentage of total loans was primarily the result of the addition of million in loans from the mt 
vernon and hazard acquisitions to the corporation s loan portfolio which did not require a corresponding addition to the corporation s loan loss allowance an impact to the allowance ratio of basis points and the one large commercial loan loss mentioned above for which a specific allocation of the allowance had previously been made 
nonperforming loans  which are mainly commercial credits  increased from of total loans at december  to at december  the increase was primarily due to a few commercial real estate loans with problems unrelated to the economy of the markets where they are located 
noninterest income noninterest income increased from million in to million in  due to an increase in service charges on deposit accounts  gains on sales of loans  and securities gains 
service charges on deposit related products generated million for the year  as compared to million for the previous year 
factors impacting the increase in service charges on deposits were increasing the overdraft fee by in the first quarter of and increasing our deposit base by million in january with the acquisition of the branches of the bank of mt 
vernon and by million in october with the acquisition of citizens 
the gains on sales of loans increased from million in to million in  a result of a increase in the dollar volume of residential mortgage loans sold in compared to this increase in volume was primarily the result of refinancing existing mortgages as customers took advantage of historically low mortgage interest rates 
securities gains increased from thousand in to thousand in other noninterest income increased from million in to million in trust income remained flat from to at million 
noninterest expense noninterest expense for the year ended december  was million  a increase from the million for the year ended december  the increase in noninterest expense was primarily attributable to the operating expenses associated with the addition of the five banking offices acquired from the bank of mt 
vernon  inc on january  and the addition of a controlling interest in citizens on october  the additional expenses were also reflected in our efficiency ratio which increased basis points from at year end to at year end the deposit to fte full time equivalent ratio decreased from million to million year over year 
salaries and employee benefits increased from million in to million in occupancy expense increased from million in to million in while equipment expense decreased from million to million  respectively 
data processing costs increased from million in to million in  and stationery  printing  and office supplies increased from million in to million in taxes other than payroll  property  and income  which consisted mainly of franchise taxes on the equity and deposits of the corporation  increased from million in to million in fdic insurance expense increased from thousand in to thousand in other categories of noninterest expense increased from million in to million in liquidity and market risk the objective of the corporation s asset liability management function is to maintain consistent growth in net interest income within the corporation s policy limits 
this objective is accomplished through management of the corporation s consolidated balance sheet composition  liquidity  and interest rate risk exposures arising from changing economic conditions  interest rates and customer preferences 
the goal of liquidity management is to provide adequate funds to meet changes in loan and lease demand or unexpected deposit withdrawals 
this is accomplished by maintaining liquid assets in the form of investment securities  maintaining sufficient unused borrowing capacity  and growth in core deposits 
as of december   the corporation had approximately million in securities valued at estimated fair value designated as available for sale and available to meet liquidity needs on a continuing basis 
additional asset driven liquidity is provided by the remainder of the securities portfolio and the repayment of loans 
these sources  in addition to the corporation s average equity capital base  provide a stable funding base 
in addition to core deposit funding  the corporation also accesses a variety of other short term and long term funding sources 
the corporation also relies on federal home loan bank advances for both liquidity and management of its asset liability position 
federal home loan bank advances were million at december  compared to million at december  the corporation generally relies upon net inflows of cash from financing activities  supplemented by net inflows of cash from operating activities  to provide cash for its investing activities 
as is typical of many financial institutions  significant financing activities include deposit gathering  use of short term borrowing facilities such as federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements  and issuance of long term debt 
the corporation currently has a million revolving line of credit  all of which is currently available to meet any future cash needs 
the corporation s primary investing activities include purchases of securities and loan originations 
management does not rely on any one source of liquidity and manages availability in response to changing consolidated balance sheet needs 
the corporation began a program of stock repurchase in december with the authorization to acquire up to  shares 
the corporation issued a press release in july announcing its intention to repurchase up to an additional  shares 
during  the corporation continued its stock repurchase program which continues to be accretive to shareholder value 
through this program  the corporation repurchased    and  shares during    and  respectively 
management considers interest rate risk the corporation s most significant market risk 
interest rate risk is the exposure to adverse changes in net interest income due to changes in interest rates 
consistency of the corporation s net interest revenue is largely dependent upon the effective management of interest rate risk 
the corporation employs a variety of measurement techniques to identify and manage its interest rate risk including the use of an earnings simulation model to analyze net interest income sensitivity to changing interest rates 
the model is based on actual cash flows and repricing characteristics for on and off balance sheet instruments and incorporates market based assumptions regarding the effect of changing interest rates on the prepayment rates of certain assets and liabilities 
assumptions based on the historical behavior of deposit rates and balances in relation to changes in interest rates are also incorporated into the model 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain  and as a result  the model cannot precisely measure net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in interest rates on net interest income 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude  and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies 
the corporation s asset liability management committee alco  which includes executive and senior management representatives and reports to the board of directors  monitors and manages interest rate risk within board approved policy limits 
the corporation s current interest rate risk policy limits are determined by measuring the anticipated change in net interest income over a twelve month horizon assuming a basis point immediate and sustained increase or decrease in all interest rates 
the following table shows the corporation s estimated earnings sensitivity profile as of december  change in interest rates basis points percentage change in net interest income months the following table shows the corporation s estimated earnings sensitivity profile as of december  change in interest rates basis points percentage change in net interest income months given an immediate and sustained basis point increase in the yield curve used in the simulation model  it is estimated that net interest income for the corporation would increase by over one year 
a basis point immediate and sustained decrease in interest rates would decrease net interest income by over one year 
in order to reduce the exposure to interest rate fluctuations and to manage liquidity  the corporation has developed sale procedures for several types of interest sensitive assets 
all long term  fixed rate single family residential mortgage loans underwritten according to federal home loan mortgage corporation guidelines are sold for cash upon origination 
periodically  additional assets such as commercial loans are also sold 
in and  million and million  respectively  was realized on the sale of fixed rate residential mortgages 
management focuses its efforts on consistent net interest revenue and net interest margin growth through each of the retail and wholesale business lines 
the corporation does not currently engage in trading activities 
capital resources total shareholders equity at december  was million compared to million at december  the primary source of capital growth for the corporation is retained earnings 
cash dividends were per share for and per share for the corporation retained of its earnings in regulatory guidelines require bank holding companies  commercial banks  and savings banks to maintain certain minimum ratios and define companies as well capitalized that sufficiently exceed the minimum ratios 
the banking regulators may alter minimum capital requirements as a result of revising their internal policies and their ratings of individual institutions 
to be well capitalized banks and bank holding companies must maintain a tier leverage ratio of no less than  a tier risk based ratio of no less than  and a total risk based ratio of no less than 
the corporation s ratios as of december  were   and  respectively 
community trust bancorp  inc and all banking affiliates met the criteria for well capitalized at december  see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
on february   the corporation issued an additional million of trust preferred securities through an issuance by ctbi preferred capital trust ii  a wholly owned subsidiary grantor trust 
the trust preferred securities bear interest at an annual rate of  have a redemption date of march   and mature on march  proceeds of million from this offering were used to pay off a revolving line of credit  million was used for payment of the redemption of senior notes on february as of december   management is not aware of any current recommendations by banking regulatory authorities which  if they were to be implemented  would have  or are reasonably likely to have  a material adverse impact on the corporation s liquidity  capital resources  or operations 
impact of inflation  changing prices and local economic conditions the majority of the corporation s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
therefore  the corporation differs greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in non monetary assets  such as fixed assets and inventories 
however  inflation does have an important impact on the growth of assets in the banking industry and on the resulting need to increase equity capital at higher than normal rates in order to maintain an appropriate equity to assets ratio 
inflation also affects other expenses  which tend to rise during periods of general inflation 
management believes the most significant impact on financial and operating results is the corporation s ability to react to changes in interest rates 
management seeks to maintain an essentially balanced position between interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to protect against the effects of wide interest rate fluctuations 
our success is dependent on the general economic conditions of the communities we serve 
unlike larger banks that are more geographically diversified  we provide financial and banking services primarily to eastern  northeast  central  and south central kentucky and southern west virginia 
the economies of a majority of these markets are dependent to a significant extent on the coal industry and coal related industries 
the economic conditions in these areas have a significant impact on loan demand  the ability of borrowers to repay these loans  and the value of the collateral securing these loans 
a significant decline in general economic conditions  and in particular the coal industry  will affect these local economic conditions and will negatively affect the financial results of our banking operations 
factors influencing general conditions include inflation  recession  unemployment  and other factors beyond our control
