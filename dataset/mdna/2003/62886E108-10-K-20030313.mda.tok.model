sfas  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
although such exclusions result in financial information that differs from generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states  it is useful to investors because it includes the same information that is used by our management to assess our overall financial performance and the financial performance of our operating segments 
moreover  this non gaap information excludes items that reflect management decisions made for the long term benefit of our company overall  but which may have a disproportional impact  either positively or negatively  within the reporting period  or exclude events that occur infrequently and therefore do not reflect ongoing operational performance within the period 
the effects of pension income  goodwill amortization  and other special items as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements have been excluded from the operating income for each reporting segment presented and discussed below 
our segment results are reconciled to total company gaap results in note of notes to consolidated financial statements

growth in the americas region was related to upgrades and purchases by top tier banks and eleven s purchase of our advanced function atms 
growth experienced in the asia pacific region was primarily driven by strong markets in china and india as an increasing number of financial institutions in these countries are installing atms for the first time 
the operating income decline in versus the prior year was mainly due to lower product revenue and competitive pressure in europe

the change was made based on actual recent experience factors

the cash generated from operations in was driven by operating profitability and was partially offset by negative net working capital and disbursements for employee severance and pension 
net working capital was impacted by a million increase in receivables largely relating to the discontinuation of receivables factoring in the cash generated in was driven by operating profitability and improved asset management  specifically accounts receivable  partially offset by disbursements for employee severance and pension

the net use of cash in investing activities in  and primarily represented net capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment  reworkable service parts and additions to capitalized software 
capital expenditures were million  million and million for the years ended  and  respectively 
proceeds from sales of property  plant and equipment are primarily driven by our continued focus to reduce our excess real estate 
we have progressively reduced our capital spending due to the challenging economic climate and we will continue to manage our capital expenditures below our depreciation and amortization expense 
in  we reduced our net short term investment position by million to fund acquisition activities 
net cash provided by financing activities was million and million in and  respectively  compared to a million use in the net cash provided in was primarily driven by the net proceeds received from our private issuance of long term debt  offset in part by the repurchase of company common stock and repayment of short term debt 
the proceeds from the issuance of the june long term debt were million after discount and expenses 
proceeds from short term borrowings were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
during  million of cash was utilized to repay short term borrowings  compared to repayments of million and million for and  respectively 
we used million  million and million in  and  respectively  for the purchase of company common stock pursuant to the systematic stock repurchase program 
we expect this program to continue in other financing activities primarily relate to share activity under our stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
proceeds from our employee stock plans were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
in  global capital market developments resulted in negative returns on ncr s pension funds and a decline in the discount rate used to estimate the pension liability 
as a result  the accumulated benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of plan assets and ncr was required to adjust the minimum pension liability recorded in the consolidated balance sheet 
this million charge decreased prepaid pension costs by million  increased pension liabilities by million  increased intangible assets by million  increased deferred taxes by million and increased other comprehensive loss by million 
this non cash charge did not affect our earnings  cash flow or debt covenants  nor did it otherwise impact our business operations 
contractual and commercial commitments in the normal course of business  we enter into various contractual and other commercial commitments that impact  or could impact  the liquidity of our operations 
the following table outlines our commitments at december  total less than over amounts year years years years in millions long term debt operating leases non cancelable short term borrowings total contractual unused lines of credit standby letters of credit and surety bonds other corporate guarantees other commitments total commerical  includes unused bank overdraft facilities and other uncommitted funds of million 
we had debt with scheduled maturities of less than one year of million and million at december  and  respectively 
we used a portion of the proceeds from the million senior unsecured notes as described below  issued in june  to repay short term debt 
the weighted average interest rate for such debt was at december  and at december  the increase in the weighted average interest rate reflects a reduced borrowing in japan which has lower rates in versus the prior year 
we had long term debt and notes totaling million and million at december  and  respectively 
material obligations had us dollar equivalent interest rates ranging from to with scheduled maturity dates from to the scheduled maturities of the outstanding long term debt and notes during the next five years are million in  with the remainder after in october  we renewed a million day unsecured credit facility with a one year term out option with a syndicate of financial institutions 
the day facility coincides with a million  five year unsecured revolving credit facility which we entered into in october the credit facilities contain certain representations and warranties  conditions  affirmative  negative and financial covenants  and events of default customary for such facilities 
interest rates charged on borrowings outstanding under the credit facilities are based on prevailing market rates 
no amounts were outstanding under the facilities at december  and in june  we issued million of senior unsecured notes due in the notes were sold privately pursuant to rule a and regulation s of the securities act 
the net proceeds from the notes were used to repay a portion of our short term debt with the remainder available for general corporate purposes 
the notes bear interest at an annual rate of  which increased as of november   and will continue to accrue interest until certain registration requirements are met 
this interest is payable semi annually in arrears on each june and december  beginning december   and contain certain covenants typical of this type of debt instrument 
our cash flows from operations  the credit facilities existing or future arrangements  the senior notes  and other short and long term debt financing  will be sufficient to satisfy our future working capital  r d  capital expenditures and other financing requirements for the foreseeable future 
our ability to generate positive cash flows from operations is dependent on general economic conditions  competitive pressures  and other business and risk factors described below in factors that may affect future results 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations  or otherwise comply with the terms of our credit facilities and the senior notes  we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our existing debt or seek additional financing alternatives 
our current focus on improving free cash flow  which we define as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment  reworkable service parts  and additions to capitalized software  and a continued focus on balance sheet management has increased our ability to generate cash 
during  we generated a million free cash flow improvement over  which was primarily driven by improvement in operating activities and a reduction in capital expenditures 
in millions net cash provided by operating activities less net expenditures and proceeds for service parts expenditures for property  plant and equipment additions to capitalized software free cash flow factors that affect future results this annual report  including the shareholder s letter  and other documents that we file with the securities and exchange commission sec  as well as other oral or written statements we may make from time to time  contain information based on management s beliefs and include forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of that involve a number of known and unknown risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
these forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance  and there are a number of factors including  but not limited to  those listed below  which could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially from the results contemplated by such forward looking statements 
we do not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
economic pressures our business is affected by the global economies in which we operate 
the recent economic downturn and the subsequent decline in capital spending by many industries  particularly retail and telecommunications  could impact our ability to meet our commitments to customers  the ability of our suppliers to meet their commitments to us  the timing of purchases by our current and potential customers  or the ability of our customers to fulfill their obligations to us on a timely basis 
the extent of this impact  if any  is dependent on a number of factors  including the duration and intensity of the downturn  its effect on the markets in general and other general economic and business conditions 
competition our ability to compete effectively within the technology industry is critical to our future success 
we operate in the intensely competitive information technology industry 
this industry is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards  frequent new product introductions  price and cost reductions  and increasingly greater commoditization of products  making differentiation difficult 
our competitors include other large  successful companies in the technology industry such as international business machines corporation ibm  oracle corporation  diebold  inc  dell computer corporation  wincor nixdorf gmbh co  getronics nv and unisys corporation  some of which have widespread penetration of their platforms and service offerings 
in addition  we compete with companies in specific markets such as self check out  electronic shelf labels  entry level atms  payment and imaging  and business consumables and media products 
we offer a broad suite of consulting and support services across our data warehousing  financial self service  retail store automation and payment and imaging segments 
we compete with companies in consulting and support services  and we partner with companies such as cisco systems  dell computer corporation and sun microsystems to deliver it infrastructure services solutions and also offer consulting and support services 
our future competitive performance and market position depend on a number of factors  including our ability to react to competitive product and pricing pressures  penetrate developing and emerging markets such as india and china in the atm business  rapidly and continually design  develop and market  or otherwise maintain and introduce  solutions and related products and services for our customers that are competitive in the marketplace  react on a timely basis to shifts in market demands  reduce costs without creating operating inefficiencies  maintain competitive operating margins  improve product and service delivery quality  and market and sell all of our diverse solutions effectively 
our business and operating performance could be impacted by external competitive pressures  such as increasing price erosion  particularly in the industries targeted by our more mature solution offerings such as retail store automation and financial self service solutions 
in addition  our payment and imaging segment is shifting from traditional item processing as check volume and the traditional item processing markets are declining and financial institutions are migrating to a digital process with the potential to clear checks electronically 
our customers finance many of our product sales through third party financing companies 
in case of customer default  these financing companies may be forced to resell this equipment at discounted prices impacting our ability to sell incremental units 
the impact of these competitive product and pricing pressures could include lower customer satisfaction  decreased demand for our solutions  loss of market share and reduction of operating profits 
operating result fluctuations future operating results could continue to be subject to fluctuations based on a variety of factors  including seasonality our sales are historically seasonal  with revenue higher in the fourth quarter of each year 
during the three quarters ending in march  june and september  we have historically experienced less favorable results than in the quarter ending in december 
such seasonality also causes our working capital and cash flow requirements to vary from quarter to quarter depending on the variability in the volume  timing and mix of product and services sales 
in addition  revenue in the third month of each quarter is typically higher than in the first and second months 
these factors  among others  make forecasting more difficult and may adversely affect our ability to predict financial results accurately 
cost expense reductions we are actively working to manage our costs and expenses to continue improving operating profitability without jeopardizing the quality of our products or the efficiencies of our operations 
we are also striving to become the leading  low cost provider of certain financial self service and retail store automation solutions 
our success in achieving targeted cost and expense reductions depends on a number of factors  including our ability to achieve infrastructure rationalizations  drive lower component costs  improve supply chain efficiencies  improve accounts receivable collections  and reduce inventory overhead  among other things 
if we do not successfully complete our cost reduction initiatives  our results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected 
contractual obligations of consulting services we maintain a professional services consulting workforce to fulfill contracts that we enter into with our customers that may extend to multiple periods 
our profitability may be impacted if we are not able to control costs and maintain utilization rates 
our profitability is largely a function of performing to customer contractual arrangements within the estimated costs to perform these obligations 
if we exceed these estimated costs  our profitability under these contracts may be negatively impacted 
in addition  if we are not able to maintain appropriate utilization rates for our professionals  we may not be able to sustain our profitability 
acquisitions and divestitures as part of our solutions strategy  we intend to continue to selectively acquire and divest technologies  products and businesses 
as these activities take place and we begin to include  or exclude as the case may be  the financial results related to these investments could cause our operating results to fluctuate 
pension funds consistent with local competitive practice and regulations  we sponsor pension plans in many of the countries where we do business 
a number of these pension plans are supported by pension fund investments which are subject to financial market risk 
the liabilities and assets of these plans are reported in our financial statements in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
sfas  employer s accounting for pensions 
in conforming to the requirements of sfas  we are required to make a number of actuarial assumptions for each plan  including expected long term return on plan assets and discount rate 
our future financial results could be materially impacted by changes in these actuarial assumptions  including those described below in our critical accounting policies and estimates 
consistent with the requirements of paragraphs of sfas  we estimate our discount rate and long term expected rate of return on assets assumptions on a country by country basis after consultation with independent actuarial consultants 
we examine interest rate trends within each country  particularly yields on high quality long term corporate bonds  to determine our discount rate assumptions 
our long term expected rate of return on asset assumptions are developed by considering the asset allocation and implementation strategies employed by each pension fund relative to capital market expectations 
real estate our strategy over the past four years with respect to real estate has been to reduce our holdings of excess real estate and to improve liquidity 
in line with this strategy  we anticipate the sale of facilities  which may impact net income 
we will intensify our actions to reduce the size of our real estate portfolio during the upcoming year 
multinational operations generating substantial revenues from our multinational operations helps to balance our risks and meet our strategic goals 
currently  approximately of our revenues come from outside the united states 
we believe that our geographic diversity may help to mitigate some risks associated with geographic concentrations of operations eg adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates  deteriorating economic environments or business disruptions due to economic or political uncertainties  and cultural business practices that may be different from us business practices 
however  our ability to sell our solutions domestically in the united states and internationally is subject to the following risks  among others general economic and political conditions in each country which could adversely affect demand for our solutions in these markets  currency exchange rate fluctuations which could result in lower demand for our products as well as generate currency translation losses  changes to and compliance with a variety of local laws and regulations which may increase our cost of doing business in these markets or otherwise prevent us from effectively competing in these markets  and the impact of civil unrest relating to war and terrorist activity on the economy or markets in general  or on our ability  or that of our suppliers  to meet commitments 
introduction of new solutions the solutions we sell are complex  and we need to rapidly and successfully develop and introduce new solutions 
we operate in a competitive  rapidly changing environment  and our future business and operating results depend in part on our ability to develop and introduce new solutions that our customers choose to buy 
this includes our efforts to rapidly develop and introduce next generation software applications especially for our data warehousing business 
the development process for our complex solutions  including our software application development programs  requires high levels of innovation from both our developers and our suppliers of the components embedded in our solutions 
in addition  the development process can be lengthy and costly  and requires us to commit a significant amount of resources to bring our business solutions to market 
if we are unable to anticipate our customers needs and technological trends accurately  or are otherwise unable to complete development efficiently  we would be unable to introduce new solutions into the market on a timely basis  if at all  and our business and operating results could be impacted 
likewise  we sometimes make commitments to customers regarding new technologies  and our results could be impacted if we are unable to deliver such technologies as planned 
in addition  if we are unable to successfully market and sell both existing and newly developed solutions  such as our advanced function atms  self checkout technologies and electronic shelf labels  and transition our payment and imaging solutions from traditional item processing to imaging  our business and operating results could be impacted 
our solutions  which contain both hardware and software products  may contain known  as well as undetected errors  which may be found after the products introduction and shipment 
while we attempt to remedy errors that we believe would be considered critical by our customers prior to shipment  we may not be able to detect or remedy all such errors  and this could result in lost revenues  delays in customer acceptance and incremental costs  which would all impact our business and operating results 
reliance on third parties third party suppliers provide important elements to our solutions 
we rely on many suppliers for necessary parts and components to complete our solutions 
in most cases  there are a number of vendors producing the parts and components that we utilize 
however  there are some components that are purchased from single sources due to price  quality  technology or other reasons 
for example  we depend on chips and microprocessors from intel corporation and operating systems from unix and microsoft windows nt r 
certain parts and components used in the manufacture of our atms and the delivery of many of our retail store automation solutions are also supplied by single sources 
if we were unable to purchase the necessary parts and components from a particular vendor and we had to find an alternative supplier for such parts and components  our new and existing product shipments and solutions deliveries could be delayed  impacting our business and operating results 
we have  from time to time  formed alliances with third parties that have complementary products  software  services and skills 
many different relationships are formed by these alliances such as outsourcing arrangements to manufacture hardware and subcontract agreements with third parties to perform services and provide products and software to our customers in connection with our solutions 
for example  we rely on third parties for cash replenishment services for our atm products 
these alliances introduce risks that we cannot control such as non performance by third parties and difficulties with or delays in integrating elements provided by third parties into our solutions 
lack of information technology infrastructure  manual processes and data integrity issues of smaller suppliers can also create product time delays  inventory and invoicing problems and staging delays  as well as other operating issues 
the failure of third parties to provide high quality products or services that conform to required specifications or contractual arrangements could impair the delivery of our solutions on a timely basis  create exposure for non compliance with our contractual commitments to our customers and impact our business and operating results 
intellectual property as a technology company  our intellectual property portfolio is key to our future success 
our intellectual property portfolio is a key component of our ability to remain a leading technology and services solutions provider 
to that end  we aggressively protect and work to enhance our proprietary rights in our intellectual property through patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  and if our efforts fail  our business could be impacted 
in addition  many of our offerings rely on technologies developed by others  and if we are not able to continue to obtain licenses for such technologies  our business could be impacted 
there has been a recent increase in the issuance of software and business method patents and more companies are aggressively enforcing their intellectual property rights 
this trend could impact ncr because from time to time we receive notices from third parties regarding patent and other intellectual property claims such as those made by lg electronics lge as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
whether such claims are with or without merit  they may require significant resources to defend 
if an infringement claim is successful  in the event we are unable to license the infringed technology or to substitute similar non infringing technology  our business could be adversely affected 
work environment restructuring as we discussed above  we are implementing a re engineering plan to drive operational efficiency throughout our company 
in order to drive cost and expense out of our businesses  we are rationalizing our infrastructure through real estate and support cost reductions  simplifying our front and back office processes by  for example  standardizing global it applications and finance and administration processes  reducing our product costs through design and procurement initiatives  and working to lower our cost of services through completion of a global model for such services 
in addition to reducing costs and expenses  our plan includes initiatives to grow revenue such as improving sales training  addressing sales territory requirements and focusing on our strong value propositions 
if we are not successful in managing the required changes to implement this plan  in particular those related to changing our internal processes  our business and operating results could be impacted 
employees our employees are vital to our success 
our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical  sales  consulting and other key personnel is critical  as these key employees are difficult to replace and our current re engineering efforts may adversely impact our workforce 
if we are not able to attract or retain highly qualified employees by offering competitive compensation  secure work environments and leadership opportunities now and in the future  our business and operating results could be impacted 
internal controls accounting policies and practices our internal controls  accounting policies and practices  and internal information systems enable us to capture and process transactions in a timely and accurate manner in compliance with gaap  laws and regulations  taxation requirements and federal securities laws and regulations 
while we believe these controls  policies  practices and systems are adequate to ensure data integrity  unanticipated and unauthorized actions of employees both domestic and international or temporary lapses in internal controls due to resource constraints could lead to improprieties that could impact our financial condition or results of operations 
information systems it is periodically necessary to replace  upgrade or modify our internal information systems 
if we are unable to replace  upgrade or modify such systems in a timely and cost effective manner  especially in light of strains on our information technology resources  our ability to capture and process financial transactions and therefore our financial condition or results of operation may be impacted 
acquisitions and alliances our ability to successfully integrate acquisitions or effectively manage alliance activities will help drive future growth 
as part of our overall solutions strategy  we intend to continue making investments in companies  products  services and technologies  either through acquisitions  joint ventures or strategic alliances 
acquisitions and alliance activities inherently involve risks 
the risks we may encounter include those associated with assimilating and integrating different business operations and control procedures  corporate cultures  personnel  infrastructures and technologies or products acquired or licensed  retaining key employees and the potential for unknown liabilities within the acquired or combined business 
the investment or alliance may also disrupt our ongoing business  or we may not be able to successfully incorporate acquired products  services or technologies into our solutions and maintain quality 
further  we may not achieve the projected synergies once we have integrated the business into our operations 
it is our policy not to discuss or comment upon negotiations regarding such business combinations or divestitures unless they are material and a definitive agreement is signed or circumstances indicate a high degree of probability that a material transaction will be consummated  unless the law requires otherwise 
environmental our historical and ongoing manufacturing activities subject us to environmental exposures 
our facilities and operations are subject to a wide range of environmental protection laws  and we have investigatory and remedial activities underway at a number of facilities that we currently own or operate  or formerly owned or operated  to comply  or to determine compliance  with such laws 
given the uncertainties inherent in such activities  there can be no assurances that the costs required to comply with applicable environmental laws will not impact future operating results 
we have also been identified as a potentially responsible party in connection with certain environmental matters  including the fox river matter  as further described in environmental matters under note of notes to consolidated financial statements and in the critical accounting policies and estimates section of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and we incorporate such disclosures by reference and make them a part of this risk factor 
as described in more detail in such disclosures  we maintain an accrual for our potential liability on the fox river matter which represents certain critical estimates and judgments made by us regarding our potential liability  however  both the ultimate costs associated with the fox river site and our share of those costs are subject to a wide range of potential outcomes 
contingencies like other technology companies  we face uncertainties with regard to regulations  lawsuits and other related matters 
in the normal course of business  we are subject to proceedings  lawsuits  claims and other matters  including those that relate to the environment  health and safety  employee benefits  export compliance  intellectual property and other regulatory compliance and general matters 
because such matters are subject to many uncertainties  their outcomes are not predictable 
while we believe that amounts provided in our consolidated financial statements are currently adequate in light of the probable and estimable liabilities  there can be no assurances that the amounts required to satisfy alleged liabilities from such matters will not impact future operating results 
additionally  we are subject to diverse and complex laws and regulations  including those relating to corporate governance  public disclosure and reporting  which are rapidly changing and subject to many possible changes in the future 
although we do not believe that recent regulatory and legal initiatives will result in significant changes to our internal practices or our operations  rapid changes in accounting standards  taxation requirements including tax rate changes  new tax laws and revised tax interpretations  and federal securities laws and regulations  among others  may substantially increase costs to our organization and could impact our future operating results 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap 
in connection with the preparation of these financial statements  we are required to make assumptions  estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and the related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
these assumptions  estimates and judgments are based on historical experience and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable at the time 
however  because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
our critical accounting policies are those which require assumptions to be made about matters that are highly uncertain 
different estimates could have a material impact on our financial results 
judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies and estimates may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or circumstances 
our management continually reviews these estimates and assumptions to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and are materially correct 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap and does not require significant management judgment in its application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result 
the significant accounting policies and estimates that we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results are discussed in the paragraphs below 
our senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with our independent auditors and the audit committee of our board of directors see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  which contains additional information regarding our accounting policies and other disclosures required by gaap 
revenue recognition we are a solutions company which provides our customers with computer hardware  software  professional consulting services and customer support services 
consistent with other companies that provide similar solution offerings  revenue recognition is often complex and subject to multiple accounting pronouncements including staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  statement of position no 
sop  software revenue recognition  and related interpretations 
in general  we consider revenue realized  or realizable  and earned when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the products or services have been provided to the customer  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
this policy is consistently applied to all of our operating segments 
hardware and software revenue is recognized upon shipment  delivery  installation or customer acceptance of the product  as defined in the customer contract 
generally  we do not sell our software products without the related hardware as our software products are embedded in the hardware we sell 
our typical solution requires no significant production  modification or customization of the software or hardware that is essential to the functionality of the products other than installation for our more complex solutions 
for these complex solutions  revenue is deferred until all customer contractual obligations have been met 
our sales arrangements often include support services in addition to hardware and software 
these services could include hardware and software maintenance  upgrade rights  customer support and professional consulting services 
for sales arrangements that include bundled hardware  software and services  we account for any undelivered service offering as a separate element of a multiple element arrangement 
these services are typically not required to operate the hardware and software 
revenue deferred for services is determined based upon vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of the elements as prescribed in sop for these services  revenue is typically recognized ratably over the period benefited or when the services are complete 
if the services are essential to the functionality of the hardware and software  revenue from the hardware and software components is deferred until the essential services are complete 
revenue recognition for complex contractual arrangements require a greater degree of judgment  including a review of specific contracts  past experience  credit worthiness of customers  international laws and other factors 
changes in judgments about these factors could impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized between periods 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a number of factors 
we establish provisions for doubtful accounts using percentages of our accounts receivable balances as an overall proxy to reflect historical average credit losses and provision for known issues 
these percentages are applied to aged accounts receivable balances 
aged accounts are determined based on the number of days the receivable is outstanding  measured from the date of the invoice  or from the date on which payment is due 
as the age of the receivable increases  the provision percentage also increases 
this policy is applied to all of our operating segments 
based on the factors below  we periodically review customer account activity in order to assess the adequacy of the allowances provided for potential losses 
factors considered include economic conditions and each customer s payment history and credit worthiness 
judgment is used to assess the collectibility of account balances  and the credit worthiness of a customer 
the allowance for doubtful accounts for the periods ended december was million in  million in and million in these allowances represent  and of gross receivables for  and  respectively 
the increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts between and represents a million provision for uncollectible loans and receivables related to ccc 
although no near term changes are expected  unforeseen changes to future allowance percentages could materially impact overall financial results 
given our experience  we believe that the reserves for potential losses are adequate  but if one or more of our larger customers were to default on its obligations  we could be exposed to potentially significant losses in excess of the provisions established 
if economic conditions worsen  impacting our customers ability to pay  we may increase our reserves for doubtful accounts 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at lower of cost or market 
each quarter  our business segments reassess raw materials  work in process  parts and finished equipment inventory average costs for purchase or usage variances from standards and valuation adjustments are made 
additionally  to properly provide for potential exposure due to slow moving  excess  obsolete or unusable inventory  a reserve against inventory is established 
this reserve is established based on forecasted usage  orders  technological obsolescence and inventory aging 
these factors are impacted by market conditions  technology changes  and changes in strategic direction  and require estimates and management judgment that may include elements that are uncertain 
on a quarterly basis  we review the current market value of inventory and require each business segment to ensure that inventory balances are adjusted for any inventory exposure due to age or excess of cost over market value 
we have inventory in more than countries around the world 
we transfer inventory from our plants to our distribution and sales organizations 
this inventory is transferred at cost plus mark up 
this mark up is referred to as inter company profit 
each quarter we review our inventory levels and analyze our inter company profit for each of our segments to determine the amount of inter company profit to eliminate 
key assumptions are made to estimate product gross margins  the product mix of existing inventory balances and current period shipments 
over time  we refine these estimates as facts and circumstances allow 
if our estimates require refinement our results could be impacted 
our inventory reserve balances of million  million and million as of december   and represent  and of our gross inventory balances for each period 
although we strive to achieve a balance between market demands and risk of inventory excess or obsolescence caused by these factors  it is possible that  should conditions change  additional reserves may be needed 
any changes in reserves will impact operating income during a given period 
this policy is consistently applied to all of our operating segments and we do not anticipate any changes to our policy in the near term 
warranty reserves one of our key strategies is to provide superior quality products and services 
to that end  we provide a standard manufacturer s warranty extending up to months such that  should products under warranty require repair  no additional cost of that repair will be charged to our customers 
a corresponding estimated liability for potential warranty costs is also recorded at the time of the sale 
we sometimes offer extended warranties to our customers for purchase 
we defer the fair value of these revenues and recognize revenue over the life of the warranty 
this impacts all segments of our business except for the other segment where minimal warranty  if any  is offered 
future warranty obligation costs are based upon historic factors such as labor rates  average repair time  travel time  number of service calls per machine and cost of replacement parts 
each segment consummating a sale recognizes the total customer revenue and records the associated warranty liability based upon the pre established warranty percentages for that product class 
total warranty costs for the period ended december  were million  million in and million in  representing  and of total product revenues in the respective periods 
historically the principal factor used to estimate our warranty costs has been service calls per machine 
significant changes in this factor could result in actual warranty costs differing from accrued estimates 
although no near term changes in our estimated warranty reserves are currently anticipated  in the unlikely event of a significant increase in warranty claims by one or more of our larger customers  costs to fulfill warranty obligations would be higher than provisioned  thereby impacting results 
pension  postretirement and postemployment benefits we account for defined benefit pension plans in accordance with sfas which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
our postretirement plans are accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  and our postemployment plans are accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  employers accounting for postemployment benefits 
we have significant pension  postretirement and postemployment benefit costs and credits  which are developed from actuarial valuations 
actuarial assumptions attempt to anticipate future events and are used in calculating the expense and liability relating to these plans 
these factors include assumptions we make about interest rates  expected investment return on plan assets  rate of increase in health care costs  total and involuntary turnover rates  and rates of future compensation increases 
in addition  our actuarial consultants also use subjective factors such as withdrawal rates and mortality rates to develop our valuations 
we generally review and update these assumptions on an annual basis at the beginning of each fiscal year 
we are required to consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates  in making these assumptions 
the actuarial assumptions that we use may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension  postretirement or postemployment benefits expense we have recorded or may record 
postretirement and postemployment expenses impact all of our segments  while pension income is reported at the corporate level 
the key assumptions used in developing our pension and postretirement plan expense were the discount rate of and expected return on assets assumption of for our us plans which represents and of pension and postretirement plan obligations  respectively 
holding all other assumptions constant  a change in the discount rate used for the us plan would have increased or decreased pre tax income by approximately million 
likewise  a change in the expected rate of return on plan assets assumption would have increased or decreased pre tax income by approximately million 
our expected return on plan assets has historically been and will likely continue to be material to operating and net income 
while it is required that we review our actuarial assumptions each year at the measurement date  we generally do not change them between measurement dates 
we use a measurement date of december  for all of our plans 
in determining pension and postretirement expense for the us plans  we intend to use a discount rate of and an expected rate of return on assets assumption of 
the most significant assumption used in developing our postemployment plan expense was the assumed rate of involuntary turnover of 
the involuntary turnover rate is based on historical trends and projections of involuntary turnover in the future 
our historical assumption has been  however  due to reengineering activities that increased our recent involuntary turnover rate and our projection of involuntary turnover  we raised our rate to 
a change in the rate of involuntary turnover would have increased or decreased pre tax expense by approximately million 
environmental and legal contingencies each quarter  we review the status of each claim and legal proceeding and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for contingencies 
to the extent the amount of a probable loss is estimable only by reference to a range of equally probable outcomes  and no amount within the range appears to be a better estimate than any other amount  we accrue for the low end of the range 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  the use of estimates  assumptions  judgments and external factors beyond our control  accruals are based on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates 
such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
when insurance carriers or third parties have agreed to pay any amounts related to costs  and we believe that it is probable that we can collect such amounts  those amounts would be reflected as receivables in our consolidated financial statements 
the most significant legal contingency impacting our company relates to the fox river matter  which is further described in detail in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
this matter impacts our company overall and does not affect the financial results of any one of its segments 
as described in note  ncr was identified as a potentially responsible party prp at the fox river site in wisconsin  because of polychlorinated biphenyl pcb discharges from two carbonless paper manufacturing facilities previously owned by ncr located along the fox river 
some parties contend that ncr is also responsible for pcb discharges from paper mills owned by other companies because carbonless paper manufactured by ncr was purchased by those mills as a raw material for their paper making processes 
ncr sold the facilities in to the present owner  appleton papers inc api  which has also been identified as a prp 
the other fox river prps include ph glatfelter company  georgia pacific formerly fort james  wtm co 
formerly wisconsin tissue  now owned by chesapeake corporation  riverside paper corporation  and us paper mills corp 
owned by sonoco products company 
as of the end of  our reserve for the fox river matter was approximately million 
in  we increased our reserve to account for the government s proposed clean up plan  which included certain estimates regarding the total clean up costs associated with the fox river  among other things 
we regularly re evaluate the assumptions we use in determining the appropriate reserve for the fox river matter as additional information becomes available and  when warranted  make appropriate adjustments 
the extent of our potential liability has been highly uncertain and continues to be so at this time 
our eventual liability which we expect will be paid out over the next or more years will depend on a number of factors 
in general  these factors include the total clean up costs for the site  the total natural resource damages for the site  the share ncr and api will jointly bear of the total clean up costs and natural resource damages  as former and current owners of paper manufacturing facilities along the fox river the share ncr will bear of the joint ncr api payments for clean up costs and natural resource damages  and our transaction costs to defend our company in this matter 
in setting our reserve  we have attempted to estimate a range of reasonably possible outcomes for each of these factors  although each range is itself highly uncertain 
we use our best estimate within the range if that is possible 
where there is a range of equally probable outcomes  and there is no amount within that range that appears to be a better estimate than any other amount  we use the low end of the range 
each of these factors is discussed below 
for the first factor described above  total clean up costs for the site  we determined that there is a range of equally probable outcomes  and that no estimate within that range was better than the other estimates 
accordingly  we used the low end of that range  which was the government s estimate of the clean up costs as set forth in the proposed clean up plan 
this amount was million  however there can be no assurances that this amount will not be significantly higher 
for example  one consultant has expressed an opinion that total clean up costs for the site could be approximately billion 
in relying on the government estimates for clean up costs  we assumed that neither the amount of dredging undertaken nor the cost per cubic yard of the dredging will vary significantly from the amounts contained in the proposed plan 
the goverment s final clean up plan for the first two areas of the fox river that was released in january is generally consistent with the estimates for the corresponding portions of its proposed plan 

second  for total natural resource damages  we also determined that there is a range of equally probable outcomes  and that no estimate within that range was better than the other estimates 
accordingly  we used the low end of that range  which was the lowest estimate in a government report on natural resource damages 
this amount was million 

third  for the ncr api share of clean up costs and natural resource damages  we examined figures developed by several independent  nationally recognized engineering and paper industry experts  along with those set forth in draft government reports 
again  we determined that there is a range of equally probable outcomes  and that no estimate within that range was better than the other estimates 
accordingly  we used the low end of that range  which was primarily an estimate of the joint ncr api percentage of direct discharges of pcbs to the river 

fourth  for our share of the joint ncr api payments  we estimated we would pay approximately half of the total costs jointly attributable to ncr api 
this is based on a sharing agreement between us and api  the terms of which are confidential 
this factor assumes that api is able to pay its share of the ncr api joint share 

finally  for our transaction costs to defend this matter  we estimated the costs we are likely to incur over the four year period covered by the ncr api interim settlement with the government which is described below 
this estimate is based on our costs since this matter first arose in and estimates of what our defense costs will be in the future 
we do not expect there to be any significant near term changes to any of the above described assumptions that are likely to have a material effect on the amount of our accrual 
however  there are other estimates for each of these factors which are significantly higher than the estimates described above 
we believe there is such uncertainty surrounding these estimates that we cannot quantify the high end of the range of such estimates 
in any event  assuming  for example  that the above described assumptions are each doubled  our payments for the potential liabilities for the fox river matter would be approximately million to be paid out over the next or more years 
at t corp 
and lucent technologies  inc are jointly responsible for indemnifying us for a portion of amounts incurred by our company over a certain threshold  and the million estimate assumes they will make such payments 
if we were in fact required to pay an amount such as million for ncr s share of the fox river liabilities  it would have a minimal impact on our liquidity and capital resources  assuming that such amount was required to be paid over the time frame currently contemplated 
however  if such an amount were required to be paid in a shorter time period  it could have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources 
we have discussed above our overall  long term exposure to the fox river liability 
however  as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  we also have limited short term liability for this matter 
in december  ncr and api entered into an interim settlement with the governmental agencies that limits ncr api s joint cash payouts to million per year over a four year period beginning at the time of such interim settlement 
any portion of an annual million installment not paid out in a given year will be rolled over and made available for payment during subsequent years up until december  these payments are being shared by us and api under the terms of the confidential settlement agreement discussed above and will be credited against our long term exposure for this matter 
investment in marketable securities we typically classify our marketable securities as available for sale and account for them at fair value with net unrealized gains or losses reported  net of tax  within stockholders equity 
if a decline in the fair value of a marketable security is deemed by us to be other than temporary  the cost basis of the investment is written down to estimated fair value  and the amount of the write down is included in the determination of income 
the determination of whether a decline in the fair market value is to be other than temporary requires a significant amount of judgment and is based on historical experience and upon information available to us at the time 
however  because future events relating to marketable securities cannot be determined with absolute certainty  our decision to recognize a loss may be premature or we may fail to a make a timely adjustment  impacting future earnings 
during the fourth quarter of  we recognized a pre tax loss of million for investments in marketable securities in japan 
currently  we do not anticipate any near term changes in the fair market value of our marketable securities and any changes in the fair market value would be immaterial 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for income taxes  which recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
the deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the enacted tax rates expected to apply in the periods in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be settled or realized 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the determination as to whether a deferred tax asset will be realized is made on a jurisdictional basis and is based on the evaluation of positive and negative evidence 
this evidence includes historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversal of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
projected future taxable income is based on our expected results and assumptions as to which jurisdiction the income will be earned 
the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences is based on current tax law and our tax methods of accounting 
we also review our liabilities under sfas no 
which requires an accrual for estimated losses when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
these projections and estimates may change in the future as actual results become known 
if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income  or if there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates or the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible  or if the tax laws change unfavorably  then we could be required to increase our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  resulting in an increase in our effective tax rate 
the impact to our effective tax rate would be an increase of one percentage point for each increase of million to the valuation allowance as of december  we have a valuation allowance of million as of december  related to certain deferred income tax assets  primarily tax loss carryforwards  in jurisdictions where there is uncertainty as to ultimate realization of a benefit from those tax assets

impairment of long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  long lived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
when required  impairment losses on assets to be held and used are recognized based on the fair value of the asset 
we determine the fair value of these assets based upon estimates of future cash flows  market value of similar assets  if available  or independent appraisals  if required 
in analyzing the fair value and recoverability using future cash flows  we make projections based on a number of assumptions and estimates of growth rates  future economic conditions  assignment of discount rates and estimates of terminal values 
an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the long lived asset is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows 
the measurement of impairment loss is the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset 
this policy is applied to all of our segments 
long lived assets to be disposed of and or held for sale are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
we determine the fair value of these assets in the same manner as described for assets held and used 
the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  business combinations and sfas in june sfas specifies criteria that intangible assets acquired in a purchase method business combination must be recognized and reported apart from goodwill 
sfas requires that goodwill no longer be amortized  but instead be tested for impairment at least annually 
sfas also requires intangible assets with definite useful lives to continue to be amortized over their respective useful lives and be tested for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
indefinite life intangible assets must be tested annually to determine whether events or circumstances continue to support the indefinite useful life 
if the intangible asset is subsequently determined to have a finite useful life  the asset shall be tested for impairment in accordance with sfas similar to goodwill  the assessment of impairment for intangible assets requires estimates of future cash flows 
to the extent the carrying value of the assets exceed their fair value  an impairment loss would be recorded 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for our disclosure regarding intangible assets and goodwill 
recently issued accounting pronouncements a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements is described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements and we incorporate such discussion in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations by reference and make it a part hereof 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
we use a variety of measures to monitor and manage these risks  including derivative financial instruments 
since a substantial portion of our operations and revenue occur outside the united states  and in currencies other than the us dollar  our results can be significantly impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
to manage our exposures and mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on the operations of our foreign subsidiaries  we hedge our main transactional exposures through the use of foreign exchange forward contracts and options 
this is primarily done through the hedging of foreign currency denominated inter company inventory purchases by the marketing units and of foreign currency denominated inventory sales by the manufacturing units  and of certain financing transactions that are firmly committed or forecasted 
these foreign exchange contracts are designated as cash flow hedges  and the gains or losses are deferred in other comprehensive income and recognized in the determination of income when the underlying hedged transaction impacts earnings 
as we hedge inventory purchases  the ultimate gain or loss from the derivative contract is recorded in cost of sales when the inventory is sold to an unrelated third party 
our strategy is to hedge  on behalf of each subsidiary  our non functional currency denominated cash flows for a period of up to months 
in this way  much of the impact of currency fluctuations on non functional currency denominated transactions and hence on subsidiary operating income as stated in the functional currency is mitigated in the near term 
in the longer term longer than the hedging period of up to months the subsidiaries are still subject to the impacts of foreign currency fluctuations 
in addition  the subsidiary results are still subject to any impact of translating the functional currency results to us dollars 
when hedging certain foreign currency transactions of a long term investment nature net investments in foreign operations  gains and losses are recorded in the currency translation adjustment component of stockholders equity 
gains and losses on other foreign exchange contracts are recognized in other income or expense as exchange rates change 
for purposes of potential risk analysis  we use sensitivity analysis to quantify potential impacts that market rate changes may have on the fair values of our hedge portfolio related to firmly committed or forecasted transactions 
the sensitivity analysis represents the hypothetical changes in value of the hedge position and does not reflect the related gain or loss on the forecasted underlying transaction 
a appreciation in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies from the prevailing market rates would result in a million increase or a million increase in the fair value of the hedge portfolio as of december  and  respectively 
conversely  a depreciation of the us dollar against foreign currencies from the prevailing market rates would result in a million decrease or a million decrease in the fair value of the hedge portfolio as of december  and  respectively 
the interest rate risk associated with our borrowing and investing activities at december   was not material in relation to our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
historically  we have not used derivative financial instruments to alter the interest rate characteristics of our investment holdings or debt instruments but could do so in the future 
we utilize non exchange traded financial instruments such as foreign exchange forward contracts and options that we purchase exclusively from highly rated financial institutions 
additionally  we utilize put option contracts that are not exchange traded as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
with respect to foreign exchange contracts  we record these on our balance sheet at fair market value based upon market price quotations from the financial institutions 
we do not enter into non exchange traded contracts that require the use of fair value estimation techniques  but if we did  they could have a material impact on our financial results 
also  we do not enter into hedges for speculative purposes 
we are potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk on accounts receivable and financial instruments such as hedging instruments  short term investments  and cash and cash equivalents 
credit risk includes the risk of nonperformance by counterparties 
the maximum potential loss may exceed the amount recognized on the balance sheet 
exposure to credit risk is managed through credit approvals  credit limits  selecting major international financial institutions as counterparties to hedging transactions and monitoring procedures 
our business often involves large transactions with customers for which we do not require collateral  and if one or more of those customers were to default on its obligations under applicable contractual arrangements  we could be exposed to potentially significant losses 
moreover  the continued downturn in the global economy could have an adverse impact on the ability of our customers to pay their obligations on a timely basis 
however  we believe that the reserves for potential losses are adequate 
at december  and  we did not have any major concentration of credit risk related to financial instruments
