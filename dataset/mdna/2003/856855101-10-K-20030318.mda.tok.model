all significant accounting policies are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this discussion  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the consolidated financial statements and how those values are determined

balance sheet analysis the composition of assets and liabilities are generally the result of management decisions influenced by market forces 
the company reported total assets at december  of billion and billion at december  lending activities the company s largest asset category continues to be loans 
the company s gross loans  as a percentage of total deposits  were at december  compared to at december  the following table shows the company s loan portfolio composition on the dates indicated dollars in thousands 
at december  of of of of of total total total total total commercial      commercial real estate      real estate mortgage      installment      other      total loans      total loans outstanding decreased million in  due to the conversion of approximately million of long term fixed rate mortgages into a mortgage backed security during the first quarter of the decrease from the conversion was substantially offset by increased loan growth  mainly in the commercial real estate category 
total loans outstanding increased million in mainly due to the acquisition of liberty bank 
the company continues to emphasize commercial and commercial real estate lending 
commercial loans increased million in commercial loans increased million in due to the liberty acquisition and internal loan growth 
commercial loans are underwritten according to the company s loan policy  which sets forth the amount of credit which can be extended based upon the borrower s cash flow  debt service capacity  leverage and discounted collateral value 
commercial loans are typically made on the basis of the borrower s ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the business 
in recognition of specific borrower risk  as well as inherent risk due to the general economic environment  the company emphasizes capacity to repay the loan  adequacy of the borrower s capital  an evaluation of the industry conditions affecting the borrower  and current credit file documentation 
the company s commercial loans are typically secured by the borrower s business assets such as  inventory  accounts receivable  fixtures  and equipment 
generally  commercial loans carry the personal guarantees of the principals

loans for construction and land development are generally secured by the property under construction or development up to a maximum loan to value of of estimated cost or appraisal value of the completed project  whichever is less 
the company further monitors construction and land development credits by disbursing draws under the credit commitment upon satisfactory title company inspections of construction progress and evidence of proper lien waivers 
the borrower s creditworthiness and the economic feasibility and cash flow abilities of the project are fundamental concerns in the company s commercial real estate and construction land development lending 
loans secured by commercial property  whether existing or under construction  and land development are generally larger in size and involve greater risks than residential mortgage loans because payments on loans secured by commercial property are dependent upon the successful operation and management of these properties  businesses  or developments 
as a result  the value of properties securing such loans are likely to be subject to the local real estate market and general economic conditions  including movements in interest rates 
the company generally writes commercial real estate loans for maturities up to five years although the total amortization period may be as long as twenty five years  amortized monthly 
the company generally writes construction and land development loans on terms up to a maximum of months and requires the borrower to make defined principal reductions at stated intervals during that term 
the company additionally attempts to have construction credits further supported by end mortgage commitments  wherever possible 
the company will generally make credit extensions for land development projects to experienced  strong borrowers with adequate outside liquidity to support the project in the event the actual project performance is slower than projection 
the company s real estate loans  like all of the company s loans  are underwritten according to its written loan policy 
the loan policy sets forth the term  debt service capacity  credit extension  and loan to value guidelines  which the company considers acceptable to recognize the level of risk associated with each specific loan category 
the following table sets forth the percentage composition of the real estate loan portfolio as of december  commercial real estate family first liens on residential real estate multifamily residential family junior liens on residential real estate including home equity lines of credit construction  land development  and farmland installment loans decreased million during due to strong refinance activity in a low rate environment  primarily into real estate mortgages 
competition from the captive auto manufacturers finance affiliates has also been strong 
installment loans increased million during due to the liberty acquisition 
the company cultivates installment loans primarily through the purchase of loan contracts from its network of auto dealers developed over the years 
the company continues to pursue additional auto dealer contacts to build this network of loan referrals 
the company s indirect auto loan underwriting emphasizes the purchase of the highest quality loan contracts to minimize risk of loss in this lending activity 
other loans decreased thousand in other loans decreased million in due to decreases in municipal loans and overdrafts 
the following table shows the maturity of loans excluding residential mortgages on one to four family residences  and installment loans outstanding as of december  dollars in thousands and the amounts due after one year classified according to the sensitivity to changes in interest rates after one within but within after one year five years five years total commercial     real estate mortgage     loans maturing after one year with fixed interest rates   variable interest rates  total   risk elements in the loan portfolio certain risks are inherent in the lending function including a borrower s subsequent inability to pay  insufficient collateral coverage  and changes in interest rates 
the company attempts to reduce these risks by adherence to a written set of loan policies and procedures 
included in these policies and procedures are underwriting practices covering debt service coverage  loan to value ratios  and loan term 
evidence of a specific repayment source is required on each credit extension  with documentation of the borrower s repayment capacity 
generally  this repayment source is the borrower s cash flow  which must demonstrate the ability to service the debt based upon historical results and projections of future performance 
management maintains the allowance for loan and lease losses the allowance at a level considered adequate to provide for estimable and probable loan losses 
the allowance is increased by provisions charged to earnings  and is reduced by charge offs  net of recoveries 
at december   the allowance was million and million at december  the determination of allowance adequacy is based upon on going evaluations of the company s loan portfolio conducted by the internal loan review function of the bank and reviewed by management 
these evaluations consider a variety of factors  including  but not limited to  general economic conditions  loan portfolio size and composition  previous loss experience  the borrowers financial condition  collateral adequacy  and the level of non performing loans 
as a percentage of total loans outstanding  the allowance increased to at the end of compared to at the end of because of the downturn in the national economy and the change in the composition of the company s loan portfolio  management made the decision to increase the allowance 
based on its analyses  management considers the allowance adequate to recognize the risk inherent in the consolidated loan portfolio at december  the balance of the allowance and actual loan loss experience for the last five years is summarized in the following table dollars in thousands years ended december  balance at beginning of period      charge offs commercial   real estate mortgage installment other total charge offs    recoveries commercial real estate mortgage installment other total recoveries net charge offs   balance of acquired allowances at date of acquisitions  additions charged to operations   balance at end of period      ratios net charge offs to average loans outstanding net charge offs to total allowance allowance to year end loans outstanding when  in the opinion of management  serious doubt exists as to the collectibility of a loan  the loan is placed on nonaccrual status 
at the time a loan is classified as nonaccrual  interest credited to income in the current year is reversed and interest income accrued in the prior year is charged to the allowance 
the company generally does not recognize income on loans past due days or more

fasb defines a loan as impaired if  based on current information or events  it is probable that a creditor will not be able to collect all amounts both contractual principal and interest due in accordance with the terms of the original loan agreement 
at december   the company identified approximately million in loans considered impaired pursuant to this definition 
these loans are included as part of the nonaccrual loans set forth in the table above 
based upon the analyses of the underlying collateral value of these loans and the low percentage of these loans in relation to the gross loan portfolio  management believes the allowance is adequate to provide for the inherent risk associated with these loans 
at december   there were no additional loans to borrowers where available information would indicate that such loans were likely to later be included as nonaccrual  impaired as defined in fasb statement no 
 past due  or restructured 
investment activities investment securities that the company has both the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost 
investment securities that the company does not have either the positive intent and or the ability to hold to maturity and all marketable equity securities are classified as available for sale and carried at their respective fair market values 
unrealized holding gains and losses on securities classified as available for sale  net of related tax effects  are carried as a component of shareholders equity 
the company has no assets classified as trading

total investment securities outstanding at december  increased million mainly due to the company leveraging its capital position by entering into approximately million in leverage transactions 
additionally  the company securitized approximately million of fixed rate mortgage loans and retained the resulting investments created from the securitization 
offsetting the aforementioned increases were approximately million in prepayments from mortgage related securities resulting from the accelerated mortgage refinancing activity and bullet maturities that were not reinvested during the following table presents the combined carrying values of the company s held to maturity and available for sale investment securities on the dates indicated dollars in thousands

all leverage transactions were structured to match fund the investment purchase with a borrowing either repurchase agreements or fhlb borrowings of comparable maturity  duration  or term to interest repricing 
the resulting spread from each transaction the difference between the acquired asset and the related funding vehicle was targeted to provide basis points at a minimum 
the investments purchased were a combination of million of mortgage related securities  million of us government agencies  million of investment grade corporate notes  and million of investment grade floating rate trust preferred securities 
funding consisted of million of repurchase agreements  million of fhlb borrowings  and million from other sources 
in the aggregate  the company s spread on leverage transactions entered into during was basis points at december  balances in mortgage related securities increased million in due to the conversion of approximately million in fixed rate mortgage loans in march and retaining the assets in the form of the resulting investment securities 
the company entered into this transaction to enhance the liquidity of the underlying mortgages to fund future loan portfolio growth 
in addition  the company acquired approximately million in mortgage related securities in a leverage transaction match funded with repurchase agreements of comparable duration at a basis point spread 
offsetting these increases were approximately million in accelerated prepayments  impacted by the continued exceptionally high level of mortgage refinancing that occurred as a result of continued declines in long term interest rates during the year

unrealized gains and losses resulting from marketable equity securities are impacted by the current market price quoted for the underlying security in relation to the price at which the security was acquired by the company 
unrealized gains and losses on investment securities are the result of changes in market interest rates and the relationship of the company s investments to those rates for comparable maturities 
unrealized gains generally result from the interest rates on the company s portfolio of investment securities exceeding market rates for comparable maturities 
conversely  unrealized losses generally result from the interest rates on the company s portfolio of investment securities falling below market rates for comparable maturities 
if material  unrealized losses could negatively impact the company s future performance as earnings from these investments would be less than alternative investments currently available and may not provide as wide a spread between earnings and funding costs

liquid assets in excess of necessary cash reserves are generally invested in short term investments such as federal funds sold  commercial paper  and interest earning deposits 
interest rate sensitivity interest rate risk is an inherent part of the banking business as financial institutions gather deposits and borrow funds to finance interest earning assets 
interest rate risk results when repricing of rates paid on deposits and other borrowing does not coincide with the repricing of interest earning assets 
interest rate sensitivity management seeks to avoid fluctuating net interest margins and to enhance consistent growth of net interest income through periods of changing interest rates 
the following table shows the estimated maturity and repricing structure of the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities for three different independent and cumulative time intervals as of december  dollars in millions 
for purposes of presentation in the following table  the company used the national deposit decay rate assumptions published by the office of the comptroller of the currency as of december   which  for now accounts  money market accounts  and savings deposits in the one year or less category were   and  respectively 
the table does not necessarily indicate the impact general interest rate movements may have on the company s net interest income as the actual repricing experience of certain assets and liabilities  such as loan prepayments and deposit withdrawals  is beyond the company s control 
as a result  certain assets and liabilities may reprice at intervals different from the maturities assumed in the following table given the general movement in interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates

variable rate and maturing fixed rate loans are the primary interest sensitive assets repricing within one year 
time deposits are the most significant liabilities subject to repricing within one year on the funding side of the balance sheet 
at december   the company reported a positive cumulative one year gap of compared to a negative cumulative one year gap of at december  the company s transition to a positive cumulative one year gap at december  was mainly due to an increase in the amount of variable rate loans outstanding and a reduction in time deposits with a maturity of one year or less 
the company s asset sensitivity at december  would normally indicate that the company s net interest margin would improve if rates increased and deteriorate if interest rates decreased 
capital resources total shareholders equity was million  million  and million at december    and  respectively 
during  the company repurchased thousand shares of its common stock in the open market at an average price of in open market purchases 
additionally  in december  the company completed its dutch auction tender offer  purchasing and retiring thousand shares at per share 
as a result of stock repurchase activity  total shareholders equity decreased million in offsetting this decline in were net retained earnings and tax effected unrealized gains in the company s investment portfolio 
the equity decreases in and were primarily due to the company s stock repurchase program under which the company repurchased approximately thousand shares of common stock at a average price of per share in  and thousand shares at a average price of per share in total dividends declared were million in  million in  and million in the company maintained a cash dividend declared amount of

the total dollar decreases in each year are the direct result of the stock repurchase program 
total assets increased in in comparison to primarily due to the company leveraging its balance sheet 
total assets increased in in comparison to primarily due to the acquisition of lb bancorp  inc acquisitions and asset growth  coupled with the company s stock repurchase program and dutch auction tender offer  impacted the average equity to asset ratios of   and in the years   and  respectively 
there are certain regulatory constraints which affect the company s capital levels 
at december   the company s actual regulatory amounts and ratios exceeded those necessary to be defined as well capitalized under regulatory framework 
see note and note to the consolidated financial statements for additional explanation of these regulatory constraints 
impact of inflation and changing prices the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration of changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time impacted by inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the company s other expenses which tend to rise during periods of general inflation 
the majority of the company s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature and therefore differ greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in fixed assets or inventories 
consequently  interest rates have a greater impact on the company s performance than do the general levels of inflation 
management believes the most significant impact on the company s financial results is its ability to react to interest rate changes and endeavors to maintain an essentially balanced position between interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to protect against wide fluctuations in the company s net interest margin

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk and  to a lesser extent  liquidity risk 
all of the company s transactions are denominated in us currency with no specific foreign exchange exposure 
the company has a limited number of agricultural loans and accordingly has no significant exposure to changes in commodity prices 
any impact that changes in foreign exchange rates and commodity prices would have on interest rates are assumed to be insignificant 
interest rate risk irr is the exposure of a banking organization s financial condition to adverse movements in interest rates 
accepting this risk can be an important source of profitability and shareholder value  however excessive levels of irr can significantly impact the company s earnings and capital base 
accordingly  effective risk management that maintains irr at prudent levels is essential to the company s safety and soundness 
evaluating a financial institution s exposure to interest rate changes includes assessing both the adequacy of the management process used to monitor and control irr and the organization s quantitative exposure level 
when assessing the irr management process  the company seeks to ensure that appropriate policies  procedures  management information systems  and internal controls are in place to maintain irr at prudent levels with consistency and continuity 
evaluating the quantitative level of irr exposure requires the company to assess the existing and potential future effects of changes in interest rates on its consolidated financial condition  including capital adequacy  earnings  liquidity  and where appropriate  asset quality 
the federal reserve board  together with the office of the comptroller of the currency and the fdic  adopted a joint agency policy statement on irr 
the policy statement provides guidance to examiners and bankers on sound practices for managing irr  which forms the basis for an ongoing evaluation of the adequacy of irr management at institutions under their respective supervision 
the policy statement also outlines fundamental elements of sound management that have been identified in prior federal reserve guidance and discusses the importance of these elements in the context of managing irr 
specifically  the guidance emphasizes the need for active board of director and senior management oversight and a comprehensive risk management process which effectively identifies  measures  and controls irr 
financial institutions derive their income primarily from the excess of interest collected over interest paid 
the rates of interest an institution earns on its assets and owes on its liabilities generally are established contractually for a period of time 
since market interest rates change over time  an institution is exposed to lower profit margins or losses if it cannot adapt to interest rate changes 
for example  assume that an institution s assets carry intermediate or long term fixed rates and that those assets are funded with short term liabilities 
if market interest rates rise by the time the short term liabilities must be refinanced  the increase in the institution s interest expense on its liabilities may not be sufficiently offset if assets continue to earn at the contractual long term fixed rates 
accordingly  an institution s profits could decrease on existing assets because the institution will either have lower net interest income or  possibly  higher net interest expense 
similar risks exist when assets are subject to contractual interest rate ceilings  or rate sensitive assets are funded by longer term fixed rate liabilities in a decreasing rate environment 
an institution might use various techniques to minimize irr 
one approach used by the company is to analyze its assets and liabilities and make future financing and investment decisions based on payment streams  interest rates  contractual maturities  and estimate sensitivity to actual or potential market interest rate changes 
such activities fall under the broad definition of asset liability management 
the company s primary asset liability management technique is the measurement of its asset liability gap which is defined as the difference between the cash flow amounts of interest sensitive assets and liabilities that will be refinanced or repriced over a given time period 
for example  if the asset amount to be repriced exceeds the corresponding liability amount subject to repricing for a given day  month  year  or longer period  the institution is in an asset sensitive gap position 
in this situation  net interest income would increase if market interest rates rose and conversely decrease if market interest rates fell 
alternatively  if more liabilities than assets will reprice  the institution is in a liability sensitive position 
accordingly  net interest income would decline when rates rose and improve when rates fell 
also  these examples assume that interest rate changes for assets and liabilities are of the same magnitude  whereas actual interest rate changes generally differ in magnitude for assets and liabilities 
several ways an institution can manage irr include selling existing assets or repaying certain liabilities  matching repricing periods for new assets and liabilities for example by  shortening terms of new loans or investments  and hedging existing assets  liabilities  or anticipated transactions 
an institution might also invest in more complex financial instruments intended to hedge or otherwise change irr 
interest rate swaps  futures contracts  options on futures  and other such derivative financial instruments are often used for this purpose 
because these instruments are sensitive to interest rate changes  they require management expertise to be effective 
sfsc has not purchased derivative financial instruments in the past 
financial institutions are also subject to prepayment risk in falling interest rate environments 
for example  mortgage loans and other financial assets may be prepaid by a debtor so that the debtor may refinance its obligations at new  lower interest rates 
prepayments of assets carrying higher rates reduce the company s interest income and overall asset yields 
certain portions of an institution s liabilities may be short term or due on demand  while most of its assets may be invested in long term loans or investments 
accordingly  the company seeks to have in place sources of cash to meet short term demands 
these funds can be obtained by increasing deposits  borrowing  or selling assets 
federal home loan bank advances and short term borrowings provide additional sources of liquidity for the company 
sfsc also has a million line of credit available through a third party financial institution 
the following table sets forth information about the company s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates as of december  the company had no derivative financial instruments  or trading portfolio  as of that date 
the expected maturity date values for loans  mortgage backed securities  and investment securities were calculated adjusting the underlying instrument s contractual maturity date for prepayment expectations 
expected maturity date values for interest bearing deposits were not based upon estimates of the period over which the deposits would be outstanding  but rather the opportunity for repricing 
similarly  with respect to its variable rate instruments  the company believes that repricing dates  as opposed to maturity dates are more relevant in analyzing the value of such instruments and are reported as such in the following table 
company borrowings are also reported based on conversion or repricing dates
