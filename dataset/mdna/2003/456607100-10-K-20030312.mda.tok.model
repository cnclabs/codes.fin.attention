item business we are the holding company for a federal deposit insurance corporation fdic insured savings and loan association 
deposits and advances from the federal home loan bank fhlb of san francisco are two of our key funding sources 
our business model  however  differs significantly from that of most traditional savings and loan institutions 
our primary business is mortgage banking  while most traditional savings and loan associations focus on providing mortgage loans to homeowners in their immediate market areas  retaining more of the loans they originate in their portfolio and deriving most of their income from net interest earned on their mortgage loans 
a mortgage banking company  in contrast  generally originates mortgage loans for sale to investors  and generally services such loans on an on going basis for the investors 
as such  a mortgage banking company has a higher asset turnover rate than a traditional savings and loan  and generates a higher portion of its income from gains on the sale of loans and servicing fees  and a lower portion from net interest income 
mortgage banking is a huge industry  with annual origination volume well in excess of two trillion dollars in the purpose of the discussion of our business model below is to summarize our business strategy  the key factors that drive our profitability and the key operating risks to our future profitability and liquidity 
countrywide financial corporation founded indymac then known as countrywide mortgage investments  inc as a passive mortgage real estate investment trust reit in in response to the global liquidity crisis in the fourth quarter of in which many non regulated financial institutions  mortgage lenders and mortgage reits were adversely impacted or did not survive  we determined that it would be advantageous to become a depository institution 
the depository structure provides significant advantages in the form of diversified financing sources  the retention of capital to support growth and a strong platform for the origination of mortgages 
accordingly  on january  we terminated our status as a reit and converted to a fully taxable entity and on july  we acquired sgv bancorp  inc sgvb  which then was the parent of first federal savings and loan association of san gabriel valley  a federal savings association 
we contributed substantially all of our assets and operations to the subsidiary savings association  which we renamed indymac bank  fsb bank 
our affiliation with countrywide was terminated in march references to indymac bancorp or the parent company refer to the parent company alone  while references to indymac  or the company refer to the parent company and its consolidated subsidiaries 
prior to july  indymac bancorp was named indymac mortgage holdings  inc business model our strategy is to be a leading provider and servicer of home mortgage loans 
we offer many types of home mortgage products using a technology based approach  leveraged across multiple products  channels and 
table of contents customers 
we serve a wide range of customers  including consumers  mortgage brokers  mortgage bankers  community financial institutions  homebuilders and real estate professionals 
according to the national mortgage news  we were one of the top originators of mortgage loans in the united states  with a market share of approximately based on mortgage loan origination volume of billion in our strategic plan contemplates growth in our market share over the next five years 
the environment of historically low interest rates over the past two years has been very favorable for mortgage bankers such as us 
as the industry transitions to a higher interest rate environment  we could see lower levels of growth  or even a reduction  in earnings per share  given the volatility of the industry  in the short run 
we leverage our core mortgage banking expertise by investing in prime mortgage loans  mortgage backed securities  and servicing related assets through our investment portfolio operations 
while these investments support our mortgage banking franchise  they also generate core interest income to diversify and stabilize our earnings base 
we also offer retail banking products and services through our web site at www

our core strategy for our consumer bank has been focused primarily on building consumer relationships while marketing certificates of deposit and money market savings accounts

table of contents when we have accumulated a sufficient volume of loans with similar characteristics  generally million to million in principal amount  we resell the loans in the secondary market 
the length of time between when we purchase a mortgage loan and when we sell or securitize the mortgage loan generally ranges from ten to days  depending on factors such as loan volume by product type and market fluctuations in the prices of mortgage backed securities 
one of our strategies is to reduce the period of time we hold loans before they are sold 
on average during  we sold loans within days of purchase or origination  compared to days during the faster loan turnover rate provides for a more efficient use of our capital  which results in a higher return on average equity 
our mortgage banking revenue consists primarily of gain on the sale of loans  net interest income  and fee income associated with the loans held for sale 
we sell our loans through three distribution channels to the secondary market government sponsored enterprises gses  principally fnma and fhlmc  whole loan sales  and private label securitizations 
additionally  we transfer a small amount of our loans to our investment portfolio  which currently consists primarily of arm loans 
business to business bb www 
indymacbb 
com our bb channel was responsible for of our total production during bb acquires mortgage loans primarily from mortgage brokers and  to a lesser degree  small mortgage bankers and community financial institutions 
when acquiring mortgage loans  we generally purchase the rights to service the mortgage loans as described below 
when we sell the loans  we may either retain the related servicing rights and service the loans through our home loan servicing division or sell those rights 
see loan servicing operations below 
bb s production volume includes both purchases and originations 
originations are defined as loans that are generated by the mortgage broker  but closed in our name also referred to as table funded loans 
bb has a centralized group that targets customers based on their loan production volume  product mix and projected revenue to us 
this sales force is responsible for maintaining and increasing loan production from these customers by marketing bb s strengths  which include a one stop shop for all products  competitive pricing and response time efficiencies in the loan purchase process through our e mits underwriting process and high customer service standards 
during  to continue our emphasis on increasing production capacity and geographic penetration to build market share  the bb division opened a new regional center in kansas city  missouri 
with this new center  along with the pasadena and sacramento california centers and the centers in new jersey and georgia  the bb division currently has five regional centers 
looking ahead  we plan to open additional centers as a way of increasing geographic penetration to gain market share in target markets  improving customer service  and improving operational efficiencies 
business to realtor br www 
loanworks 
com through our loanworks brand  we serve real estate professionals who are interested in cross selling mortgage loans as an additional service to their home purchase clients

br s marketing focus on real estate agents includes participation in local real estate forums  trade shows  seminars and continuing education courses aimed at individual real estate agents  and advertising in national and regional trade publications 
although br is currently small in comparison to the bb and bc divisions  we believe the br channel provides a strong growth opportunity as it leverages our existing technology and infrastructure and recognizes the important role that realtors play in the home purchase mortgage process

our strategy includes developing relationships with homebuilders through direct customer contact and program presentations  as well as drawing upon existing construction lending builder relationships and industry contacts 
similar to our br strategy  the generation of mortgage loans through homebuilders provides a strong growth opportunity in the home purchase loan market 
we also provide construction financing for residential subdivision developers through this division  with a focus on those homebuilders that have committed to utilizing our e mits technology to provide permanent mortgage loans to their customers when they sell the completed residence 
we have limited this activity to eight states california  illinois  nevada  utah  arizona  colorado  washington  and oregon  where we have historically realized strong returns and have long standing relationships with the builders

the heloc product was incorporated into our e mits platform late in in addition to marketing through indymac s bb and bc customer base  the heloc division cross 
table of contents markets to our existing mortgage and banking consumer customers and began a direct mail marketing campaign to the general public in the fourth quarter of while production through direct marketing was small relative to the total heloc production during the fourth quarter  we expect that our direct marketing efforts will contribute substantially to heloc production in the future 
loan sales and securitizations we sell the majority of the mortgage loans that we originate or purchase 
the loans are sold on a non recourse basis  but we make certain representations and warranties concerning the loans 
we generally retain the servicing rights with respect to loans sold to the gses primarily fannie mae and freddie mac 
the credit losses on these loans are absorbed by the gses 
we pay guarantee fees to the gses to compensate them for their assumption of credit risk 
we have recently begun selling loans to the fhlb of san francisco  for which we retain the servicing rights 
loans sold to the fhlb typically contain a risk sharing arrangement in which we benefit from the performance of the loans sold 
this benefit is typically less than basis points of the loan amount sold and is recorded as a residual security classified as trading 
we also sell loans on a whole loan basis to institutional investors who typically acquire the related loan servicing rights 
we also sell loans through private label securitizations 
loans sold through private label securitizations include principally prime non conforming loans and subprime loans 
the securitization process involves the sale of the loans to one of our wholly owned bankruptcy remote special purpose entities which then sells the loans to a separate  transaction specific securitization trust in exchange for cash and certain trust interests that we retain 
the securitization trust issues and sells undivided interests to third party investors that entitle the investors to specified cash flows generated from the securitized loans 
these undivided interests are usually represented by certificates with varying interest rates and are secured by the payments on the loans acquired by the trust  and commonly include senior and subordinated classes 
the senior class securities are usually rated aaa by at least two of the major independent rating agencies and have priority over the subordinated classes in the receipt of payments 
we have no obligation to provide funding support to either the third party investors or securitization trusts 
the third party investors or the securitization trusts have no recourse to our assets or us and have no ability to require us to repurchase their securities 
we do make certain representations and warranties concerning the loans  such as lien status or mortgage insurance coverage  and if we are found to have breached a representation or warranty we could be required to repurchase the loan from the securitization trust 
we do not guarantee any securities issued by the securitization trusts 
the securitization trusts represent qualified special purpose entities  which meet the legal isolation criteria of statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for transfer and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities sfas  and are therefore not consolidated for financial reporting purposes 
in addition to the cash the securitization trust pays for the loans  we often retain certain interests in the securitization trust as payment for the loans 
these retained interests may include mortgage servicing rights msrs  aaa rated interest only securities  subordinated classes of securities  residual securities  cash reserve funds  or an overcollateralization account 
other than aaa rated interest only securities and msrs  these retained interests are subordinated and serve as credit enhancement for the more senior securities issued by the securitization trust 
we are entitled to receive full payment on most of these retained interests only after the third party investors are repaid their investment plus interest  but  we may receive current payments if there is excess cash in the securitization trust 
our ability to obtain repayment of our residual interests depends solely on the performance of the underlying mortgage loans 
material adverse changes in performance of the loans  including actual credit losses and prepayment speeds  may have a significant adverse effect on the value of these retained interests 
we usually retain the servicing function for the securitized mortgage loans 
see description of servicing operations below under the caption loan servicing operations 
as a servicer  we are entitled to receive a servicing fee equal to a specified percentage of the outstanding principal balance of the loans 
this servicing fee is calculated and payable on a monthly basis 
we may also be entitled to receive additional servicing compensation  such as late payment fees or prepayment penalties 
our servicing fees have priority in payment over the senior classes of securities issued by the securitization trusts 

table of contents in our servicer capacity  we usually retain an option to purchase the remaining loans if the amount of outstanding loans falls to a level  commonly of the original balance  at which the cost of servicing becomes burdensome in relation to the benefits we receive as servicer 
these options are commonly referred to as clean up calls 
we typically do not exercise our right to call unless the fair value of the outstanding loans we would acquire would exceed the cost to acquire such loans 
in addition to securitization trusts  we use net interest margin nim trusts  from time to time  to securitize our interest in residual securities from prior or recently completed securitization transactions 
nim trusts issue bonds to outside investors secured by the residual securities we contribute to the trusts 
the cash proceeds from the sale of the nim bonds to investors are paid to us by the nim trusts as payment for the residual securities 
the nim bonds are obligations of the nim trusts and are collateralized only by the residual securities 
we are not obligated to make any payments on the bonds 
these entities represent qualified special purpose entities and are therefore not consolidated for financial reporting purposes in accordance with sfas at inception  the outside investors have the majority interest in the fair value of the residual securities 
we receive cash flows from our retained interests in the nim trusts once the bonds issued to the investors are fully paid off 
at december   these nim trusts held assets valued at million and our retained interests in these nim trusts are valued at million 
the bonds issued on one of the nim trusts were fully paid off in january and our retained interest in this nim trust was valued at million at december  our retained interests in the nim trusts are included as a component of securities classified as trading securities on our consolidated balance sheets 
investment portfolio investments to generate continuing earnings that are more stable and complement the mortgage banking group  we invest in residential mortgage loans  mortgage securities  us treasury securities and msrs either retained in connection with our mortgage banking activities or purchased in the secondary mortgage market 
the strategy of our investment portfolio is to provide support for our mortgage banking divisions through its ability to invest in whole loans and retain assets from loan sales and securitizations  acquire loans  servicing and securities in the secondary market  and hedge the interest rate and prepayment risks attendant with servicing related assets 
at december   total assets of our investment portfolio were billion  of which were residential mortgage loans  were mortgage securities available for sale afs securities  were trading securities  and were msrs 
our policy is that all of our investment portfolio assets  including assets acquired from the mortgage banking group  must meet or exceed minimum targeted return requirements 
mortgage loans held for investment are originated or acquired through our mortgage banking activities and transferred to the investment portfolio for long term investment 
such loans are typically prime loans as the majority of the subprime loans originated by mortgage banking are securitized in private transactions or sold to gses 
investment portfolio invests in loans for which it can earn an acceptable return on equity  currently investing primarily in arms in order to minimize interest rate risk  and loan products which we believe the market does not properly price 
we may also retain all or a portion of the loans acquired through our exercise of clean up calls as these loans are generally high quality  seasoned loans that generate an above market yield 
a substantial portion of the servicing related assets retained by the investment portfolio are generated in connection with issuances of private label securities and agency loan sales by our mortgage bank 
retained assets typically include msrs and  to a lesser degree  aaa rated and agency interest only securities  non investment grade securities and residuals 
in addition to retaining assets from our private label securitizations and agency loan sales  the investment portfolio also purchases mortgage backed securities issued by other lenders in the secondary mortgage market 
at december   of the investment securities portfolio was comprised of aaa rated securities  of other investment grade securities and of non investment grade securities and residuals 
our investment grade securities include aaa rated and agency interest only securities  agency mortgage backed securities and debentures  and other mortgage backed securities 
in 
table of contents addition to hedging the aaa rated and agency interest only securities portfolio  the investment portfolio also manages and hedges our investment in msrs 
substantially all msrs were created in connection with our mortgage banking activities and include both primary and master servicing  as further discussed below 
however  we may purchase msrs from other servicers if we believe the investment will generate appropriate returns 
the primary sources of revenue for the investment portfolio are net interest income on loans and securities and service fee income from msrs 
valuation changes related to msrs subject to lower of amortized cost or fair value limitations  aaa rated and agency interest only securities and their related hedges are also recognized through earnings 
periodically  trading gains or losses may also be recognized through earnings  although trading is not a core investment portfolio activity 
loan servicing operations at december   through our home loan servicing operation in kalamazoo  michigan  we serviced billion of mortgage loans  of which billon were owned by us 
the servicing portfolio includes servicing for prime and subprime loans  home equity lines of credit  manufactured housing loans and home improvement loans 
servicing of mortgage loans includes collecting loan payments  responding to customers inquiries  accounting for principal and interest  holding custodial impound funds for payment of property taxes and insurance  making physical inspections of the mortgaged property  as necessary  counseling delinquent mortgagors  modifying loans  supervising foreclosures and liquidation of foreclosed property  performing required tax reporting  and other loan administration functions necessary to protect investors interests and comply with applicable laws and regulations 
servicing operations also include remitting loan payments  less servicing fees  to trustees and  in some cases  advancing delinquent borrower payments to investors  subject to a right of reimbursement 
master servicing includes collecting loan payments from servicers of loans including third parties and remitting loan payments  less master servicing fees  to trustees for the related securitizations 
as master servicer  we monitor the primary servicer s compliance with our servicing agreements and we are required to perform  or to contract with a third party to perform  all obligations not adequately performed by any servicer 
the master servicer may permit or require the servicer to contract with approved subservicers to perform some or all of the servicer s duties  but the servicer retains its servicing obligations 
as of december   we were the master servicer for billion of prime and subprime mortgage loans  of which billion was serviced on a primary basis by third party servicers

key operating risks like all businesses  we assume a certain amount of risk in order to earn returns on our capital 
the following is a summary discussion of key operating risks 
for further information on these and other key operating risks  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents interest rate risk due to the characteristics of our financial assets and liabilities and the nature of our business activities  our financial position and results of operations may be materially affected by changes in interest rates in various ways 
while we have devised and implemented a comprehensive asset liability management strategy that seeks  on an economic and an accounting basis  to mitigate significant fluctuations in our financial position and results of operations likely to be caused by market interest rate changes  there can be no assurance that this strategy including assumptions concerning the correlation thought to exist between different types of instruments or its implementation will be successful in any particular interest rate environment 
valuation risk in connection with the loan sale process  we retain certain assets for which the market is limited and illiquid 
as a result  valuations are derived using complex modeling and significant assumptions and judgments  rather than third party market quotations or sale information to value such assets 
the assets include aaa rated and agency interest only securities  msrs  non investment grade securities and residuals 
in addition  from time to time  we may acquire these types of securities from third party issuers 
these assets represented of total assets and of total equity at december  the fair value of these assets could vary significantly as market conditions change 
credit risk our investment portfolio consists primarily of loans for investment  and non investment grade securities and residuals collateralized by mortgage loans 
we also provide construction lending to consumers and developers to build residential properties which have a higher risk profile than permanent mortgage loans 
while the majority of our loans are secured by residential property  there is no guarantee that  in the event of borrower default  we will be able to recoup the full principal amount and interest earned on a loan 
we have adopted underwriting and loan quality monitoring systems  procedures and credit policies  including the establishment and review of the allowance for loan losses  that management believes are prudent and appropriate to minimize this risk by tracking loan performance  assessing the likelihood of nonperformance and diversifying our loan portfolio 
such policies and procedures  however  may not prevent unexpected losses that could adversely affect our results 
in addition  while we have discontinued our home improvement and manufactured housing lending programs  we continue to liquidate portfolios of these loans  which have greater credit risk than that of our mortgage loan portfolios 
at december   the book value of these portfolios was million  net of reserves 
we also sell loans to gses and to outside investors 
in these instances  we are subject to repurchase risk in the event of breaches of representations or warranties we make in connection with the loan sales 
while we have established what we believe to be adequate secondary marketing reserves  there can be no guarantee that the amount reserved is sufficient to cover all potential losses resulting from such repurchases 
liquidity risk access to capital markets we finance a substantial portion of our assets through consumer deposits insured by the fdic and through borrowings from the fhlb of san francisco 
we also obtain financing from investment banks 
there is no guarantee that these sources of funds will continue to be available to us  or that our borrowings can be refinanced upon maturity  although we are not aware of any trends  events or uncertainties that we believe are reasonably likely to cause a decrease in our liquidity from these sources 
we utilize three sales channels to sell loans to the secondary market whole loan sales  sales to the gses  and private label securitizations 
a disruption in the securitization market could adversely impact our ability to fund mortgage loans and our gains on sale  leading to a corresponding decrease in revenue and earnings 
likewise  a deterioration in the performance of our private label securities could adversely impact the availability and pricing of future transactions 

table of contents governmental regulation and monetary policy the banking industry in general is extensively regulated at the federal and state levels 
insured depository institutions and their holding companies are subject to comprehensive regulation  supervision  and examination by financial regulatory authorities covering all aspects of their organization  management and operations 
the office of thrift supervision ots and the fdic are the primary federal regulatory agencies for us and our affiliated entities 
in addition to their regulatory powers  these two agencies also have significant enforcement authority that they can use to address unsafe and unsound banking practices  violations of laws  and capital and operational deficiencies 
accordingly  the actions of those governmental authorities responsible for regulatory  fiscal and monetary affairs can have a significant impact on the activities of financial services firms such as ours 
our operations are also subject to regulation at the state level  including a variety of consumer protection provisions 
banking institutions are further affected by the various monetary and fiscal policies of the us government  which can influence financial regulatory actions 
competition we face significant competition in acquiring and selling loans 
in our mortgage banking operations  we compete with other mortgage bankers  gses  established third party lending programs  investment banking firms  banks  savings and loan associations  and other lenders and entities purchasing mortgage assets 
with regard to mortgage backed securities issued through our mortgage banking operations  we face competition from other investment opportunities available to prospective investors 
we estimate our market share of the us mortgage market to be less than 
a number of our competitors have significantly larger market share and financial resources 
while we believe our small market share creates opportunities for growth  there is no assurance that we can effectively compete with these entities 
the gses have made and we believe will continue to make significant technological and economic advances to broaden their customer bases 
when the gses contract or expand  there are both positive and negative impacts on our mortgage banking lending operations 
as gses expand  additional liquidity is brought to the market  and loan products can be resold more quickly 
conversely  expanding gses increase competition for loans  which may reduce profit margins on loan sales 
we seek to address these competitive pressures by making a strong effort to maximize our use of technology  by diversifying into other mortgage products that are less affected by gses  and by operating in a more cost effective manner than our competitors 
there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful 
the primary competition for our mortgage banking activities comes from banks and other financial institutions and mortgage companies 
we seek to compete with financial institutions and mortgage companies through an emphasis on quality of service  diversified products and maximum use of technology 
other risks we are subject to various other risks  including changes in the demand for mortgage loans  which historically tends to decrease as interest rates increase 
also  a majority of our loan acquisitions are geographically concentrated in certain states  including california  new york  florida and new jersey 
any adverse economic conditions in these markets could cause the number of loans acquired to decrease and delinquencies to increase  causing a corresponding decline in revenues 
lastly  there are no guarantees as to our degree of success in managing loan portfolio concentrations  anticipating and taking advantage of technological advances  or executing upon our growth plans for our mortgage banking operations 
regulation and supervision general as a savings and loan holding company  indymac bancorp is subject to regulation by the ots under the savings association holding company provisions of the federal home owners loan act hola 
as a federally chartered and insured savings association  we are subject to regulation  supervision and periodic 
table of contents examination by the ots  which is the primary federal regulator of savings associations  and the fdic  in its role as federal deposit insurer 
the primary purpose of regulatory examination and supervision is to protect depositors  financial institutions and the financial system as a whole rather than the shareholders of financial institutions or their holding companies 
the following summary is not intended to be a complete description of the applicable laws and regulations or their effects on us  and it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provisions described 
regulation of indymac bank general we are required to file periodic reports with the ots concerning our activities and financial condition 
the ots has substantial enforcement authority with respect to savings associations  including authority to bring enforcement actions against a savings association and any of its institution affiliated parties  which term includes directors  officers  employees  controlling shareholders  agents and other persons who participate in the conduct of the affairs of the institution

in addition  we are subject to regulations of the federal reserve board relating to equal credit opportunity  electronic fund transfers  collection of checks  truth in lending  truth in savings  and availability of funds for deposit customers 
qualified thrift lender test like all savings associations  we are required to meet a qualified thrift lender qtl test to avoid certain restrictions on our operations  including the activities restrictions applicable to multiple savings and loan holding companies  restrictions on our ability to branch interstate and indymac bancorp s mandatory registration as a bank holding company under the bank holding company act of a savings association satisfies the qtl test if i on a monthly average basis in at least nine months out of each twelve month period  at least of a specified asset base of the savings association consists of loans to small businesses  credit card loans  educational loans  or certain assets related to domestic residential real estate  including residential mortgage loans and mortgage securities  or ii at least of the savings association s total assets consist of cash  us government or government agency debt or equity securities  fixed assets  or loans secured by deposits  real property used for residential  educational  church  welfare  or health purposes  or real property in certain urban renewal areas 
we are currently and expect to remain in compliance with qtl standards 
regulatory capital requirements ots capital regulations require savings associations to satisfy three capital ratio requirements tangible capital  tier core leverage capital  and risk based capital 
in general  an association s tangible capital  which must be at least of adjusted total assets  is the sum of common shareholders equity adjusted for the effects of other comprehensive income oci  less goodwill and other disallowed assets 
an association s ratio of tier core capital to adjusted total assets the core capital or leverage ratio must be at least for the most highly rated associations and for others 
higher capital ratios may be required if warranted by the particular circumstances or risk profile of a given association 
under the risk based capital requirement  a savings association must have total capital core capital plus supplementary capital equal to at least of risk weighted assets 
tier capital must represent at least of total capital and consists of core capital elements  which include common shareholders equity qualifying noncumulative nonredeemable perpetual preferred stock  and minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries  but exclude goodwill and certain other intangible assets 
supplementary capital mainly consists of qualifying subordinated debt and portions of allowance for loan losses 
the above capital requirements are viewed as minimum standards by the ots 
the ots regulations also specify minimum requirements for a savings association to be considered a well capitalized institution as defined in the prompt corrective action regulation described below 
a well capitalized savings association must have a total risk based capital ratio of or greater  and a leverage ratio of or greater 
additionally  to qualify as a well capitalized institution  a savings association s tier risk based capital  defined as core 
table of contents capital plus supplementary capital less portions of the association s allowance for loan losses  must be equal to at least of risk weighted assets 
as a condition to the ots approval of the acquisition of sgvb in july of  we have been required by the ots to hold tier core capital at for three years following the consummation of the transaction and to maintain a well capitalized risk based capital portion 
we currently meet all of the requirements of a well capitalized institution as well as the additional capital condition to the ots approval of the sgvb acquisition 
the ots regulations contain prompt corrective action provisions that require certain mandatory remedial actions and authorize certain other discretionary actions to be taken by the ots against a savings association that falls within specified categories of capital deficiency 
the relevant regulations establish five categories of capital classification for this purpose  ranging from well capitalized or adequately capitalized through undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized 
in general  the prompt corrective action regulations prohibit an ots regulated institution from declaring any dividends  making any other capital distributions  or paying a management fee to a controlling person  such as its parent holding company  if  following the distribution or payment  the institution would be within any of the three undercapitalized categories 
insurance of deposit accounts deposits of the bank are presently insured by the savings association insurance fund saif  which is administered by the fdic  up to  per depositor 
the fdic has established a risk based system for setting deposit insurance assessments 
under the risk based assessment system  a savings association s insurance assessments vary according to the level of capital the institution holds and the degree to which it is the subject of supervisory concern 
insurance of deposits may be terminated by the fdic upon a finding that the savings association has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices  is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law  regulation  rule  order or condition imposed by the fdic or the ots 
capital distribution regulations ots regulations limit capital distributions by savings association  which include  among other things  dividends and payments for stock repurchases 
a savings association that is a subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company must notify the ots of an association capital distribution at least days prior to the proposed declaration of dividend or the approval by the association s board of directors of the proposed capital distribution 
the day period provides the ots an opportunity to object to the proposed distribution if it believes that the distribution would not be advisable 
an application to the ots for specific approval to pay a dividend  rather than the notice procedure described above  is required if a the total of all capital distributions made during a calendar year including the proposed distribution exceeds the sum of the institution s year to date net income and its retained income for the preceding two years  b the institution is not eligible under ots regulations for expedited treatment which is generally available to institutions the ots regards as well run and adequately capitalized  c the institution would not be at least adequately capitalized following the proposed capital distribution  or d the distribution would violate an applicable statute  regulation  agreement  or condition imposed on the institution by the ots 
community reinvestment act and the fair lending laws savings associations are examined under the community reinvestment act cra and related regulations of the ots on the extent of their efforts to help meet the credit needs of their communities  including low and moderate income neighborhoods 
in addition  the equal credit opportunity act and the fair housing act  together known as the fair lending laws  prohibit lenders from discriminating in their lending practices on the basis of characteristics specified in those statutes 
enforcement of these regulations has been an important focus of federal regulatory authorities and of community groups in recent years 
a failure by us to comply with the provisions of the cra could  at a minimum  result in adverse action on 
table of contents branch and certain other corporate applications  and regulatory restrictions on its activities  and failure to comply with the fair lending laws could result in enforcement actions by the ots  as well as other federal regulatory agencies and the department of justice 
we obtained an overall satisfactory rating during our most recent cra evaluation 
privacy protection the ots has adopted privacy protection regulations which require each savings association to adopt procedures to protect consumers and customers nonpublic personal information 
it is our policy not to share customers information with any unaffiliated third parties  except as expressly permitted by law  or to allow third party companies to provide marketing services on our behalf  or under joint marketing agreements between us and other unaffiliated financial institutions 
in addition to federal laws and regulations  we are required to comply with any privacy requirements prescribed by california and other states in which we do business that afford consumers with protections greater than those provided under federal law 
federal income tax considerations we report our income on a calendar year basis using the accrual method of accounting and are subject to federal income taxation in the same manner as other corporations with certain exceptions 
through december   indymac bancorp elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code 
as a result of this election  indymac bancorp was not  with certain limited exceptions  taxed at the corporate level on the net income distributed to its shareholders 
indymac bancorp converted from a reit to a fully taxable entity  effective january of employees as of december   we had  full time equivalent employees  including temporary employees

our broad customer base includes consumers  mortgage brokers  mortgage bankers  community financial institutions  homebuilders and real estate professionals 
we offer a wide range of home mortgage products using a technology based approach 
mortgage banking operations are characterized by high asset turnover the production and sale of mortgage loans and efficient utilization of capital but can be cyclical in nature depending on interest rates 
revenues generated by mortgage banking operations include gain on sale of mortgage loans  fee income and net interest income during the period loans are held pending sale 
investment portfolio activities consist primarily of investments in single family residential mortgage loans  also referred to as sfrs  mortgage securities and msrs 
we also provide loans to consumers and to subdivision developers to construct single family residences 
the portfolio activities tend to provide a more stable source of revenues  comprised primarily of net interest income and servicing fees 
see item business for further descriptions of our operating segments 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements  and the notes thereto and the other information incorporated by reference herein

we sold billion and billion of loans during the years ended december  and  respectively 
our gain on sale of loans increased during the year to million  from million in the increase in the gain on sale was a result of the increase in loans sold  as well as the increase in profit margin  net of hedging gains and losses 
we hedge the interest rate risk inherent in our pipeline of mortgage loans held for sale 
in a period of declining interest rates  hedging has the effect of reducing the gain on sale of our mortgage loans 
in a period of rising rates  hedging protects us from deterioration in our net loan sale margin 
the table below illustrates the impact of our pipeline hedging activities 
year ended december  change dollars in millions gross gain on mortgage loan sales gross loan sale margin before hedging hedging losses net gains on sale net loan sale margin after hedging 
table of contents in addition to the gain on sale  we earn net interest and fee income on our mortgage loans held for sale 
we believe it is important to look at the entire mortgage banking revenue stream in evaluating performance as these components may vary in differing interest rate environments and sale strategies 
the following table shows the total revenue margin on mortgage loans sold  which is calculated by dividing the sum of gain on the sale of loans  net interest income refer to note segment reporting in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our method of allocating interest expense to the operating segments  and fee income by the amount of loans sold year ended december  of loans of loans sold sold dollars in thousands gain on sale of loans net interest income fee income total mortgage banking revenue loans sold the following table shows the distribution channels through which we sold loans 
year ended december  distribution distribution percentages percentages dollars in millions sales to gses private label securitizations whole loan sales subtotal sales investment portfolio acquisitions total loan distribution government sponsored enterprises  principally fnma and fhlmc 
loan production that we elected to retain in our investment portfolio 
the percentage of loans sold through securitizations increased substantially in compared to due to enhanced liquidity in the residential mortgage backed securitization market  which resulted in better execution being achieved more often through securitizations as compared to whole loan sales 
we believe that it is important to have the flexibility to sell loans across all of these channels 
having a diverse distribution strategy enhances our ability to obtain the best execution on our sales of mortgage loans and reduces our risk to exposure if one or more of these channels become disrupted 
in conjunction with the sale of mortgage loans in private label securitization and gse transactions  we generally retain certain assets 
the primary assets retained include msrs and  to a lesser degree  aaa rated and agency interest only securities  non investment grade securities and residual securities servicing related assets 
the allocated cost of the retained assets at the time of sale is recorded as an asset with an offsetting increase to the gain on sale of loans or a reduction in the cost basis of the loans sold 
the calculation of the million in gain on sale of loans earned during the year ended december  included the retention of million of servicing related assets 
more information on the valuation assumptions related to our retained assets can be found under valuation of servicing related assets below 

table of contents mortgage production by channel our primary mortgage production channel is our business to business bb channel through which we acquire loans from mortgage brokers  mortgage bankers and community financial institutions 
the next largest channel is our direct to consumer channel bc  which markets to consumers on a decentralized basis through our web site at indymacmortgage 
com  links to other web based marketers and direct mail and telemarketing 
in addition to these two key channels  we produce mortgage loans through real estate agents br loanworks  through our retail branch network  and through relationships with homebuilders

active customers are defined as those mortgage brokers that actually funded a loan with us during the year plus new mortgage brokers during the year that may not yet have completed a loan funding with us 
residential construction lending we provide construction financing for individual consumers who are in the process of building their own home consumer construction and for residential subdivision developers builder construction 
with respect to consumer construction  the primary product is a construction to permanent mortgage loan 
this product provides financing for the month term of construction and automatically rolls to a permanent mortgage loan at the end of construction 
as a result  this product represents a hybrid activity between our portfolio lending activities and our mortgage banking activities 
we earn net interest income during the construction phase and when the loan converts to permanent status the loan is transferred into our pipeline of mortgage loans held for sale 
these loans are typically fixed rate loans 
consumer construction loans outstanding at december  were million  up compared to the amount at december  we market our consumer construction products nationwide  primarily through our bb channel  but also through all of our other distribution channels 

table of contents we work with homebuilders in selected markets to provide our mortgage loan products 
with respect to builder construction financing  our focus is directed to those homebuilders that provide our mortgage loans to their customers when they sell the completed residence 
we also have a targeted geographic focus in this product centered on eight states california  illinois  nevada  utah  arizona  colorado  washington  oregon where we have a strong history of performance and established homebuilder relationships 
we typically price our builder construction loans at a spread over prime interest rates 
builder construction loans outstanding at december  were million  down compared to december   as a result of narrowing our focus to targeting the product in eight core states

at this time  the bc channel is more closely associated with the refinance environment  both from the perspective of refinancing the customers of our servicing portfolio and because consumers are more willing to refinance an existing mortgage over the web 
our experience to date has been that consumers in the process of purchasing a new home are significantly influenced in their mortgage decision by their real estate agent 
our bb channel is more closely aligned to the purchase market as these lenders tend to have established relationships with realtors 
our br and homebuilder channels  while still relatively small  are also expected to align our production more closely with consumers seeking a mortgage to finance the purchase or construction of a home and are expected to help to mitigate the cyclicality of the bc channel should interest rates rise 
heloc unit during  we established a business unit to focus on the production of prime quality home equity lines of credit  or helocs 
our heloc product offers consumers access to their credit line through both equity checks and a visa credit card 
the heloc product was incorporated into our e mits platform late in in addition to marketing through our bb and bc customer base  the heloc division cross markets to our existing mortgage and banking consumer customers and began a direct mail marketing campaign to the 
table of contents general public late in the fourth quarter of while production through direct marketing was small relative to the total heloc production during the fourth quarter  we expect that our direct marketing efforts will contribute substantially to heloc production in the future 
we believe that helocs will be an attractive way for consumers to access equity in their homes when the current refinance cycle ends 
this product is expected to be counter cyclical to the traditional mortgage banking cycle and help provide stability to our earnings

table of contents the returns on our investment portfolio were lower in than in primarily as a result of the cumulative impact of accelerated prepayments in the third and fourth quarters of this year 
higher yielding assets have been replaced with lower yielding assets in the current low interest rate environment 
in addition  the repricing of the financing liabilities tends to lag the repricing of the assets in a duration matched portfolio during periods of faster than expected prepayments  which has the effect of compressing the net interest margin 
similarly  as prepayments shorten the expected duration of the portfolio of msrs  the discount rate decreases relative to the shorter life of the asset 
all other things being equal  we expect that the performance of our investment portfolio will improve as interest rates rise and prepayments slow to more normal levels 
mortgage loans held for investment our portfolio of mortgage loans held for investment is comprised of single family residential mortgage loans  with a concentration of adjustable rate loans to manage interest rate risk in funding these assets

all securities are recorded at fair value 
securities that we consider as hedges of our aaa rated and agency interest only securities  residual securities and msrs are carried as trading securities in order to reflect changes in their fair values in current income 
in addition  aaa rated and agency interest only securities and non investment grade residual securities are classified as trading so that the accounting reflects the economic hedging activities 
all other mortgage backed securities are classified as available for sale 
we estimate the fair value of our other investment grade and non investment grade mortgage backed securities based on market information  when available  or with discounted cash flow techniques using assumptions for credit losses  prepayment rates  and market yield requirements 
for those securities used as hedges on our aaa rated and agency interest only securities  residual securities or msrs  adjustments to the carrying value of the security are recorded through earnings trading securities while adjustments to the carrying value of all other securities available for sale are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income in shareholders equity

table of contents of the total investment at december   million was collateralized by prime loans  million by subprime loans and million by manufactured housing loans 
during the third quarter of  we reclassified our portfolio of non investment grade residual securities from the available for sale to the trading classification 
this reclassification was done so that our accounting results would more closely match our economic hedging activities 
we also transferred to the trading from the available for sale classification certain aaa rated non agency securities that are intended to hedge the interest rate risk associated with residual securities 
the transfer of residual securities from available for sale to trading resulted in a million reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to gain on mortgage backed securities 
we no longer intend to hold any residual securities as available for sale 
all new residuals will be recorded as trading securities

therefore  contractual maturity is not a relevant measure of the timing of our future expected cash flows 
actual economic cash flows are expected to be received much sooner 
aaa rated and agency interest only securities and residuals we evaluate the carrying value of our aaa rated and agency interest only securities and residual securities by discounting estimated net future cash flows 
for these securities  estimated net future cash flows are primarily based on assumptions related to prepayment speeds  in addition to expected credit loss assumptions on the residual and non investment grade securities

previously  the entire contractual servicing fee was capitalized on the balance sheet as msrs 
under the new agreement  the contractual servicing fee is separated into a reduced servicing fee of basis points the base servicing fee and an excess yield certificate agency interest only security for amounts above the base servicing fee 
the base servicing fee continues to be capitalized as msrs  while the excess yield certificate is now included in trading securities and accounted for similar to the aaa rated interest only securities 
while the amount of the total servicing fees and related cash flow expected to be derived from servicing the loans were not impacted by the modification  the change in balance sheet classification will result in two primary benefits 
first  the excess yield certificate will be marked to market through the income statement  and will no longer be subject to the lower of cost or market limitations applicable to msrs 
this will directly align the hedge accounting treatment for the asset with actual economic hedging results 
second  the excess yield certificate is now risk weighted at for regulatory capital purposes instead of the higher requirement for msrs 
during  we reclassified million of capitalized msrs to trading securities pursuant to this agreement 
mortgage servicing and mortgage servicing rights in addition to our own loans  we serviced billion of mortgage loans owned by others at december  with a weighted average coupon of and were the master servicer on billion of mortgage loans 
the table below shows the activity in the master and primary servicing portfolios during the year ended december  master primary dollars in millions unpaid principal balance at december  additions clean up calls loan payments unpaid principal balance at december  
table of contents msrs related to these servicing portfolios totaled million as of december  and million as of december   reflecting a decrease of million  due to the fact that impairment before hedge gains and amortization related to these assets combined with the transfer of million in capitalized excess servicing fees to aaa rated and agency interest only securities  exceeded the value of new additions 
the table that follows shows the activity in our msrs 
year ended december  dollars in thousands balance at beginning of period net additions transfers to aaa rated and agency interest only securities scheduled amortization deferred hedging gains provision for valuation impairment balance at end of period at december   the valuation allowance related to msr impairment totaled million 
historically  in most instances  we have been able to substantially offset impairment losses with hedging gains 
as master servicer for our various securitizations  we retain the right to call the securities when the outstanding loan balance in the securitization trust declines to a specified level  typically  of the original balance 
when the fair value of remaining loans exceeds expected costs to exercise the call  we will typically exercise our option 
during  we acquired million in loans pursuant to clean up calls 
based on our estimates of prepayments in our securitization trusts  we anticipate that approximately billion in loans will be eligible for clean up calls during these loans typically have interest rates above current market rates  and as such  can be sold for gains or retained as attractive portfolio investments 
a portion of the loans we acquire pursuant to clean up calls will be delinquent or non performing 
thus  it is possible that the absolute levels of non performing loans held by us may increase temporarily between the time of the call exercise and the disposition of these loans

loans sold with servicing retained only  does not include a total of billion and billion in indymac owned loans  manufactured housing loans  and loans subserviced for others on an interim basis at december  and  respectively 
the lifetime prepayment speeds represent the annualized constant prepayment rate cpr we estimate for the remaining life of the collateral supporting the asset 
for msrs and aaa rated and agency interest only securities  we project prepayment rates using four factor prepayment models which incorporate the relative weighted average note rate  seasoning  seasonality and burn out of the pool of loans relative to expectations of future rates implied by the forward libor swap curve 
the weighted average multiple for msrs  aaa rated and agency interest only and residual securities represents the book value divided by the product of collateral balance and interest strip 
while the weighted average life of such assets is a function of the undiscounted cash flows  the multiple is a function of the discounted cash flows 
with regard to aaa rated and agency interest only securities  the marketplace frequently uses calculated multiples to assess the overall impact valuation assumptions have on value 
collateral type  coupon  loan age and the size of the interest strip must be considered when comparing these multiples 
the decrease in discount yields for aaa rated and agency interest only securities  prime residual securities and msrs is primarily due to the lower interest rate environment in existence at december  and reduced option costs attendant with lower rates  as calculated by our valuation models 
in addition  the significant increase in estimated lifetime prepayment speeds shortens the average life of the asset cash flow  also reducing the discount yield 
this effect serves to somewhat offset the impact of volatile prepayment speeds caused by interest rate changes 

table of contents hedging interest rate risk on servicing related assets with respect to the investment in servicing related assets aaa rated and agency interest only securities  non investment grade residual securities and msrs  we are exposed to interest rate risk as a result of other than predicted prepayment of loans 
investment portfolio is responsible for the management of interest rate and prepayment risks  subject to policies and procedures established by our management level asset and liability committee alco and board of directors level alco 
to hedge our investments in servicing related assets  we use several strategies  including investing in aaa rated principal only securities  buying and or selling mortgage backed or us treasury securities  futures  floors  swaps or options  depending on several factors 
we utilize hedging instruments to reduce our exposure to interest rate risk  not to speculate on the direction of market interest rates

the improvement was due to growth in mortgage loans held for sale and for investment at wider spreads to our financing costs  combined with the repricing of million of higher cost term fhlb advances and million of higher cost certificates of deposit to significantly lower coupons 
in addition  the basis point reduction in the federal funds rate during the fourth quarter resulted in a decline in short term libor indices on the bank s floating rate advances

table of contents interest rate risk management in addition to our hedging activities to mitigate the interest rate risk in our pipeline of mortgage loans held for sale and our investment in servicing related assets  we perform extensive overall interest rate risk analyses that we consider in our interest rate risk management activities 
the primary measurement tool we use to evaluate overall risk is a net portfolio value npv analysis that simulates the effects on shareholders equity of a change in interest rates 
the npv analysis estimates the fair value of our assets  minus the estimated fair value of our liabilities  plus the estimated fair value of off balance sheet contracts and other derivative instruments  under interest rate simulations represented by immediate  permanent and parallel movements in interest rates of plus and minus  and basis points from the actual term structure of interest rates at any quarter end 
the following table sets forth the npv and change in npv for the our market risk sensitive instruments that we estimate might result from a basis point change in interest rates as of december  and december  our npv model has been built to focus on the bank alone as the million of assets at the holding company have very little interest rate risk exposure

significant changes include more sensitivity in the msrs asset due to a larger portfolio size and lower weighted average coupons 
it should be noted that this analysis does not reflect the changes in volumes and profits from our mortgage banking operations that could be expected to result from changes in the interest rate environment 
the assumptions inherent in our interest rate shock models include valuation changes in an instantaneous and parallel rate shock and assumptions as to the degree of correlation between the hedges and hedged assets and liabilities 
these assumptions may not adequately reflect factors such as the spread widening or spread 
table of contents tightening risk among the changes in rates on treasury  libor swap curve and mortgages 
in addition  the sensitivity analysis described in the prior paragraph is limited by the fact that it is performed at a particular point in time and does not incorporate other factors that would impact our financial performance in these scenarios  such as increases in income associated with the increase in production volume that could result from a decrease in interest rates 
consequently  the preceding estimates should not be viewed as a forecast  and it is reasonable to expect that actual results could vary significantly from the analyses discussed above 
our management level and board of directors level alco members monitor our hedging activities to attempt to ensure that the value of hedges  their correlation to the balance sheet item being hedged  and the amounts being hedged  continue to provide effective protection against interest rate risk 
while there can be no assurances that our interest rate management strategies will be effective  we believe we have adequate internal controls to monitor and manage our interest rate risk within reasonable levels

this compares to an allowance for loan losses of million  or of total loans held for investment  at december  the decrease in the allowance for loan losses of million from december  to december  was primarily due to a reduction of million in the allowance related to the discontinued product lines  as the manufactured housing and home improvement portfolios continued to liquidate and we fully charged off the remaining items in our warehouse lending portfolio 
notwithstanding the decrease in the allowance  the ratio of the allowance for losses to non performing loans increased from to from december  to december   respectively  due to the decline in non performing assets npas 
loans are generally placed on non accrual status when they are days past due 
npas include non performing loans and foreclosed assets 
the balance of our assets acquired in foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure is recorded at estimated net realizable value 
npas declined relative to the balance at december  as a result of the balance sheet growth during the fourth quarter  the ratio of npas to total assets improved even further to at december  from at december  our determination of the level of the allowance for loan losses and  correspondingly  the provision for loan losses  is based on management s judgments and assumptions regarding various matters  including general economic conditions  loan portfolio composition  delinquency trends and prior loan loss experience 
in assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  management reviews the performance in the portfolios of loans held for investment and the non core portfolio of discontinued product lines which consist primarily of manufactured housing loans and home improvement loans 

table of contents with respect to the portfolio of loans held for investment in our core businesses  the allowance for loan losses at december  was million or of loan balances  comparable to the at december  net charge offs on these core portfolios during were million  up from million during while the level of charge offs increased during  the increase was primarily related to two builder construction loans and one builder mortgage loan for which total specific reserves of million had previously been provided 
we completed the foreclosure proceedings on these three loans during the fourth quarter and the related loss was charged against the specific reserves 
the overall asset quality trend for the core portfolio is stable as the increase in reo through migration of loans through the foreclosure process was offset by a decrease in non performing loans 
with respect to our non core liquidating portfolios  consisting primarily of manufactured housing and home improvement loans  net charge offs totaled million during  down from the million of charge offs on these portfolios during after provision for losses of million  the allowance for loan losses was million  or of the remaining principal balance  down from the reserve coverage at december  the reduction in the coverage ratio is attributable to the fact that we charged off the fully reserved remaining warehouse lending balance of  in the fourth quarter 
excluding this charge off  the reserve coverage remained relatively constant 
with respect to mortgage loans held for sale  we do not provide an allowance for loan losses  pursuant to the applicable accounting rules 
instead  a component for credit risk related to originations is embedded in the lower of cost or market valuation 
the discount credit reserve on loans held for sale totaled million at december  total credit related reserves  including the allowance for loan losses and lower of cost or market valuations  were million at december  management believes that the allowance for loan losses was adequate at december  the following table provides additional comparative data on non performing assets

table of contents the decrease in non performing loans included in our loans held for sale can be attributed primarily to the sale of delinquent loans during the year 
these loans were sold at prices approximating our carrying value 
mortgage loans held for sale are recorded at estimated fair value and valuations associated with credit exposure are included in the valuation discount and are not included in the allowance for loan losses 
included in the loans held for sale are loans that we have repurchased  which are typically delinquent  in connection with our repurchase responsibilities relating to breaches of standard representations and warranties 
when we repurchase loans  we adjust the basis immediately for any estimated loss upon disposition of the loan  with the offset being recorded to the secondary market reserve 
repurchased loans are classified as held for sale because our strategy is to cure the loan for subsequent sale or sell it as a non performing asset 
interest income for non performing loans of million was received and recognized by us during the year ended december  had the loans performed in accordance with their original terms  million  or an additional million  would have been recognized during the year ended december  we had no loans contractually past due days or more on accrual status during the year ended december  allowance for loan losses a rollforward of the allowance for loan losses follows year december  dollars in thousands loans held for investment core operations balance  beginning of period provision for loan losses charge offs net of recoveries sfr mortgage loans builder mortgage loans consumer construction builder construction charge offs net of recoveries balance  end of period loans held for investment discontinued product lines balance  beginning of period provision for loan losses charge offs net of recoveries balance  end of period total allowance for loan losses net charge offs to average loans net charge offs to annual production core portfolio loans only net charge offs to average loans net charge offs to annual production

the level of our allowance for loan losses is also subject to review by our federal regulators  the ots and the fdic 
these agencies may require that our allowance for loan losses be increased based on their evaluation of the information available to them at the time of their examination of us 
our most recent regulatory examination was completed in october of secondary market reserve we do not sell loans with recourse 
however  we can be required to repurchase loans from investors when our loan sales contain individual loans that are not in conformity with the representations and warranties we make at the time of sale 
we have made significant investments in our post production quality control processes to identify potential systemic issues that could cause repurchases 
we believe that these efforts have improved our production quality 
nonetheless  increases in default rates due to an economic slowdown could cause the overall rate of repurchases to remain constant or even increase 
since inception in january  we have repurchased only a very small amount of loans from its securitization trusts 
the increase in repurchase activity in recent years has been primarily a function of our diversification of our loan sale channels to whole loan and gse sales 
while sales through these channels generate enhanced pricing  they tend to have a greater level of representation and warranty risk 
the following table shows the amount of loans we have repurchased from each channel  since we began active lending operations in january amount percentage repurchased total sold repurchased dollars in millions loans sold to gses and whole loans securitization trusts total we maintain a secondary market reserve for losses that arise in connection with loans that we are required to repurchase from gses and whole loan sales or securitization transactions and for disputes with investors and vendors with respect to contractual obligations pertained to mortgage operation 
additionally  during  we entered into agreements with two mortgage insurance companies to reimburse those companies for any losses incurred on certain portfolios of single family mortgage loans

while the ultimate amount of repurchases and claims is uncertain  management believes that the reserve is adequate 
we will continue to evaluate the adequacy of this reserve and likely will continue to allocate a portion of the gain on sale of loans to the reserve going forward 
the entire balance of the secondary market reserve is included on the consolidated balance sheets as a component of other liabilities

we may repurchase shares in the future at prevailing market prices 
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle during january of  we recognized a million charge to earnings  net of taxes  which was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  in connection with the adoption of emerging issues task force issue no 
recognition of interest income and impairment on certain investments eitf 
this charge was primarily attributable to the non investment grade and residual securities portfolio associated with the discontinued manufactured housing product line 
we discontinued the manufactured housing product line with dealers during  but the portfolio investments that were retained from this product line continued to be impacted by declining trends in the industry 
these securities had previously been marked to market through other accumulated other comprehensive income  a separate component of shareholders equity 
this change resulted in a million reduction to total shareholders equity 
our remaining investment in manufactured housing securities was million at december  
table of contents liquidity and capital resources overview at december   we had operating liquidity of million  which is represented by unpledged liquid assets on hand plus amounts that may be immediately raised through the pledging of other available assets as collateral pursuant to committed lines of credit 
we currently believe that our liquidity level is sufficient to satisfy our operating requirements and to meet our obligations and commitments in a timely and cost effective manner 
principal sources of cash our principal financing needs are to fund acquisitions of mortgage loans and our investment in mortgage loans  mortgage backed securities and msrs 
our primary sources of funds used to meet these financing needs include loan sales and securitizations  deposits  advances from the fhlb of san francisco  borrowings and retained earnings 
the sources used vary depending on such factors as rates paid  collateral requirements  maturities and the impact on our capital 
loan sales and securitizations our business model relies heavily upon selling the majority of our mortgage loans shortly after acquisition 
the proceeds of these sales are a critical component of the liquidity necessary for our ongoing operations 
we sold approximately of our loans to gses during the year ended december  if our sales channels were disrupted  our liquidity would be negatively impacted 
disruptions in the whole loan and mortgage securitization markets can occur as a result of economic events or other factors beyond our control 
deposits consistent with our funding needs  we solicit deposits from the general public and institutions by offering a variety of accounts and rates 
we offer regular savings accounts  demand deposit accounts  money market accounts  certificate of deposit accounts and individual retirement accounts 
deposits totaled billion at december  and billion at december  in addition to its telebanking and internet channels  we offer consumer deposit products through its network of branches in southern california 
upon our acquisition of sgvb in july  it had a nine branch network with a total of million in  deposit accounts 
in november  we opened a branch at our headquarters building in pasadena 
from july  through december   this branch network has grown its deposit base to billion consisting of over  deposit accounts  an increase of in balances and a increase in the number of deposit accounts 
included in deposits at december  and were non interest bearing custodial accounts totaling million and million  respectively 
these balances consist primarily of payments pending remittance to investors on servicing of loans sold to fnma and fhlmc

among other benefits  fhlb membership provides us with a credit facility from which it may borrow  generally on a secured basis  in amounts determined by reference to available collateral 
fhlb stock  one to four unit single family mortgage loans and aaa rated agency mortgage backed securities are the principal collateral that may be used to secure these borrowings  although certain other types of loans and other assets may be accepted pursuant to fhlb policies and statutory requirements 
we have been pre approved for advances up to billion  of which billion were outstanding at december  the fhlb offers several credit programs  each with its own fixed or floating interest rate  and a range of maturities 
trust preferred securities and warrants on november   we completed an offering of warrants and income redeemable equity securities to investors 
gross proceeds of the transaction were million 
the securities were offered as units consisting of a trust preferred security  issued by a trust formed by us  and a warrant to purchase indymac bancorp s common stock 
the proceeds from the offering are used in ongoing operations and will fund future growth and or repurchases of indymac bancorp stock under its share repurchase program see share repurchase activities above 
the balance of trust preferred securities at december  was reclassified from mezzanine debt to liabilities to conform to the current year presentation 
other borrowings other borrowings primarily consist of loans and securities sold under committed agreements to repurchase them 
in addition  we have uncommitted financing against highly liquid us treasury and mortgage backed securities  the balance of which totaled billion at december  total other borrowings increased to billion at december   from billion at december  the increase of billion was used primarily to fund mortgage loans held for sale as these are held on our balance sheet for very short periods of time 
as of december   we had billion in committed financing 
decisions by our lenders and investors to make additional funds available to us in the future will depend upon a number of factors 
these include our compliance with the terms of existing credit arrangements  our financial performance  changes in our credit rating  industry and market trends in our various businesses  the general availability and interest rates applicable to financing and investments  the lenders and or investors own resources and policies concerning loans and investments and the relative attractiveness of alternative investment or lending

our credit facilities do not have default triggers tied to our credit rating with the exception of one facility  which puts our debt on default  if our credit rating is downgraded to b or below 
while a change in rating would thus not directly affect our current borrowing capacity in a material manner  it might affect our lenders decisions to renew credit facilities with us or it may change market perceptions and impact our trading and loan sales activities 

table of contents principal uses of cash in addition to the financing sources discussed above  cash uses are funded by net cash flows from operations  sales of mortgage backed securities and principal and interest payments on loans and securities 
as a financial institution  the lending and borrowing functions are integral parts of our business 
when evaluating our sources and uses of cash  we consider cash used to grow our investments  and the borrowings used to finance those investments  separately from the company s operating cash flows 
our most significant use of cash is for the acquisition of mortgage loans and securities 
in accordance with us gaap  purchases of loans held for sale and trading securities  net of sales of such loans and securities  are required to be included in our consolidated statements of cash flows see page f as a component of net cash used in operating activities  whereas the borrowings used to fund a substantial portion of such loan and securities purchases are required to be recorded in our cash flow statements as a component of net cash provided by financing activities 
the amounts of net purchases of loans held for sale and trading securities included as components of net cash used in operating activities totaled million during and billion during excluding the purchase and sale activity for loans held for sale and trading securities  the net cash provided by the company s operating activities totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
accumulated other comprehensive loss income accumulated other comprehensive loss income aoci was million at december   compared to million at december  this change was a result of the previously described transfer of securities classified as available for sale and the decline in fair value of certain interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges of floating rate borrowings and does not include related decreases in the fair value of borrowings that are hedged by these interest rate swaps 
aoci is not a component of the determination of regulatory capital 
regulatory capital requirements we are subject to regulatory capital regulations administered by the federal banking agencies 
in addition  as a condition to its approval of our acquisition of sgvb in july  the ots mandated we hold tier core capital at of adjusted assets for three years following the consummation of the transaction and maintain a risk based capital position of of risk weighted assets 
additionally  tier risk based capital core capital minus the deduction for low level recourse and residual interests must be equal to at least of risk weighted assets 
we currently meet all of the requirements of a well capitalized institution under the general regulatory capital regulations and also meet the additional requirements of the ots approval condition 
during  the ots issued guidance for subprime lending programs  which requires a lender to quantify the additional risks in its subprime lending activities and determine the appropriate amounts of allowances for loan losses and capital it needs to offset those risks 
the ots guidance suggests that subprime portfolios be supported by capital equal to one and one half to three times greater than what is appropriate for similar prime assets 
the ots has accepted our approach to conform to this guidance  which is based on the secondary market and rating agency securitization models 
we segment the subprime loans into categories based on quantifiable  increasing risk levels 
category i includes all subprime loans with to estimated lifetime loss  category ii includes all subprime loans with to estimated lifetime loss  and category iii includes all subprime loans with greater than estimated lifetime loss 
these categories are risk weighted for capital purposes at   and of the standard risk weighting for the asset type  
table of contents respectively 
we report our subprime loan calculation in an addendum to the thrift financial report that we file with the ots 
the levels and balances within each level were as follows at december  multiple of risk standard risk based december  weighting capital dollars in thousands category i category ii category iii total subprime included in the balance above is million of subprime loans that are held for sale  which are generally not held for more than two quarters prior to sale 
the following table presents our actual and required capital ratios and the minimum required capital ratios to be categorized as well capitalized at december  because not all institutions have uniformly implemented the new subprime guidance  it is possible that our risk based capital ratios will not be comparable to other institutions 
the impact of the additional risk weighting criteria had the effect of reducing our total risk based capital ratio by basis points as noted in the table below 
indymac required capital as reported adjusted for first years pre subprime additional subprime well capitalized through risk weighting risk weighting minimum june  capital ratios tangible tier core tier risk based total risk based the ratios above do not include million of unencumbered cash at indymac bancorp that is available for contribution to our regulatory capital as of december  including the excess capital held by the bank  and such cash  we had million of total excess capital at december  excess capital would increase to million using the well capitalized minimums that we expect to be subject to upon the expiration of our capital requirement on june  described above 
we believe that  under current regulations  we will continue to meet its well capitalized minimum capital requirements in the foreseeable future 
our regulatory capital compliance could be impacted  however  by a number of factors  such as changes to applicable regulations  adverse action by our regulators  changes in the our mix of assets  interest rate fluctuations  loan loss provisions and credit losses  or significant changes in the economy in areas where we have most of our loans 
any of these factors could cause our actual future results to vary from anticipated future results and consequently could have an adverse impact on our ability to meet our future minimum capital requirements 
in light of the fact that we are approaching our three year anniversary as a depository institution and the expiration of our interim capital requirement discussed above  we are in the process of submitting a new five year strategic and financial plan to the regulators with proposed capital requirements on certain items specific to our mortgage banking business model 
see item business regulation and supervision for additional discussion of capital requirements 
aggregate contractual obligations in addition to the financing arrangements discussed above in liquidity and capital resources  we are subject to certain other contractual obligations and contingent commitments to make future payments 
these obligations and commitments expose us to varying degrees of credit and market risk and are subject to the same credit and risk limitation reviews as those recorded on the balance sheet

additionally  in connection with standard representations and warranties on loan sales and securitizations  we are occasionally required to repurchase loans or make certain payments to settle breaches of these representations and warranties 
from inception of our active mortgage banking operations on january  through december   we have sold billion in loans  and repurchased million loans  or of total loans sold 
to provide for probable future losses related to loans sold  we have established a reserve based on estimated losses on actual pending claims and repurchase requests  historical experience  loan sales volume and loan sale distribution channels  which is included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
the balance in this reserve totaled million at december  see the caption secondary market reserve above for further information 
risk factors that may affect future results interest rate risk asset liability management due to the characteristics of our financial assets and liabilities and the nature of our business activities  our liquidity  financial position and results of operations may be materially affected by changes in interest rates in various ways 
the primary objective of our hedging strategies is to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes  on an economic and accounting basis  on the npv of our balance sheet 
secondarily  we hedge to minimize our exposure to volatility in earnings 
we invest in msrs and aaa rated and agency interest only securities to generate core interest income 
the value of these instruments and the income they provide tends to be counter cyclical to the changes in production volumes and gain on sale of loans that result from changes in interest rates 
we also purchase derivative instruments to hedge our mortgage pipeline  msrs and aaa rated and agency interest only securities to guard against losses resulting from increased prepayments in declining interest rate environments 
the overall effectiveness of these hedging strategies is subject to market conditions  the quality of our execution  the accuracy of our asset valuation assumptions and other sources of interest rate risk discussed further below 
mortgage loans held for sale we hedge the risks associated with our mortgage pipeline 
the mortgage pipeline consists of our commitments to purchase mortgage loans rate locks and funded mortgage loans that will be sold in the secondary market 
the risk associated with the mortgage pipeline is that interest rates will fluctuate between the time we commit to purchase a loan at a pre determined price  or the customer locks in the interest rate on a loan  and the time we sell or commit to sell the mortgage loan 
these commitments are recorded net of the anticipated loan funding probability  or fallout factor 
generally speaking  if interest rates increase  the value of an unhedged mortgage pipeline decreases  and gain on sale margins are adversely impacted 
typically  we hedge the risk of overall changes in fair value of loans held for sale by either entering into a forward loan sale agreement or selling forward fnma or fhlmc mbs to hedge loan commitments and to create fair value hedges against the funded loan portfolios 
see further discussion above under the caption loan sales and securitizations in item business 
aaa rated and agency interest only securities and mortgage servicing rights the primary risk associated with aaa rated and agency interest only securities and msrs is that they will lose a substantial portion of their value as a result of higher than anticipated prepayments occasioned by declining interest rates 
conversely  these assets generally increase in value in a rising rate environment 
as of december   we held million of aaa rated and agency interest only securities and million of msrs 
to hedge changes in the value of our aaa rated and agency interest only securities portfolio and msrs  we generally use a combination of several financial instruments  including but not limited to  buying and or selling mortgage backed or us treasury securities  futures  floors  swaps  or options 
in managing the 
table of contents composition of our hedge position we consider a number of factors including  but not limited to  the characteristics of the mortgage loans supporting the hedged assets  market conditions  the cost of alternate hedges and internal and regulatory risk tolerances for interest rate sensitivity 
we use hedging instruments to reduce our exposure to interest rate risk  rather than to speculate on the direction of market interest rates 
these hedging strategies are highly susceptible to prepayment risk  basis risk  market volatility and changes in the shape of the yield curve among other factors as described below 
while our hedging strategies have been generally effective  there can be no assurance that these strategies will succeed under any particular interest rate scenario 
other securities certain financial instruments that we invest in tend to decrease in value as interest rates increase and tend to increase in value as interest rates decline 
these include fixed rate investment grade and non investment grade mortgage backed and asset backed securities  principal only securities and us treasury bonds 
the principal only securities and us treasury bonds generally act as hedges to our servicing related assets 
to a lesser extent  mortgage securities supported by adjustable rate mortgage loans may change in value as interest rates change  if the timing or absolute level of interest rate adjustments on the underlying loans do not correspond to applicable changes in market interest rates 
while such mortgage backed securities are highly rated instruments from a credit standpoint  these securities are considered complex mortgage securities because actual future cash flows may vary from expected cash flows primarily due to borrower prepayment behavior 
sources of interest rate hedging risk we seek to mitigate our interest rate risks through the various hedging strategies described above 
however  there can be no assurance that these strategies including assumptions concerning the correlation thought to exist between different types of instruments or their implementation will be successful in any particular interest rate environment  as market volatility cannot be predicted 
the following are the primary sources of risk that we must manage in our hedging strategies 
basis risk 
in connection with our interest rate risk management  basis risk is most prevalent in our hedging activities  in that the change in value of hedges may not equal or completely offset the change in value of the financial asset or liability being hedged 
while we choose hedges we believe will correlate effectively with the hedged asset or liability under a variety of market conditions  perfect hedges are not available for the assets or liabilities we attempt to hedge 
for example  we hedge our pipeline of non conforming mortgage loans with forward commitments to sell fnma or fhlmc securities of comparable maturities and weighted average interest rates 
however  our non conforming mortgage loans typically trade at a discount or require an incremental yield spread relative to conforming gse collateral  due to the higher perceived ratings of fnma or fhlmc obligations 
in certain interest rate environments  the relative price movement of the non conforming mortgage loans and the agency securities may differ  as the market may require a larger or smaller discount for the non conforming loans 
consequently  the change in value of the non conforming mortgage loan the hedged asset  which is a function of the size of the discount  is typically not perfectly correlated with the change in value of the fnma and fhlmc securities sold the hedge resulting in basis risk 
to hedge our msrs and aaa rated and agency interest only securities  which are primarily backed by non conforming mortgage loan collateral  we use a combination of libor swap based options  treasury and agency futures and private label mortgage backed securities 
as there are no hedge instruments which would be perfectly correlated with these hedged assets  we use the above instruments because we believe they generally correlate well with the hedged assets 
further  we make assumptions in our financial models as to how libor swap  treasury  agency and private label mortgage rates will change in relation to one another 
from time to time  in certain interest rate environments  the relative movement of these different interest rates and the corresponding change in value of the applicable hedge instruments do not change as we anticipate  resulting in an imperfect correlation between the values of the hedges and the hedged assets 

table of contents options risk 
an option provides the holder the right  but not the obligation  to buy  sell  or in some manner alter the cash flows of an instrument or financial contract 
options may be stand alone instruments such as exchange traded options and over the counter contracts  or they may be embedded within standard instruments 
instruments with embedded options include bonds and notes with call or put provisions  loans that give borrowers the right to prepay balances  and adjustable rate loans with interest rate caps or floors that limit the amount by which the rate may adjust 
loans that give borrowers the right to prepay balances present the most significant option risk that we must manage 
repricing risk 
repricing risks arise from the timing difference in the maturity and or repricing of assets  liabilities and off balance sheet positions 
while such repricing mismatches are fundamental to our business  they can expose us to fluctuations in income and economic value as interest rates vary 
for example  if a long term  fixed rate loan is funded with a short term deposit  future net interest income would be susceptible to a decline as interest rates increase 
this decline would occur because the interest income from the loan is fixed  while the interest paid on the deposit will be reset each time the deposit matures 
we monitor and manage repricing risk using npv analyses conforming to regulatory requirements within certain risk tolerances 
this internal risk management process  however  does not eliminate repricing risk 
yield curve risk 
the value of certain loans  securities and hedges we hold is based on a number of factors  including the shape or slope of the appropriate yield curve  as the market values financial assets and hedge instruments based on expectations for interest rates in the future 
yield curves typically reflect the market s expectations for future interest rates 
in valuing our assets and related hedge instruments  in formulating our hedging strategies and in evaluating the interest rate sensitivity for risk management purposes  our models use market yield curves  which are constantly changing 
if the shape or slope of the market yield curves change unexpectedly  the market values of our assets and related hedges may be negatively impacted and or changes in the value of the hedges may not be effectively correlated with the changes in the value of the hedged assets or liabilities 
valuation risk general we hold assets in our investment portfolio that we create in connection with the sale or securitization of mortgage loans 
these assets include aaa rated and agency interest only securities  msrs  non investment grade securities and residuals 
in addition  from time to time  we may acquire these types of securities from third party issuers 
these assets represented of total assets and of total equity at december  we value them with complex financial models that incorporate significant assumptions and judgments  which could vary significantly as market conditions change 
modeling risk we use third party vendor financial models to value each of the asset types referred to above 
these models are complex and use asset specific collateral data and market inputs for interest rates 
while this level of complexity of our valuation models can result in more precise valuations  increased hedging effectiveness and improved risk management practices  the increased complexity must be managed to ensure  among other things  that the models are properly calibrated  the assumptions are reasonable  the mathematical relationships used in the model are predictive and remain so over time  and the data and structure of the assets and hedges being modeled are properly input 
the modeling requirements of msrs and residual securities are significantly more complex than those of aaa rated and agency interest only securities 
this is because of the high number of variables that drive cash flows associated with msrs including  among others  escrow balances  reinvestment rates  defaults and the cost to service mortgage loans and the complex cash flow structures  which may differ on each securitization  that determine the value of residual securities 
to mitigate this risk  we maintain significant internal oversight of the valuation process 
in addition  we have our models or valuations independently assessed by third party specialists 
we will continue to obtain such independent assessments on a periodic basis to address this risk 

table of contents assumption risk even if the general accuracy of the valuation model is validated  valuations are highly dependent upon the reasonableness of our assumptions and the predictability of the relationships which drive the results of the model 
such assumptions are complex as we must make judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
as the number of variables and assumptions affecting the possible future resolution of the uncertainties increases  those judgments become even more complex 
in volatile markets like we experienced in  there is increased risk that our actual results may be significantly different than those results derived from using our assumptions 
as the time period over which the uncertainty will be resolved increases  those estimates will likely change over a greater number of periods  potentially adding further volatility to the model results 
for example  assumptions regarding prepayment speeds and loan loss levels are used in estimating values of certain assets 
if loans prepay faster than estimated  or loan loss levels are higher than anticipated  we may be required to write down the value of such assets 
while we build in discounting factors to our assumptions and implement hedging strategies to mitigate the change in interest rates which drive the change in prepayment rates  asset write downs and write ups typically occur over the lives of the assets 
this occurs because actual prepayments and losses are driven by borrower behavior  which cannot always be precisely predicted 
the above assumptions are just a few examples of assumptions incorporated into our valuations 
whenever active markets exist to provide relevant information  we use third party valuations and related assumptions determined from trading activity or market analysis 
our valuations are also subject to extensive review procedures  including a management level alco  a board of directors level alco and external auditors 
we also validate the overall valuation through third party reviews as discussed above 
further discussion of how we form our assumptions is included under critical accounting policies and judgments below 
credit risk general we have assumed a degree of credit risk in connection with our investments in certain mortgage securities and loans held for investment and sale  as well as in connection with our construction lending operations and our mortgage banking activities 
we have established risk management and credit committees to manage our exposure to credit losses in each of these business operations 
we have also established a central credit risk management committee to monitor the adequacy of loan loss reserves for our lending products and the valuation of credit sensitive securities 
the central credit risk management committee implements changes that seek to balance our credit risk with our production  pricing and profitability goals 
mortgage loans we have two principal underwriting methods designed to be responsive to the needs of our mortgage loan customers traditional underwriting and e mits underwriting 
in  we generated of our mortgage loans through the e mits underwriting process 
through the traditional underwriting method  customers submit mortgage loans that are underwritten by us in accordance with our guidelines prior to purchase 
as discussed above under the caption mortgage banking in item business  e mits is our automated  internet based underwriting and risk based pricing system 
e mits enables us to more accurately estimate expected credit loss  interest rate risk and prepayment risk  so that we can acquire loans at prices that more accurately reflect these risks 
risk based pricing is based on a number of borrower and loan characteristics  including  among other loan variables  credit score  occupancy  documentation type  purpose  loan to value ratio and prepayment assumptions based on an analysis of interest rates 
because our risk based pricing models  including the risk based pricing models utilized in e mits  are based primarily on standard industry loan loss data supplemented by our historical loan loss data and proprietary logic developed by us  and because the models cannot predict the effect of financial market and 
table of contents other economic performance factors  there are no assurances that our risk based pricing models are a complete and accurate reflection of the risks associated with our loan products 
we are also subject to fraud and compliance risk in connection with the purchase or origination of mortgage loans 
fraud risk includes the risk of intentional misstatement of information in property appraisals or other underwriting documentation 
this risk is typically higher in the acquisition of a loan from a third party seller 
compliance risk is the risk that loans are not originated in compliance with applicable laws and regulations  and to our standards 
we mitigate fraud risk through a number of controls including credit checks and reference checks to validate loan quality  and annual recertification of our third party sellers 
we address compliance risk with a quality control program through which we monitor the completeness of loan files throughout several stages of the loan process and identify corrective actions to be taken either by our third party sellers or in house origination staff 
lastly  we perform ongoing quality control reviews to ensure that purchased loans meet our quality standards 
we also have the ability to require our broker or seller counterparties to repurchase loans for representation and warranty breaches 
however  there is no guarantee the broker or seller counterparty will have the financial capability to repurchase the loans 
loan sales and qualifying special purpose entities loan sales and securitization transactions comprise a significant source of our overall funding 
our sales channels include whole loan sales  sales to gses and private label securitizations 
private label securitizations involve transfers of loans to off balance sheet qualifying special purpose entities qspes 
in some transactions  we have retained a relatively small interest in securities issued by the qspes 
pursuant to sfas  accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  the assets and liabilities of the qspes are not consolidated with our financial statements as these entities meet the legal isolation criteria in sfas we retain limited credit exposure from the sale of mortgage loans 
we make standard representations and warranties to the transferee in connection with all such dispositions 
these representations and warranties do not assure against credit risk associated with the transferred loans  but if individual mortgage loans are found not to have fully complied with the associated representations and warranties  we may be required to repurchase the loans from the transferee or we may make payments to settle such breaches of these representations and warranties 
we have established a reserve for losses that arise in connection with representations and warranties for loans sold 
this secondary market reserve is included on the consolidated balance sheets in other liabilities 
we occasionally retain non investment grade securities and residuals that are created in a mortgage loan securitization 
residuals represent the first loss position and are not typically rated by a nationally recognized rating agency 
non investment grade securities rated below bbb may or may not represent the second loss position  depending on the rating  but are typically subject to a disproportionate amount of the credit risk 
see further discussion below under securities portfolio 
see note transfers and servicing of financial assets in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for further disclosure of credit exposure associated with securitizations 
securities portfolio we have assumed a certain degree of credit risk in connection with our investments in investment and non investment grade mortgage backed securities and residual securities 
these securities may be purchased from third party issuers or retained from our own securitization transactions 
in general  non investment grade securities bear losses prior to the more senior investment grade securities 
these securities therefore bear a disproportionate amount of the credit risk with respect to the underlying collateral 
with regard to retained non investment grade and residual securities  a fair value is calculated and assigned to these securities and a this value is reflected in the gain or loss on sale realized from the disposition of the mortgage loans and b the securities are initially reflected at this value on our balance sheet and subsequently adjusted to reflect 
table of contents the changes in fair value 
the ultimate value of the security may be more or less than the initial calculated and assigned value depending upon the credit performance  among other assumptions  of the mortgage loans collateralizing the securities 
the fair value of the security may change from time to time based upon actual default and loss experience of the collateral pool  actual and projected prepayment rates  economic trends and other variables 
our non investment grade securities and residual portfolio of million represented of total assets and of shareholders equity at december  non investment grade securities represent leveraged credit risk as they absorb a disproportionate share of credit risk as compared to investment grade securities 
these securities are recorded on our books net of a discount or valuation allowance that is based upon  among other things  the estimated credit losses  and expected prepayments  as estimated by internal loss models and or perceived by the market  and the coupons  associated with these securities 
our non investment grade securities were recorded at a discount of million to the securities face value and represented of the face value of these securities at december  the adequacy of this discount is dependent upon how accurate our estimate is of both the amount and timing of the cash flows paid to the non investment grade securities  which is primarily based upon our estimate of the amount and timing of credit losses and prepayments on the underlying loan collateral 
residual securities possess a greater degree of risk because they are relatively illiquid  represent the first loss position and require a higher reliance on financial models in determining their fair value 
at december   our investment in residual securities totaled million  which represented of total assets and of total shareholders equity 
realization of this fair value is dependent upon the discount rate used and the accuracy of our estimate of both the amount and timing of the cash flows paid to the residual securities  which are based primarily on our estimate of the amount and timing of credit losses on the underlying loan collateral and to a lesser extent prepayment rates on the underlying loan collateral 
counterparty risk in connection with our trading and hedging activities  we do business only with counterparties that we believe are established and sufficiently capitalized 
in addition  with respect to hedging activities on the pipeline of mortgage loans held for sale  we enter into master netting agreements with an independent clearinghouse known as mbscc 
this entity collects and pays daily margin deposits to reduce the risk associated with counterparty credit quality 
we do not engage in any foreign currency trading 
all interest rate hedge contracts are with entities including their subsidiaries that are approved by a committee of our board of directors and that generally must have a long term credit rating of a or better by one or more nationally recognized credit rating agencies at the time the relevant contract is consummated 
accordingly  we do not believe that we are exposed to more than a nominal amount of counterparty risk associated with our trading and hedging activities 
builder construction loan risk the primary credit risks associated with builder construction lending are underwriting  project risks and market risks 
project risks include cost overruns  borrower credit risk  project completion risk  general contractor credit risk  and environmental and other hazard risks 
market risks are risks associated with the sale of the completed residential units 
they include affordability risk  which is the risk of affordability of financing by borrowers in a rising interest rate environment  product design risk  and risks posed by competing projects 
we attempt to mitigate some of these risks through the management and credit committee review process and utilization of independent experts in the areas of environmental reviews and project market appraisals  however  there can be no assurance that this review process will fully mitigate the foregoing risks 
in our experience  absorption rates of new single family homes have been good in markets served by us 
however  it is unclear whether the economic cycle in certain geographic markets has peaked  which may have an impact on new loan generation or timely payoff of existing loans 
we employ geographic concentration limits and borrower concentration limits for builder construction lending  which are intended to mitigate some of the effects of a slowing economic cycle in some areas 
also  the majority of our builder construction lending commitments have personal or corporate guarantees 

table of contents liquidity risk general our principal financing needs are to fund our acquisition of mortgage loans and our investment in mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities 
our primary sources of funds to meet these financing needs include loan sales and securitizations  deposits  advances from the fhlb  committed borrowings and capital 
our ability to attract and maintain deposits and control our cost of funds has been  and will continue to be  significantly affected by market conditions 
our ability to maintain our borrowing facilities is subject to the renewal of those facilities 
decisions by our lenders and investors to make additional funds available to us in the future will depend upon a number of factors 
these include our compliance with the terms of existing credit arrangements  our financial performance and changes in our credit rating  industry and market trends in our various businesses  the general availability of  and rates applicable to  financing and investments  these lenders and or investors own resources and policies concerning loans and investments  and the relative attractiveness of alternative investment or lending opportunities 
we are in compliance with all debt covenants and other terms of our credit arrangements 
such arrangements include traditional terms and restrictions 
for example  each of our collateralized borrowing facilities permits the lender or lenders thereunder to require us to repay amounts outstanding and or pledge additional assets in the event that the value of the pledged collateral declines due to changes in market interest rates 
at december  we had billion in assets eligible to be pledged as additional collateral in the event that the value of pledged collateral declined 
while there are no guarantees as to the market conditions that may affect our performance  based on current market conditions  we do not expect to fall out of compliance with the terms of our credit arrangements 
loan sales and securitizations our business model relies heavily upon the ability to sell the majority of the mortgage loans that we acquire within a short period after origination 
the proceeds of these sales are a critical component of the liquidity necessary for our ongoing operations 
the key channels through which we sell mortgage loans are bulk sales of loan pools to gses that then securitize the loan pools in their own names  sales on a whole loan basis and the private securitization of loan pools  whereby the loans are sold to securitization trusts 
in  sales to gses were of our total loan sales  whole loan sales were  and private securitizations were  respectively 
we have ready access to all three of these distribution channels at this time  however  a disruption in this access could negatively impact our liquidity position and our ability to execute on our business plan 
the secondary mortgage market is generally a very liquid market with continuing demand for mortgage backed security issuances 
if a temporary disruption to this market did occur  our depository structure provides us with the limited ability to hold mortgage loans on our balance sheet  somewhat mitigating this risk 
in addition  we have substantial liquidity resources million as of december  and the ability to raise additional funding 
however at our current production levels  if the disruption were to last for more than a month or two  we would have to radically restructure our business to slow volume and would have difficulty sustaining our earnings performance as a significant portion of our earnings depend on our ability to sell our mortgage production 
in connection with our private label securitizations  we do not provide contractual legal recourse beyond standard representations and warranties to third party investors that purchase securities issued by the qspes beyond the credit enhancement inherent in any retained subordinated interest ie  retained non investment grade and residual securities 
a deterioration in the performance of our private label securities could adversely impact the availability and pricing of future transactions 

table of contents cyclical industry the mortgage industry is a cyclical business that generally performs better in a low interest rate environment such as the current one 
the environment of historically low interest rates over the past two years has been very favorable for mortgage bankers such as us 
as the industry transitions to a higher interest rate environment  the demand for mortgage loans is expected to decrease  which would cause a lower level of growth  or even a reduction  in earnings per share  in the short run 
in addition  other external factors  including tax laws  the strength of various segments of the economy and demographics of our lending markets  could influence the level of demand for mortgage loans 
gain on sale of loans is a large component of our revenue and would be adversely impacted by a significant decrease in our mortgage loan volume 
we have grown our investment in mortgage loans during to provide a level of core net interest income to somewhat mitigate the cyclicality 
laws and regulations the banking industry in general is extensively regulated at the federal and state levels 
insured depository institutions and their holding companies are subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision by financial regulatory authorities covering all aspects of their organization  management and operations 
the ots and the fdic are primarily responsible for the federal regulation and supervision of the bank and its affiliated entities 
in addition to their regulatory powers  these two agencies also have significant enforcement authority that they can use to address unsafe and unsound banking practices  violations of laws  and capital and operational deficiencies 
enforcement powers can be exercised in a number of ways  through either formal or informal actions 
informal enforcement actions customarily remain confidential between the regulator and the financial institution  while more formal enforcement actions are customarily publicly disclosed 
further  the bank s operations are subject to regulation at the state level  including a variety of consumer protection provisions 
banking institutions also are affected by the various monetary and fiscal policies of the us government  including those of the federal reserve board  and these policies can influence financial regulatory actions 
accordingly  the actions of those governmental authorities responsible for regulatory  fiscal and monetary affairs can have a significant impact on the activities of financial services firms such as ours 
see further information in item business regulation and supervision 
geographic concentration a majority of our loans are geographically concentrated in certain states  including california  new york  florida and new jersey with of our loan receivable balance at december  being in california 
any adverse economic conditions in these markets could cause the number of loans acquired to decrease  likely resulting in a corresponding decline in revenues 
also  we could be adversely affected by business disruptions triggered by natural disasters or acts of war or terrorism in these geographic areas 
business execution and technology risk our business performance is highly dependent on solidly executing our mortgage banking business model 
we must properly price and continue to expand our products  customer base and market share 
in addition  the execution of our hedging activities is critical as we have significant exposure to changes in interest rates 
we are highly dependent on the use of technology in all areas of our business and we must take advantage of advances in technology to stay competitive 
there are no guarantees as to our degree of success in anticipating and taking advantage of technological advances or that we will be more successful in the use of technology than our competitors 
critical accounting policies and judgments several of the critical accounting policies that are very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations require management to make difficult and complex judgments that rely on 
table of contents estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain due to the impact of changing market conditions and or consumer behavior 
we believe our most critical accounting policies relate to assets that are highly dependent on internal valuation models and assumptions rather than market quotations  including  aaa rated and agency interest only securities  msrs and non investment grade securities and residuals  our allowance for loan losses all and our secondary market reserve 
with the exception of the all  these items are generally created in connection with our loan sale and securitization process 
the allocated cost of the retained assets at the time of the sale is recorded as a component of the net gain on sale of loans 
we recognized a total of million in gain on sale of loans during the year ended december  a component of this gain was million of fair value of such retained assets 
such retained assets were comprised primarily of msrs and  to a much lesser degree  aaa rated and agency interest only securities and investment grade securities and residual securities 
there is a risk that at times we might not satisfy the requirements for fair value hedge accounting under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  for a portion of our loans held for sale because we do not meet the required complex hedge correlation tests 
this could cause temporary fluctuations in our reported income but not in the ultimate economic results 
the fluctuation in our reported income if hedge accounting is not achieved would be over a very short period as we sell our loans on average in days and the economic effect of both the hedges and loans would be recorded once the sale was completed 
in addition  any imprecision in valuation of these items would be adjusted and recorded in a short period through our gain on sale margin once the sale of the loans was completed 
fair values for these assets are determined by using available market information  historical performance of the assets underlying collateral and internal valuation models as appropriate 
the reasonableness of fair values will vary depending upon the availability of third party market information  which is a function of the market liquidity of the asset being valued 
in connection with our mortgage banking and investment portfolio operations  we invest in assets created from the loan sale and securitization process  for which markets are relatively limited and illiquid 
as a result  the valuation of these assets is subject to our assumptions about future events rather than market quotations 
these assets include aaa rated and agency interest only securities  msrs  non investment grade securities and residuals 
as the number of variables and assumptions used to estimate fair value increases and as the time period increases over which the estimates are made  such estimates will likely change in a greater number of periods  potentially adding volatility to our valuations and financial results 
aaa rated and agency interest only securities aaa rated interest only securities are created upon the sale of loans through private label securitizations or  to a much lesser degree  purchased from third party issuers 
agency interest only securities are created through the bifurcation of the servicing fee we retain to service loans sold to one of the gse 
under the agreement with the gse  the contractual servicing fee is separated into a base servicing fee of basis points the base servicing fee and an excess yield certificate agency interest only security for amounts above the base servicing fee 
the cash flows from the excess yield certificate are not dependent upon the continued servicing of the underlying loans by us 
the asset value of aaa rated and agency interest only securities represents the present value of the estimated future cash flows to be received from the excess spread 
future cash flows are estimated by taking the coupon rate of the loans collateralizing the transaction less the interest rate coupon paid to the investors less contractually specified servicing and trustee fees  after giving effect to estimated prepayments of the underlying loans 
the aaa rating of the interest only securities reflects the fact that they are exposed to very low credit risk  but does not reflect the fact that their interest rate risk can be significant 
the agency interest only securities are not rated but management believes that these assets would be rated aaa if rated due to the nature of the collateral 
we classify our aaa rated and agency interest only securities as trading and they are therefore carried at fair value  with changes in fair value being recorded through earnings 
valuation changes  net of related hedge gains and losses  are included in gain on mortgage backed securities  net in the consolidated statements of earnings 
we use third party models and an option adjusted spread oas valuation methodology to value 
table of contents these securities 
the key assumptions include prepayment rates based on collateral type and the option adjusted spreads 
based on these assumptions  our model calculates implied discount rates  which we compare to market discount rates and risk premiums to determine if our valuations are reasonable 
in addition to considering actual prepayment trends  prepayment rates are determined utilizing four factor prepayment models 
these factors are relative coupon rate 
the interest rate the borrower is currently paying relative to current market rates for that type of loan is the primary predictor of the borrower s likelihood to prepay 
we assume that a borrower s propensity to prepay increases as the amount by which the borrower s loan rate exceeds the current market rates increases 
seasoning 
based on prepayment curves psa and other studies performed by industry analysts of prepayment activity over the life of a pool of loans  a pattern has been identified whereby prepayments typically peak in years to  consistent with borrower moving habits 
seasonality 
seasonality refers to the time of the year that prepayments occur 
all else being constant  prepayments tend to be higher in summer months due to borrowers tendency to move outside of the school year and lower in winter months due to the holiday season 
burn out 
burn out is associated with a pool of mortgage loans which has endured a variety of high prepayment environments such that it may be assumed that the remaining borrowers are insensitive to any subsequent decline in interest rates 
consequently  all else being equal  projected prepayment speeds for such a pool of loans would be lower than a newly originated loan pool with comparable characteristics 
as cash flows must be estimated over the life of the pool of mortgage loans underlying the aaa rated and agency interest only securities  assumptions must be made about the level of interest rates over that same time horizon  which is primarily years  as these securities have a weighted average life of approximately that period 
we utilize a credit spread over the market libor swap forward curve to estimate the level of mortgage interest rates over the life of the pool of loans 
we believe a forward curve  as opposed to static or spot interest rates  incorporates the market perception about expected changes in interest rates and provides a more realistic estimate of lifetime interest rates and therefore prepayment rates 
as of december   the libor swap forward curve was upward sloping over a three to five year period  which results in our estimate of prepayment rates decreasing over the life of the loans 
the discount rate represents the implicit yield a knowledgeable investor would require to purchase or own the projected cash flows 
using an oas model  embedded options and other cash flow uncertainties are quantified across a large number of hypothetical interest rate environments 
the oas is essentially the credit spread over the risk free rate after the option costs eg  hedge costs are considered 
overall  we evaluate the reasonableness of the discount rate based on the spread over the risk free rate duration adjusted libor securities relative to other cash flow sensitive investments with higher and lower risk profiles 
mortgage servicing rights msrs are created upon the sale of loans to gses  in private label securitizations  and occasionally  from the sale of whole loans 
we also purchase msrs from time to time from third parties 
the carrying value of msrs in our financial statements represents our estimate of the present value of future cash flows to be received by us as servicer of the loans 
in general  future cash flows are estimated by projecting the service fee  plus late fees and reinvestment income associated with interest earned on float  after subtracting guarantee fees on agency portfolios  the cost of reimbursing investors for compensating interest associated with the early pay off of loans  the market cost to service the loans  and the cost of mortgage insurance premiums if applicable  and after giving effect to estimated prepayments 
msrs are recorded at the lower of amortized cost or fair value with valuation changes  net of hedges  being reported in service fee income in the consolidated statements of earnings 
we use a third party valuation model and a combination of oas and static discount rate methodologies to value these assets 
we use static 
table of contents models on collateral types such as arm and subprime loans because we believe they are more appropriately valued using this methodology  as prepayments on these collateral types are less dependent on interest rate changes 
the key assumptions include prepayment rates and  to a lesser degree  reinvestment income and discount rates 
prepayment speeds and oas derived discount rates are determined using the methodology described above for aaa rated and agency interest only securities 
reinvestment income represents the interest earned on custodial balances the float 
custodial balances are generated from the collection of borrower principal and interest and escrow balances which we generally hold on deposit for a short period until the required monthly remittance of such funds to a trustee 
reinvestment income is reduced by compensating interest  or interest short  which we must pay to investors to compensate for interest lost on the early payoff of loans under the terms of the related pooling and servicing agreements 
our estimate of reinvestment income is a function of float  which is derived from our estimate of prepayment speeds  and an estimate of the interest rate we will earn by temporarily investing these balances 
the reinvestment rate is typically based on the federal funds rate  and we factor in the market forward curve to derive a long term estimate 
the valuation of msrs includes numerous assumptions of varying lower sensitivities in addition to the assumptions discussed above 
for example  other assumptions include  but are not limited to  market cost to service loans  prepayment penalties  delinquencies and the related late fees and escrow balances 
we believe our valuation of msrs as of december  was reasonable given market conditions at december  and periodic third party valuations obtained from servicing brokers 
in february  the federal banking regulatory agencies  including the ots and fdic who are the bank s primary regulatory authorities  issued an advisory on mortgage banking activities primarily in the valuation and hedging of msrs 
in this advisory  the regulatory authorities provide guidance on the valuation of msrs including the determination and documentation of assumptions  comparison to market data  stratification of msrs for impairment testing  appropriate amortization of the cost basis of msrs  review of actual cash flow performance  periodic review of the models used to value msrs  recognition of permanent impairment and proper risk management procedures including review and approval of the valuation and assumptions by management and reporting to the board of directors 
they also provide guidance about hedging activities including measuring and controlling the interest rate risk of msrs  approval of hedging products and strategies and documentation related to hedges and to hedge accounting 
we believe we have a thorough and comprehensive process related to the valuation and hedging of msrs including review of the valuation and assumptions and review of the hedging strategy and hedge performance by a committee of our management level asset liability committee and reporting of such items to a committee of our board of directors 
as msrs are valued based on our determination of assumptions about the future and using complex models  we could be subject to enhanced scrutiny and criticism of our valuation of msrs from our regulatory authorities 
non investment grade securities and residuals general non investment grade securities and residuals are created upon the issuance of private label securitizations and to a small extent purchased from third parties 
non investment grade securities rated below bbb represent leveraged credit risk as they typically absorb a disproportionate amount of credit losses before such losses affect senior or other investment grade securities 
residuals represent the first loss position and are not typically rated by the nationally recognized agencies 
the asset value of residuals represents the present value of future cash flows expected to be received by us from the excess cash flows created in the securitization transaction 
in general  future cash flows are estimated by taking the coupon rate of the loans underlying the transaction less the interest rate paid to the investors  less contractually specified servicing and trustee fees  and after giving effect to estimated prepayments and credit losses 
cash flows are also dependent upon various restrictions and conditions specified in each transaction 
for example  typically residual securities are not entitled to any cash flows unless an over collateralization 
table of contents oc account has reached a certain level 
the oc in an account represents the difference between the bond balance and the collateral underlying the security 
a sample oc structure may require of the original collateral balance for months 
at month  it may require  but on a declining balance basis 
due to prepayments  that requirement is generally less than the required on the original balance 
in addition  the transaction may include an oc trigger event  the occurrence of which may require the oc to be increased 
an example of such a trigger event is delinquency rates or cumulative losses on the underlying collateral that exceed stated levels 
if oc targets were not met  the trustee would hold all cash flows that would otherwise flow to the residual security until such targets are met 
a delay or reduction in the cash flows received will result in a lower valuation of the residual 
we consider certain of our investment grade securities to be hedges of our aaa rated and agency interest only securities and residual securities 
we therefore classify them as trading securities in order to reflect changes in their fair values in our current income 
residual securities are also classified as trading securities so that the accounting for these securities will mirror the economic hedging activities 
all other mortgage backed securities  including the majority of our non investment grade securities  are classified as available for sale 
at least quarterly  we evaluate the carrying value of non investment grade and residual securities in light of the actual performance of the underlying loans 
if fair value is less than amortized cost and the estimated undiscounted cash flows have decreased compared to the prior period  the impairment is recorded through earnings 
we classify our non investment grade residuals as trading and therefore record them at our estimate of their fair value  with changes in fair value being recorded through earnings 
we use a third party model  using the cash out method to value these securities 
this method reflects when we receive the cash  which may be later than when the trust receives the cash 
the model takes into consideration the cash flow structure specific to each transaction such as over collateralization requirements and trigger events 
the key valuation assumptions include credit losses  prepayment rates and  to a lesser degree  discount rates 
loss estimates we use a proprietary loss estimation model to project credit losses 
this model was developed utilizing our actual loss experience for prime and subprime loans 
the modeling logic has been reviewed by a third party specialist in this area and validated 
the expected loan loss is a function of loan amount  conditional default probability and projected loss severity 
characteristics that impact default probability vary depending on loan type and current delinquency status  but generally include the borrower s credit score  loan to value ratio  loan amount  debt to income ratio and loan purpose  among other variables 
characteristics that impact loss severity includes unpaid principal balance  loan to value  days to liquidation  mortgage insurance status  cash out versus no cash out financing and primary residence status 
the loss estimation model also includes conditional default curves  which relate to the expected timing of the estimated loss 
in our experience  default probabilities generally reach a peak within two to three years of loan origination and become less likely after four to five years 
while there can be no assurance as to the accuracy of the model in predicting losses  we and a third party specialist have back tested our model and have validated the model s default probability logic 
the model is updated and recalibrated periodically based on our on going actual loss experience 
prepayment speeds we estimate prepayments on a collateral specific basis and consider actual prepayment activity for the collateral pool 
we also consider the current interest rate environment  the market forward curve projections and prepayments estimated on similar collateral pools where we own msrs 
increasing prepayments tend to benefit the valuation of non investment grade securities as the projected loss gets reduced due to the shorter loan life 
however  increasing prepayments may reduce the value of residual securities since these securities represent excess spread on the underlying collateral 
higher prepayments reduce the life of the residual and total cash flows resulting in a reduction in the fair value of the residual 

table of contents discount rates we determine static discount rates based on a number of factors  including but not limited to the collateral type and quality  structure of the transaction  market interest rates and our ability to generate an appropriate after tax return on equity given the other valuation assumptions and resulting projected cash flows 
we also review the discount rates used by other investors for similar securities to evaluate the appropriateness of our assumptions 
as non investment grade securities and residuals are our highest risk profile assets  and liquidity is generally the lowest for these assets on a duration adjusted basis  the spread over the risk free rate is also the highest of all of our cash flow sensitive assets 
allowance for loan losses we utilize several methodologies to estimate the adequacy of our all and to ensure that the allocation of the all to the various portfolios is reasonable given current trends and the economic outlook 
in this regard  we segregate assets into homogeneous pools of loans and heterogeneous loans 
homogeneous pools of loans exhibit similar characteristics and  as such  can be evaluated as pools of assets through the assessment of default probabilities and corresponding loss severities 
our homogeneous pools include residential mortgage loans  manufactured home loans and home improvement loans 
the estimate of the allowance for loan losses for homogeneous pools is based on expected inherent losses resulting from four methodologies internal loan loss estimation model this model estimates losses based on several key loan characteristics 
for further discussion regarding this model  see the previous section entitled non investment grade securities and residuals loss estimates 
portfolio level delinquency migration analysis this analysis produces a range of projected losses based on current loss severities and the preceding months of migration rates of delinquent loans into non performing loans 
delinquency trend analysis this analysis provides the basis for estimating the direction of npa and loss severity levels into future periods 
historical loss analysis this analysis compares the level of allowance to the historical losses actually incurred in prior years 
our builder construction loans generally carry higher balances and involve unique loan characteristics that cannot be evaluated solely through the use of default rates  loss severities and trend analysis 
to estimate an appropriate level of all for our heterogeneous loans  we constantly screen the portfolios on an individual asset basis to classify problem credits and to estimate potential loss exposure 
in this estimation  we determine the level of adversely classified assets using the classification criteria described below in a portfolio and the related loss potential and extrapolate the weighting of those two factors across all assets in the portfolio 
our asset classification methodology was designed in accordance with guidelines established by our supervisory regulatory agencies as follows pass assets classified pass are assets that are well protected by the net worth and paying capacity of the borrower or by the value of the asset or underlying collateral 
special mention special mention assets have potential weaknesses that require close attention  but have not yet jeopardized the timely repayment of the asset in full 
substandard this is the first level of adverse classification 
assets in this category are inadequately protected by the net worth and paying capacity of the borrower or by the value of the collateral 
substandard assets are characterized by the distinct possibility that some loss will occur if the deficiencies are not corrected 

table of contents doubtful assets in this category have the same weaknesses as a substandard asset  with the added characteristic that based on current facts  conditions and values  liquidation of the asset in full is highly improbable 
loss assets in the loss category are considered uncollectible and of such little value that the continuance as an asset  without establishment of a specific valuation allowance  is not warranted 
secondary market reserve as part of the normal course of business involving loans sold to the secondary market  we are occasionally required to repurchase loans or make payments to settle breaches of the standard representations and warranties made as part of our loan sales or securitizations 
the secondary market reserve includes probable losses on repurchases arising from representation and warranty claims  and probable obligations related to disputes with investors and vendors with respect to contractual obligations pertaining to mortgage origination activity 
the reserve level is a function of expected losses based on actual pending claims and repurchase requests  historical experience  loan volume and loan sales distribution channels and the assessment of probable vendor or investor claims 
an increase to this reserve is recorded as a reduction of the gain on sale of loans in our consolidated statements of earnings and the corresponding reserve is recorded in other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
at the time we repurchase a loan  the estimated loss on the loan is charged against this reserve and recorded as a reduction of the basis of the loan 
sensitivity analysis changing the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of aaa rated and agency interest only securities  msrs and non investment grade securities and residuals the retained assets could materially impact the amount recorded in gain on sale of loans 
initially  the estimation of the fair value of the retained assets from loan securitizations and sales impacts the financial statements of our mortgage banking segment 
thereafter  adjustments to fair value impact the investment portfolio s financial statements 
provisions to the secondary market reserve impact the mortgage bank  while adjustments to the all may impact either the mortgage bank or the investment portfolio segments 
refer to note transfers and servicing of financial assets in the consolidated financial statements of indymac for further information on the hypothetical effect on the fair value of our retained assets using various unfavorable variations of the expected levels of certain key assumptions used in valuing these assets at december  future earnings outlook on average  us mortgage debt outstanding has grown approximately to per year over the last twenty years and is projected  based on economic demographics  to continue this level of growth over the next decade 
the annual amounts of mortgage industry production volumes can vary significantly from year to year depending on the levels of interest rates and refinancing transactions 
at this rate  mortgage debt outstanding roughly doubles every decade 
since the inception of our operating business plan years ago in january  we have grown earnings at a compounded annual growth rate of and earnings per share at a compounded annual growth rate of 
for  we expect that earnings per share will range from levels near the earnings per share of at the low end to an increase of at the high end 
our range for incorporates the current forecast by the mortgage bankers association of america for a decline in mortgage industry production in as the historic refinance volumes of begins to abate  marking the beginning of an expected mortgage market transition 
we expect  however  that our intermediate term growth rate will approximate  as we have historically gained market share in periods when the overall market is flat or down 
no assurance can be given that we will achieve the historical or projected earnings growth rate  as we are subject to certain risks and uncertainties  as noted above in key operating risks and risk factors that may affect future results 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the primary market risk to which we are exposed is interest rate risk  including fluctuations in short and long term interest rates 
an additional risk is the early prepayment of loans held for investment  mbs and mortgage loans underlying our msrs  aaa rated and agency interest only securities and residuals 
investment portfolio is responsible for the management of interest rate and prepayment risks subject to policies and procedures established by our management level alco and board of directors level alco 
see item business risk factors that may affect future results for further discussion of risks 
hedging activities we utilize a variety of means in order to manage interest rate risk 
we invest in msrs and aaa rated and agency interest only securities to generate core interest and fee income 
the value of these instruments and the income they provide tends to be counter cyclical to the changes in production volumes and gain on sale of loans that result from changes in interest rates 
with regard to the pipeline of mortgage loans held for sale  in general  we hedge this asset with a forward commitment to sell a fnma or fhlmc security of comparable maturity and weighted average interest rate 
to hedge our investments in aaa rated and agency interest only securities and msrs  we use several strategies  including buying and or selling mortgage backed or us treasury securities  futures  floors  swaps  or options  depending on several factors 
lastly  we enter into swap agreements and utilize fhlb advances to mitigate interest rate risk on mortgage loans held for investment 
in connection with all of the above strategies  we use hedging instruments to reduce our exposure to interest rate risk  not to speculate on the direction of market interest rates 
monitoring tools our management level and board of directors level alco members closely monitor interest rate risk 
the primary measurement tool used to evaluate risk is an npv analysis 
an npv analysis simulates the effects of an instantaneous and sustained change in interest rates in a variety of basis point increments to parallel interest rate shifts  on our assets and liabilities  commitments and hedges 
the result is an estimate of the increase or decrease to net portfolio value 
see item management s discussion and analysis overall interest rate risk management for a further discussion of our npv analysis
