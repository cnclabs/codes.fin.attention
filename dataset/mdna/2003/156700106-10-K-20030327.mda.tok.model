internal access lines declined and during and  respectively 
internal access line growth during was 
the company believes the decline in the number of access lines during and is primarily due to declines in second lines  soft general economic conditions in the company s markets and the displacement of traditional wireline telephone services by other competitive service providers

accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations sfas and sfas sfas requires all business combinations consummated after june  to be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting  the pooling of interests method is no longer permitted 
the company adopted sfas on july  sfas requires goodwill recorded in a business combination to be reviewed for impairment at least annually and to be written down only in periods in which the recorded amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value 
effective january   systematic amortization of goodwill is no longer permitted 
the company adopted sfas effective january  in october  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and also broadens the reporting of discontinued operations to include all components of an entity with operations that can be distinguished from the rest of the entity and that will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity in a disposal transaction 
the company adopted the provisions of sfas on january  the company s wireless operations have been reflected as discontinued operations for in accordance with the provisions of sfas results of operations for and have been restated to conform to this presentation 
the adoption of the impairment portion of sfas did not have a material effect on the results of operations of the company 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas 
sfas  effective beginning january   addresses financial accounting and reporting for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred and be capitalized as part of the book value of the long lived asset 
although the company generally has had no legal obligation to remove assets  depreciation rates of certain assets established by regulatory authorities for the company s telephone operations subject to sfas have historically included a component for removal costs in excess of the related estimated salvage value 
sfas requires the company to not remove this accumulated liability for removal costs in excess of salvage value even though there is no legal obligation to remove the assets 
for the company s telephone operations not subject to sfas the properties acquired from verizon in and its other operations  the company has not accrued a liability for anticipated removal costs in the past and will continue to expense the costs of removal as incurred since there is no legal obligation to remove assets 
the company does not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material effect on its financial statements 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
sfas  effective for fiscal years ending after december   amends statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation 
in addition  sfas amends the disclosure requirements of sfas to require prominent disclosure in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the company has elected to account for employee stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  as allowed by sfas critical accounting policies the company s financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
management continually evaluates its estimates and judgments including those related to i revenue recognition  ii allowance for doubtful accounts  iii purchase price allocation  iv pension and postretirement benefits and v long lived assets 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity 
revenue recognition 
certain of the company s telephone subsidiaries participate in revenue sharing arrangements with other telephone companies for interstate revenue and for certain intrastate revenue 
under such sharing arrangements  which are typically administered by quasi governmental agencies  participating telephone companies contribute toll revenue or access charges within state jurisdictions and access charges in the interstate market 
these revenues are pooled by the administrative agencies and used to reimburse exchange carriers for their costs 
typically  participating companies have months to update or correct data previously submitted 
as a result  revenues earned through the various sharing arrangements are initially recorded based on the company s estimates 
historically  revisions of previous revenue estimates have not been material 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
in evaluating the collectibility of its accounts receivable  the company assesses a number of factors  including a specific customer s or carrier s ability to meet its financial obligations to the company  the length of time the receivable has been past due and historical collection experience 
based on these assessments  the company records both specific and general reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable to reduce the related accounts receivable to the amount the company ultimately expects to collect from customers and carriers 
if circumstances change or economic conditions worsen such that the company s past collection experience is no longer relevant  the company s estimate of the recoverability of its accounts receivable could be further reduced from the levels reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
purchase price allocation 
for the properties acquired from verizon in  the company allocated the aggregate purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on fair value at the date of acquisition 
the fair value of property  plant and equipment and identifiable intangible assets was determined by an independent appraisal of such assets 
the fair value of the postretirement benefit obligation was determined through actuarial valuations 
the fair value of current assets and current liabilities was assumed to approximate the recorded value at acquisition due to their short maturity 
the remaining unallocated acquisition cost was considered goodwill 
pension and postretirement benefits 
the amounts recognized in the financial statements related to pension and postretirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis  which utilizes many assumptions in the calculation of such amounts 
a significant assumption used in determining the company s pension and postretirement expense is the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
for  such expected return was assumed to range between  with being used on the plans with the greatest amount of assets 
for the past several years  our actual return on plan assets has been significantly lower than the range 
for  the company lowered its expected long term rate of return on plan assets to range from  reflecting the expected moderation of long term rates of return in the financial markets 
another assumption used in the determination of the company s pension and postretirement benefit plan obligations is the appropriate discount rate  which is generally based on the yield on high quality corporate bonds 
the company lowered its assumed discount rate to at december  from at december  changes in the discount rate do not have a material impact on the company s results of operations 
see pension and medical costs for additional information 
long lived assets 
effective january   the company was subject to test for impairment of long lived assets under two new accounting standards  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  and sfas sfas requires goodwill recorded in business combinations to be reviewed for impairment and requires write downs only in periods in which the recorded amount of goodwill exceeds the fair value 
under sfas  impairment of goodwill is tested by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill 
estimates of the fair value of the reporting unit are based on valuation models using techniques such as multiples of earnings 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value  a second calculation is required in which the implied fair value of goodwill is compared to its carrying value 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value  goodwill must be written down to its implied fair value 
the company completed the initial transitional goodwill impairment test as of january  as well as the required annual test as of september  of sfas and has determined its goodwill is not impaired 
prior to january   substantially all of the company s goodwill was amortized over years 
the company s amortization of goodwill for the years ended december  and totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
under sfas  the carrying value of long lived assets other than goodwill is reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that such carrying amount cannot be recoverable by assessing the recoverability of the carrying value through estimated undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets 
if the undiscounted net cash flows are less than the carrying value  an impairment loss would be measured as the excess of the carrying value of a long lived asset over its fair value 
for additional information on the company s critical accounting policies  see accounting pronouncements and regulation and competition other matters  and the footnotes to the company s consolidated financial statements 
inflation the effects of increased costs historically have been mitigated by the company s ability to recover certain costs applicable to its regulated telephone operations through the rate making process 
while the rate making process does not permit the company to immediately recover the costs of replacing its physical plant  the company has historically been able to recapture these costs over time 
possible future regulatory changes may alter the company s ability to recover increased costs in its regulated operations 
for the properties acquired from verizon in  which are regulated under price cap regulation for interstate purposes  price changes are limited to the rate of inflation  minus a productivity offset 
for additional information regarding the current regulatory environment  see regulation and competition 
as operating expenses in the company s nonregulated lines of business increase as a result of inflation  the company  to the extent permitted by competition  attempts to recover the costs by increasing prices for its services and equipment 
market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on its long term debt obligations 
the company has estimated its market risk using sensitivity analysis 
market risk is defined as the potential change in the fair value of a fixed rate debt obligation due to a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates 
fair value on long term debt obligations is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis  using the rates and maturities of these obligations compared to terms and rates currently available in the long term markets 
the results of the sensitivity analysis used to estimate market risk are presented below  although the actual results may differ from these estimates 
at december   the fair value of the company s long term debt was estimated to be billion based on the overall weighted average rate of the company s long term debt of and an overall weighted maturity of years compared to terms and rates currently available in long term financing markets 
with respect to the company s fixed rate long term debt obligations  market risk is estimated as the potential decrease in fair value of the company s fixed rate long term debt resulting from a hypothetical increase of basis points in interest rates ten percent of the company s overall weighted average borrowing rate 
such an increase in interest rates would result in approximately a million decrease in fair value of the company s long term debt

at december   the company had outstanding a fair value interest rate hedge associated with million aggregate principal amount of its series h senior notes  due  that pays interest at a fixed rate of 
this hedge is a fixed to variable interest rate swap that effectively converts the company s fixed rate interest payment obligations under these notes into obligations to pay variable rates equal to the six month london interbank offered rate libor plus with settlement and rate reset dates occurring each six months through the expiration of the hedge in october at december   the company realized a rate under this hedge of 
interest expense was reduced by million in as a result of this hedge 
the fair market value of this hedge was million at december  and is reflected as an asset and as an adjustment to the underlying debt on the december  balance sheet 
with respect to this hedge  market risk is estimated as the potential change in the fair value of the hedge resulting from a hypothetical increase in the forward rates used to determine the fair value 
a hypothetical increase in the forward rates would result in a million decrease in the fair value of this hedge 
at december   the company also had outstanding a cash flow hedge associated with million of borrowings under its million credit facilities 
such hedge expires in october this hedge is designed to swap the company s future obligation to pay variable rate interest based on libor into obligations that lock in a fixed rate of 
the fair value of this hedge was million at december  and is reflected as a liability and accumulated other comprehensive loss net of tax on the december  balance sheet 
a hypothetical increase in the forward rates would result in a  decrease in the fair value liability of this hedge 
development of billing system the company is in the process of developing an integrated billing and customer care system 
the costs to develop such system have been capitalized in accordance with statement of position  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  and aggregated million at december  a portion of these billing system costs related to the wireless business million was written off as a component of discontinued operations in the third quarter of as a result of the sale of substantially all of the company s wireless operations on august  see note to the company s consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report 
excluding this write off  the company s aggregate billing system costs are expected to approximate million upon completion and are expected to be amortized over a twenty year period 
the company expects to begin amortization of the billing system in as customer groups are migrated to this new system 
in addition  the company expects to incur duplicative system costs in until such time as all customers are migrated to the new system 
such amortization and duplicative system costs are expected to reduce diluted earnings per share by 
for the system remains in the development stage and has required substantially more time and money to develop than originally anticipated 
although the company expects to complete all phases of the system in early  there is no assurance that this deadline or the company s budget will be met or that the system will function as anticipated 
if the system does not function as anticipated  the company may have to write off part or all of its remaining costs 
pension and medical costs the decline in equity markets in recent years  coupled with record low interest rates and rising medical costs  have increased the company s employee benefits expenses  including defined benefit pension expenses and pre and post retirement medical expenses

these changes may have a significant impact on the future financial performance of all communications companies 
events affecting the communications industry 
in  the united states congress enacted the telecommunications act of the act  which obligates lecs to permit competitors to interconnect their facilities to the lec s network and to take various other steps that are designed to promote competition 
the act provides certain exemptions for rural lecs such as those operated by the company 
under the act s rural telephone company exemption  approximately of the company s telephone access lines are exempt from certain of these interconnection requirements unless and until the appropriate state regulatory commission overrides the exemption upon receipt from a competitor of a bona fide request meeting certain criteria 
on february   the fcc revised its rules outlining the obligations of incumbent lecs to lease elements of their networks on an unbundled basis to competitors 
the new framework eliminates the prior obligation of incumbent lecs to lease their high speed data lines to competitors 
incumbent lecs will remain obligated to offer other telecommunications services to resellers at wholesale rates 
this new rule also provides for a significant role of state regulatory commissions in implementing these new guidelines and establishing wholesale service rates 
prior to and since the enactment of the act  the fcc and a number of state legislative and regulatory bodies have also taken steps to foster local exchange competition 
coincident with this recent movement toward increased competition has been the gradual reduction of regulatory oversight of lecs 
these cumulative changes have led to the continued growth of various companies providing services that compete with lecs services 
wireless services entities also increasingly constitute a significant source of competition with lecs 
as mandated by the act  in may the fcc modified its existing universal service support mechanism for rural telephone companies 
the fcc adopted an interim mechanism for a five year period  effective july   based on embedded  or historical  costs that will provide predictable levels of support to rural local exchange carriers  including substantially all of the company s local exchange carriers 
during the company s interstate revenues from the federal universal service fund totaled approximately million which includes million from the verizon properties acquired in 
during and  such revenues totaled million and million  respectively 
increasingly  wireless carriers have sought and received payments from the universal service fund  which the company believes is currently enhancing their ability to compete with wireline services and  in the long term  could adversely impact the amount of funding available for lecs 
on october   the fcc modified its interstate access charge rules and universal service support system for rate of return local exchange carriers  which includes the company s local exchange carriers excluding the properties acquired from verizon in 
this order  among other things  i increased the caps on the subscriber line charges slc to the levels paid by most subscribers nationwide  ii allowed limited slc deaveraging  which is expected to enhance the competitiveness of rate of return carriers by giving them pricing flexibility  iii lowered per minute rates collected for federal access charges  which might increase competition with centurytel s long distance operations to the extent other carriers seek to take advantage of this change  iv created a new explicit universal service support mechanism that will replace other implicit support mechanisms in a manner designed to ensure that rate structure changes do not affect the overall recovery of interstate access costs by rate of return carriers serving high cost areas and v terminated the fcc s proceeding on the represcription of the authorized rate of return for rate of return lecs  which will remain at 
the effect of this order on the company was revenue neutral for interstate purposes  however  intrastate revenues were adversely effected in arkansas and ohio as the intrastate access rates in these states mirror the interstate access rates 
recent events affecting the company 
during the last few years  several states in which the company has substantial operations took legislative or regulatory steps to further introduce competition into the lec business 
the number of companies which have requested authorization to provide local exchange service in the company s service areas has increased in recent years  especially in the markets acquired from verizon in and  and it is anticipated that similar action may be taken by others in the future 
state alternative regulation plans recently adopted by certain of the company s lecs have also affected revenue growth recently 
certain long distance carriers continue to request that the company reduce intrastate access tariffed rates for certain of its lecs 
in addition  the company has recently experienced reductions in intrastate traffic  partially due to the displacement of minutes by wireless services 
in the company incurred a reduction in its intrastate revenues exclusive of the properties acquired from verizon in of approximately million compared to primarily due to these factors 
the company believes such trend of decreased intrastate minutes will continue in although the magnitude of such decrease cannot be precisely estimated  the company believes such decrease will be less than that incurred in in august  the company was awarded an interim access rate increase by the wisconsin public service commission wpsc for the former verizon properties in wisconsin in an amount of approximately million annually 
in october  the company was awarded a permanent rate increase which will result in an additional to million annually above the million awarded on an interim basis 
on august   the wisconsin court of appeals upheld a ruling upon appeal that ordered the company to refund intrastate access charges collected from interexchange carriers from december through december on the wisconsin properties acquired from ameritech in december as a result of this ruling  the company recorded a one time charge of million 
per share related to this refund in the third quarter of on october   the wpsc approved a permanent rate increase of million annually for these properties 
this increase was partially offset by a one time reduction in revenue of approximately  arising out of the wpsc s order to refund a portion of the previously approved interim rates 
in august  the arkansas public utility commission apuc approved tariff amendments that limited the number of minutes included for a flat rate in certain optional calling plans in certain of the markets acquired from verizon in these revisions resulted in reductions of the company s operating expenses of approximately million during compared to on march   the arkansas court of appeals vacated two orders issued by the arkansas public service commission apsc in connection with the company s acquisition of its arkansas lecs from verizon in july  and remanded the case back to the apsc for further hearings 
the court took these actions in response to challenges to the rates the company has charged other lecs for intrastate switched access service 
on december   the apsc approved the access rates established by the company at the time of acquisition 
on january   at t filed with the apsc a petition for rehearing related to this ruling 
in january  the louisiana public service commission directed its staff to review the feasibility of converting the million louisiana local optional service fund los fund into a state universal service fund 
a recommendation by the commission staff is expected by the end of currently  the los fund is funded primarily by bellsouth  which proposes to expand the base of contributors into the los fund 
the company currently receives approximately million from the los fund each year 
there can be no assurance that this funding will remain at current levels 
competition to provide traditional telephone services has thus far affected large urban areas to a greater extent than rural  suburban and small urban areas such as those in which the company s telephone operations are located 
although the company does not believe that the increased competition it has thus far experienced is likely to materially affect it in the near term  the company anticipates that regulatory changes and competitive pressures may result in future revenue reductions 
the company expects its internal telephone revenues exclusive of the properties acquired from verizon in to decline in primarily due to continued access line loss and reduced intrastate revenues  however  the company expects its internal consolidated revenues to increase in primarily due to expected increased demand for its long distance  dsl and other product offerings 
other matters 
the company s regulated telephone operations except for the properties acquired from verizon in are subject to the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation sfas 
actions by regulators can provide reasonable assurance of the existence of an asset  reduce or eliminate the value of an asset and impose a liability on a regulated enterprise 
such regulatory assets are required to be recorded and  accordingly  reflected in the balance sheet of an entity subject to sfas the company is monitoring the ongoing applicability of sfas to its regulated telephone operations due to the changing regulatory  competitive and legislative environments  and it is possible that changes in regulation  legislation or competition or in the demand for regulated services or products could result in the company s telephone operations no longer being subject to sfas in the near future 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 regulated enterprises accounting for the discontinuance of application of fasb statement no 
sfas  specifies the accounting required when an enterprise ceases to meet the criteria for application of sfas sfas requires the elimination of the effects of any actions of regulators that have been recognized as assets and liabilities in accordance with sfas but would not have been recognized as assets and liabilities by nonregulated enterprises 
sfas further provides that the carrying amounts of property  plant and equipment are to be adjusted only to the extent the assets are impaired and that impairment shall be judged in the same manner as for nonregulated enterprises 
the company s consolidated balance sheet as of december  included regulatory assets of approximately million primarily related to deferred financing costs  regulatory proceedings and income taxes and regulatory liabilities of approximately million related to income taxes 
net deferred income tax liabilities related to the regulatory assets and liabilities quantified above were million 
when the company s regulated operations no longer qualify for the application of sfas  the company does not expect to record any impairment charge related to the carrying value of the property  plant and equipment of its regulated telephone operations 
additionally  upon the discontinuance of sfas  the company would be required to revise the lives of its property  plant and equipment to reflect the estimated useful lives of the assets 
the company does not expect such revisions in asset lives to have a material impact on the company s results of operations 
for regulatory purposes  the accounting and reporting of the company s telephone subsidiaries will not be affected by the discontinued application of sfas the company has certain obligations based on federal  state and local laws relating to the protection of the environment 
costs of compliance through have not been material  and the company currently has no reason to believe that such costs will become material 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on its long term debt obligations 
the company has estimated its market risk using sensitivity analysis 
market risk is defined as the potential change in the fair value of a fixed rate debt obligation due to a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates 
fair value on long term debt obligations is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis  using the rates and maturities of these obligations compared to terms and rates currently available in the long term markets 
the results of the sensitivity analysis used to estimate market risk are presented below  although the actual results may differ from these estimates 
at december   the fair value of the company s long term debt was estimated to be billion based on the overall weighted average rate of the company s long term debt of and an overall weighted maturity of years compared to terms and rates currently available in long term financing markets 
market risk is estimated as the potential decrease in fair value of the company s fixed rate long term debt resulting from a hypothetical increase of basis points in interest rates ten percent of the company s overall weighted average borrowing rate 
such an increase in interest rates would result in approximately a million decrease in fair value of the company s long term debt 
as of december   after giving effect to interest rate swaps currently in place  approximately of the company s long term debt obligations were fixed rate 
the company seeks to maintain a favorable mix of fixed and variable rate debt in an effort to limit interest costs and cash flow volatility resulting from changes in rates 
from time to time  the company uses derivative instruments to i lock in or swap its exposure to changing or variable interest rates for fixed interest rates or ii to swap obligations to pay fixed interest rates for variable interest rates 
the company has established policies and procedures for risk assessment and the approval  reporting and monitoring of derivative instrument activities 
the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
management periodically reviews the company s exposure to interest rate fluctuations and implements strategies to manage the exposure 
at december   the company had outstanding a fair value interest rate hedge associated with million aggregate principal amount of its series h senior notes  due  that pay interest at a fixed rate of 
this hedge is a fixed to variable interest rate swap that effectively converts the company s fixed rate interest payment obligations under these notes into obligations to pay variable rates equal to the six month london interbank offered rate libor plus with settlement and rate reset dates occurring each six months through the expiration of the hedge in october at december   the company realized a rate under this hedge of 
interest expense was reduced by million in as a result of this hedge 
the fair market value of this hedge was million at december  and is reflected as an asset and as an adjustment to the underlying debt on the december  balance sheet 
with respect to this hedge  market risk is estimated as the potential change in the fair value of the hedge resulting from a hypothetical increase in the forward rates used to determine the fair value 
a hypothetical increase in the forward rates would result in a million decrease in the fair value of this hedge 
at december   the company also had outstanding a cash flow hedge associated with million of borrowings incurred in the fourth quarter of under its million credit facilities 
such hedge expires in october this hedge is designed to swap the company s future obligation to pay variable rate interest based on libor into obligations that lock in a fixed rate of 
the fair value of this hedge was million at december  and is reflected as a liability and accumulated other comprehensive loss net of tax on the december  balance sheet 
a hypothetical increase in the forward rates would result in a  decrease in the fair value liability of this hedge
