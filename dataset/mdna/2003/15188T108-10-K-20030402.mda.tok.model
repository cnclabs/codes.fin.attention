the shares were priced at and  respectively  raising proceeds net of underwriters discount  for the two issuances of approximately million 
as of december   the company had outstanding   convertible cra shares  which are convertible at the holders option into  common shares 
the convertible cra shares enable financial institutions to receive certain regulatory benefits in connection with their investment 
the company has developed a proprietary method for specially allocating these regulatory benefits to specific financial institutions that invest in the convertible cra shares 
other than the preferred allocation of regulatory benefits  the preferred investors receive the same economic benefits as common shareholders of the company  including receipt of the same dividends per share as those paid to common shareholders 
the convertible cra shares have no voting rights  except on matters relating to the terms of the convertible cra shares or to amendments to the company s trust agreement which would adversely affect the convertible cra shares 
the company s earnings are allocated pro rata among the common shares and the convertible cra shares  and the convertible cra shares rank on parity with the common shares with respect to rights upon liquidation  dissolution or winding up of the company 
the investors  at their option  have the ability to convert their convertible cra shares into common shares at a predetermined conversion price 
upon conversion  the investors will no longer be entitled to a special allocation of the regulatory benefit 
the conversion price is the greater of i the company s book value per common share as set forth in the company s most recently issued annual or quarterly report filed with the sec prior to the respective convertible cra share issuance date or ii of the closing price of a common share on the respective convertible cra share s pricing date 
the conversion price for each convertible cra share offering is indicated on the following table issuance date conversion price conversion ratio may  december  july  n a november  n a iii private label tender option program on may   the company closed on its top in order to raise additional capital to acquire additional revenue bonds 
as of december   the maximum amount of capital that could be raised under the top was million 
on december   the company refined the structure the top for the primary purpose of segregating revenue bonds issued by governmental entities in california from the remainder of the revenue bonds under the top and to increase the maximum amount of capital available under the program to million 
in addition  the top s surety commitment was extended for a five year term 
the liquidity commitment is a one year renewable commitment 
the company expects to renew or replace such commitments upon expiration of their terms 
under the top structure  the company contributes revenue bonds to chartermac origination trust i the origination trust  a wholly owned  indirect subsidiary of the company 
the origination trust then contributes certain of these revenue bonds to chartermac owner trust i the owner trust which is controlled by the company 
the owner trust contributes selected bonds to specific series trusts in order to segregate revenue bonds issued by governmental entities selected by state of origin 
as of december   four such series trusts were created two california only series and two national non state specific series 
each series trust  issues two equity certificates i a senior certificate which has been deposited into a certificate trust which issues and sells floater certificates representing proportional interests in the senior certificate to new investors and ii a residual certificate  issued to the origination trust which represents the remaining beneficial ownership interest in each series trust 
the effect of the top structure is that a portion of the interest received on revenue bonds in the owner trust is distributed through the senior certificate to the holders of the floater certificates with any remaining interest remitted to the origination trust and thus to the benefit of the company via the residual certificate 
the effect of the december   refinement of the top structure was to segregate the california related floater certificates as they generally will pay distributions at lower rates than national non state specific floater certificates and thus the yield on the residual certificates owned by the origination trust is increased 
the revenue bonds remaining in the origination trust aggregate principal amount of approximately million are an additional collateral pool for the owner trust s obligations under the senior certificate 
the balance of the top at december  the equity in the owner trust  represented by the senior certificate  was million

iv p floats rites another source for financing the company s investments is the securitization of selected revenue bonds through the merrill lynch pierce fenner smith incorporated merrill lynch p floats rites program 
merrill lynch deposits each revenue bond into an individual special purpose trust together with a credit enhancement guarantee 
two types of securities are then issued by each trust  puttable floating option tax exempt receipts p floats  a short term senior security which bears interest at a floating rate that is reset weekly and residual interest tax exempt securities rites  a subordinate security which receives the residual interest payment after payment of p float interest and ongoing transaction fees 
the p floats are sold to qualified third party  tax exempt investors and the rites are generally sold back to the company 
during the year  the company transferred six revenue bonds with an aggregate face amount of approximately million to p floats rites program and received proceeds of approximately million 
additionally  the company repurchased eight revenue bonds with an aggregate face value of approximately million 
the company s cost of funds relating to its secured borrowings under the merrill lynch p floats rites program calculated as interest expense as a percentage of the weighted average amount of the secured borrowings was approximately  and  annualized  for the years ended december  and and  respectively 
v other debt in december  cm corp

additionally  the company borrowed million to pay off loans held by pwf 
the acquisition loan commitment pwf acquisition loan is million  with an aggregate loan advance of up to million during the first three months  subject to a maximum advance ratio of of the value of pwf s mortgage servicing portfolio  following the pwf acquisition and loan closing

cm corp 
may request a resizing of the loan  up to the maximum facility size of million  in order to generate additional funding final advance that may be required the remaining stock ownership of pwf 
the final advance would equal the lesser of of the cost of the remaining equity interests of pwf or an amount that represents an overall maximum advance of of the value of the pwf mortgage servicing portfolio at the time of the final advance 
the pwf acquisition loan has a term of five years with an interest rate of libor plus 
the loan is interest only for the first twelve months 
beginning in january and through the remaining loan term  quarterly straight line principal amortization on the initial advance is paid based on a ten year amortization period 
additionally  after receiving the final advance  additional quarterly straight line principal amortization payments on the final advance will be made based on the remaining years of the amortization period for the initial advance 
pwf established a million secured  revolving mortgage warehouse facility  subject to annual renewal during december of each year 
cm corp is a guarantor of this warehouse facility 
the interest rate for each warehouse advance is the fed funds rate plus at december

critical accounting policies in preparing the consolidated financial statements  management has made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that management believes are critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of the company s accounting policies included in note to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
investment in revenue bonds and promissory notes receivable the company accounts for its investments in revenue bonds as available for sale debt securities under the provisions of sfas in most cases the company has a right to require redemption of the revenue bonds prior to their maturity  although it can and may elect to hold them up to their maturity dates unless otherwise modified 
as such  sfas requires the company to classify these investments as available for sale 
accordingly  investments in revenue bonds are carried at their estimated fair values  with unrealized gains and losses reported in other comprehensive income 
unrealized gains or losses do not affect the cash flow generated from property operations  distributions to shareholders  the characterization of the tax exempt income stream or the financial obligations under the revenue bonds 
the manager s bond review committee which meets monthly to review the status of the revenue bond portfolio 
the committee maintains a watch list of revenue bonds where the underlying property may be experiencing difficulties 
these underlying properties are identified taking into account a number of factors  including but not limited to  construction cost overruns  delays in completing construction  occupancy shortfalls and lower than expected debt service coverage ratios 
in those instances where an underlying property has been identified as possibly experiencing problems  members of the review committee work with the borrower to attempt to resolve any issues 
actions taken at this point could include recommending a change in the property management agent or such actions as extending the term of the bond  making additional advances  or reducing required payments 
if  in the judgment of the manager  it is determined probable that the company will not receive all contractual payments required  when they are due  the bond is deemed impaired and is written down to its then estimated fair value  with the amount of the write down accounted for as a realized loss 
for revenue bonds and promissory notes  interest income is recognized at the stated rate as it accrues and when collectibility of future amounts is reasonably assured 
contingent interest is recognized when received 
interest income from revenue bonds with modified terms or where the collectibility of future amounts is uncertain is recognized based upon expected cash receipts 
certain construction revenue bonds carry a higher interest rate during the construction period  which declines to a lower rate for the balance of the term 
in these cases  the company calculates the effective yield on the revenue bond and uses that rate to recognize interest over the life of the bond

no interim sharing adjustments are available for level ii and level iii loans 
the company maintains an allowance for loan losses for loans originated under the fannie mae dus product line at a level that  in management s judgment  is adequate to provide for estimated losses 
this judgment is based upon various risk assessments including the value of the collateral  the operating results of the properties  the borrower s financial condition and the company s loss experience 
the company s bond review committee meets monthly to review the status of pwf s loan portfolio and after review of the risk assessment factors may place a loan on the watch list 
such loans are tracked more closely and the committee may contact the borrowers in an attempt to resolve any issues  taking steps similar to those discussed above for revenue bonds

impairment of servicing rights is recognized in the consolidated statements of income during the applicable period through additions to a valuation allowance 
the amount of impairment recognized is the amount by which the capitalized mortgage servicing rights exceed their fair value 
subsequent to the initial measurement of impairment  the valuation allowance is adjusted to reflect changes in the measurement of impairment

in connection with the transaction  the company posted million of revenue bonds as collateral to the primary guarantor  which will be reduced to approximately million over a period of up to years as the properties reach certain operating benchmarks 
in addition  the company agreed to subordinate of each of the bonds it acquired that are secured by the properties and to not use the subordinated portion of such bonds as collateral in connection with any borrowings 
to mitigate risk  the company is the beneficiary of a guarantee against losses associated with construction and operating stabilization for each of the properties in rcgcp  which is capped at million 
the guarantee has been provided by trclp 
if the company s acquisition of related is completed  then this guarantee will no longer be in force 
as of december   trclp had a gaap net worth of approximately million with liquid assets of approximately million 
in addition  the developers of each of the properties have also been required to give recourse completion  stabilization and operating deficit guarantees 
trclp has also agreed  if needed  after construction completion and property stabilization  to fund up to the first million of operating deficits of the underlying properties or any amounts required to pay the guaranteed irr to the investor 
credit support for construction loans 
during december  the company entered into two transactions related to two properties  coventry place and canyon springs 
pursuant to the terms of these deals  the company will provide credit support to the construction lender for project completion and fmna conversion and acquire subordinated bonds to the extent the construction period bonds do not fully convert 
up until the point of completion  the company will guaranty the construction lender reimbursement of any draw on its construction letter of credit up to of the stated amount of the letter of credit 
following completion  up until the project loan converts to permanent loan status  the company will guarantee the full amount of the letter of credit 
the developer has also issued several guarantees to the construction lender  each of which would be called upon before the company s guarantees  and each of which would be assigned to the company should its guarantees are called 
once the construction loans convert to permanent loans  the company is obligated to acquire subordinated loans for the amount by which each construction loan exceeds the corresponding permanent loan  if any 
the subordinated bonds will bear interest at 
under fnma guidelines  the size of the subordinated bonds will be limited to a x debt service coverage based on of the cash flow after the senior debt 
forward commitments 
also  during december  the company entered into two forward commitment transactions related to auburn glenn and cottonwood 
pursuant to the terms of the transactions  a third party  unrelated lender will advance funds to the developers  as needed  at a floating rate 
at the completion of construction  the company is obligated to acquire the permanent revenue bonds at a predetermined price and interest rate 
the company has designated these two derivatives as hedges against the cash flow to be received from these investments

income taxes chartermac is organized as a delaware statutory trust and  for tax purposes  is classified as a partnership 
almost all of the company s recurring income is tax exempt and from time to time chartermac may sell or securitize various assets which may result in capital gains and losses 
this tax structure allows chartermac to have the pass through income characteristics as a partnership for both taxable and tax exempt income 
chartermac does not pay tax at the partnership level 
instead  the distributive share of chartermac s income  deductions and credits reported to each shareholder for inclusion on their respective income tax return 
the tax exempt income derived from most of chartermac s revenue bonds remains tax exempt as it is passed through to shareholders 
any cash dividends received by chartermac from subsidiaries  organized as corporations  will be recorded as dividend income for tax purposes such subsidiaries  created in  distributed no dividends during 
approximately of chartermac s tax basis income for each of the years ended december   and  was tax exempt for federal income tax purposes 
during  the company restructured its operations into two segments  an investing segment and an operating segment 
the investing segment invests primarily in tax exempt revenue bonds 
the operating segment  which is directly and wholly owned by chartermac  generates taxable investment and fee income through direct investment or through its pwf subsidiary 
the company provides for income taxes in accordance with fas fas requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
the company derives a substantial portion of its income from ownership of first mortgage private activity bonds 
the interest from these bonds is generally tax exempt from regular federal income tax 
however  the tax reform act of classifies the interest earned on private activity bonds issued after august  as a tax preference item for alternative minimum tax purposes amt 
the percentage of the company s tax exempt interest income subject to amt for the years ended december   and was approximately  and respectively 
amt is a mechanism within the internal revenue code to ensure that all taxpayers pay at least a minimum amount of taxes 
all taxpayers are subject to the amt calculation requirements although the vast majority of taxpayers will not actually pay amt 
as a result of amt  the percentage of the company s income that is exempt from federal income tax may be different for each shareholder depending on that shareholder s individual tax situation

in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantors accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
the interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
this interpretation does not prescribe a specific approach for subsequently measuring the guarantor s recognized liability over the term of the related guarantee 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the company has entered into one credit enhancement transaction and two yield guarantee transactions 
the fee for the credit enhancement transaction is received monthly and recognized as income when due 
the fee for the first yield guarantee transaction was received in advance was deferred and is being amortized over the guarantee period 
the company believes that the fees received approximate the fair value of the obligations undertaken in issuing the guarantees  therefore  the company s current accounting for these guarantees will not be affected by this interpretation 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of fasb statement no

 accounting for stock based compensation to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employer compensation 
because the company currently accounts for its stock options using the fair value method  implementation of this statement will not have an impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company has adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation for its share options issued to non employees 
accordingly  compensation cost is accrued based on the estimated fair value of the options issued  and amortized over the vesting period 
because vesting of the options is contingent upon the recipient continuing to provide services to the company until the vesting date  the company estimates the fair value of the non employee options at each period end up to the vesting date  and adjusts expensed amounts accordingly 
the fair value of each option grant is estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
this interpretation clarifies the application of existing accounting pronouncements to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
the provision of fin will be immediately effective for all variable interests in variable interest entities created after january   and the company will need to apply its provisions to any existing variable interests in variable interest entities by no later than july  the company believes at this time  it has no variable interests in variable interest entities requiring consolidation

inflation inflation did not have a material effect on the company s results for the periods presented 
item quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company invests in certain financial instruments  primarily revenue bonds and other bond related investments that are subject to various forms of market risk  including real estate risk  interest rate risk  credit and liquidity risk and prepayment risk 
the company seeks to prudently and actively manage such risks to earn sufficient compensation to justify the undertaking of such risks and to maintain capital levels which are commensurate with the risks the company undertakes 
real estate risk the company derives income by investing in revenue bonds secured by multi family  affordable  residential properties 
investing in such revenue bonds collateralized by such properties subjects the company to various types and degrees of risk that could adversely affect the value of the company s assets and the company s ability to generate revenue 
the factors that may reduce the company s revenues  net income and cash available for distributions to shareholders include the following the property securing a revenue bond may not generate income sufficient to meet its operating expenses and debt service on its related revenue bond  economic conditions  either local  regional or national  may limit the amount of rent that can be charged for rental units at the properties  and may result in a reduction in timely rent payments or a reduction in occupancy levels  occupancy and rent levels may be affected by construction of additional housing units and national  regional and local politics  including current or future rent stabilization and rent control laws and agreements  federal lihtc and city  state and federal housing subsidy or similar programs which apply to many of the properties  could impose rent limitations and adversely affect the ability to increase rents to maintain the properties in proper condition during periods of rapid inflation or declining market value of such properties  and  if a revenue bond defaults  the value of the property securing such revenue bond plus  for properties that have availed themselves of the federal lihtc  the value of such credit may be less than the face amount of such revenue bond 
all of these conditions and events may increase the possibility that a property owner may be unable to meet its obligations to the company under its mortgage revenue bond 
this could affect the company s net income and cash available for distribution to shareholders 
the company manages these risks through diligent and comprehensive underwriting  asset management and ongoing monitoring of loan performance 
the company may be adversely affected by periods of economic or real estate downturns that result in declining property performance or property values 
any material decline in property values used as collateral for the company s revenue bonds increases the possibility of a loss in the event of default 
additionally  some of the company s income may come from additional interest received from the participation of a portion of the cash flow  sale or refinancing proceeds on underlying properties 
the collection of such additional interest may decrease in periods of economic slowdown due to lower cash flows or values available from the properties 
in a few instances  the revenue bonds are subordinated to the claims of other senior interest and uncertainties may exist as to a borrower s ability to meet principal and interest payments 
because of these economic factors  debt service on the revenue bonds  and therefore net income and cash available for distribution to shareholders is dependent on the performance of the underlying properties 
interest rate risk the nature of the company s investments and the instruments used to raise capital for their acquisition expose the company to income and expense volatility due to fluctuations in market interest rates 
market interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond the control of the company 
the revenue bonds generally bear interest at fixed rates  or pay interest according to the cash flows of the underlying properties  which do not fluctuate with changes in market interest rates 
in contrast  payments required under the top program and on the secured borrowings under the p float program vary based on market interest rates based on the bond market association bma index and are re set weekly 
the company  through cm corp  has floating rate debt related to the acquisition financing of pwf 
pwf has loans receivable and short term borrowings related to its mortgage origination operations which are not expected to subject pwf to significant interest rate risk 
pwf typically provides mortgages to borrowers mortgages receivable by borrowing from third parties short term borrowings 
since pwf s mortgages receivable are typically subject to a take out commitment by fannie mae  freddie mac or fha  the related borrowings to finance such mortgages are typically short term 
the interest income or expense that represents the difference between the interest charged to borrowers and the interest paid to pwf s lender during the warehousing period will be earned by pwf 
other long term sources of capital  such as the company s various series of cumulative preferred shares  carry a fixed dividend rate and as such  are not impacted by changes in market interest rates 
a rising interest rate environment could reduce the demand for multi family tax exempt and taxable financing  which could limit the company s ability to invest in revenue bonds or to structure transactions 
conversely  falling interest rates may prompt historical renters to become homebuyers  in turn potentially reducing the demand for multi family housing 
an effective interest rate management strategy can be complex and no strategy can insulate the company from all potential risks associated with interest rate changes 
various financial vehicles exist which would allow company management to mitigate the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the company s cash flows and earnings 
beginning in  based upon management s analysis of the interest rate environment and the costs and risks of such strategies  the company entered into interest rate swaps in order to hedge a portion of the risk of rising interest rates and the impact of such a rise on its top and p floats programs 
on january   the company entered into a five year interest swap that fixes the bma index to on a notional amount of million 
on february   the company entered into a three year interest swap that fixes the bma index to on a notional amount of an additional million 
interest rate swap agreements are subject to risk of early termination by the company or the counterparty  possibly at times unfavorable to the company and  depending on market conditions at the time  may result in the recognition of a significant gain or loss from changes in the market value of the hedging instrument 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to acquire hedging instruments at favorable prices  or at all  when the existing arrangements expire or are terminated which would then fully expose the company to interest rate risk to the extent of the balance of debt subject to such hedges 
in addition  there is no assurance that the counterparty to these hedges will have the capacity to pay or perform under the stated terms of the interest rate swap agreement  however  the company seeks to enter into such agreements with reputable and investment grade rated counterparties to mitigate this risk 
during january  the company entered into an interest rate cap agreement with fleet bank  with a cap of on a notional amount of million 
although this transaction is designed to mitigate the company s exposure to rising interest rates  the company has not designated this interest rate cap as a hedging derivative 
with respect to the portion of the company s floating rate financing programs which are not hedged  a change in the bma rate would result in increased or decreased payments under these financing programs  without a corresponding change in cash flows from the investments in revenue bonds 
for example  based on the unhedged million million outstanding under these financing programs at december   less the million notional amount subsequently hedged and assuming a perfect hedge correlation the company estimates that an increase of in the bma rate would decrease the company s annual net income by approximately million 
conversely  a decrease in market interest rates would generally benefit the company in the same amount described above  as a result of decreased allocations to the minority interest and interest expense without corresponding decreases in interest received on revenue bonds 
the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 as amended and interpreted  on january  accordingly  the company has documented its established policy for risk management and its objectives and strategies for the use of derivative instruments to potentially mitigate such risks 
currently  the company has a strategy to reduce its interest rate risk through the use of interest rate swaps 
at inception  the company designated these interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges on the variable interest payments on its floating rate financing 
accordingly  the interest rate swaps are recorded at their fair market values each accounting period  with changes in market values being recorded in other comprehensive income to the extent that the hedge is effective in achieving offsetting cash flows 
the company assesses  both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis  whether the swap agreements are highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged financing 
any ineffectiveness in the hedging relationship is recorded in earnings 
there was no ineffectiveness in the hedging relationship during or  and the company expects that these hedging relationships will be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in cash flow throughout their terms 
net amounts payable or receivable under the swap agreements are recorded as adjustments to interest expense 
at december   the combined fair market value of the two interest rate swaps and the interest rate cap was a net liability of approximately million  included in interest rate swaps on the consolidated balance sheets 
interest paid or payable under the terms of the swaps  of approximately million  is included in interest expense for the year ended december  at december   this interest rate cap was recorded as an asset with a fair market value of  included in interest rate derivatives in the consolidated balance sheets 
because the company has not designated this derivative as a hedge  the change in fair market value flows through the consolidated statements of income  where it is included in interest income 
changes in market interest rates would also impact the estimated fair value of the company s portfolio of revenue bonds 
the company estimates the fair value for each revenue bond as the present value of its expected cash flows  using a discount rate for comparable tax exempt investments 
therefore  as market interest rates for tax exempt investments increase  the estimated fair value of the company s revenue bonds will generally decline  and a decline in interest rates would be expected to result in an increase in their estimated fair values 
for example  the company projects  using the same methodology used to estimate the portfolio fair market value under fas  that a increase in market rates for tax exempt investments would decrease the estimated fair value of its portfolio of revenue bonds from its december  value of approximately  to approximately  a decline in interest rates would increase the value of the december  portfolio to approximately  changes in the estimated fair value of the revenue bonds do not impact the company s reported net income  earnings per share  distributions or cash flows  but are reported as components of other comprehensive income and affect reported shareholders equity 
changes in interest rates would also affect both the pwf acquisition loan with fleet and the pwf warehouse lines 
a change in the underlying interest rates would affect the company s annual net income by approximately  based on the outstanding balances at december  of approximately million for the pwf acquisition loan and million for the warehouse line 
the assumptions related to the foregoing discussion of market risk involve judgments involving future economic market conditions  future corporate decisions and other interrelating factors  many of which are beyond the control of the company and all of which are difficult or impossible to predict with accuracy 
although the company believes that the assumptions underlying the forward looking information are reasonable  any of the assumptions could be inaccurate and  therefore  there can be no assurance that the forward looking information included herein will prove to be accurate 
due to the significant uncertainties inherent in forward looking information  the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation of the company that the objectives and plans of the company would be achieved 
liquidity risk the company s investments generally lack a regular trading market  particularly during turbulent market conditions or if any of the company s tax exempt revenue bonds become taxable or are in default 
there is no limitation as to the percentage of investments that may be illiquid and the company does not expect to invest a substantial portion of its assets in liquid investments 
there is a risk involved in investing in illiquid investments  particularly in the event that the company needs additional cash 
in a situation requiring additional cash  the company could be forced to liquidate some of its investments on unfavorable terms that could substantially impact the company s balance sheet and reduce the amount of distributions available and payments made in respect of the company s shares 
risk associated with securitization through securitizations  the company seeks to enhance its overall return on its investments and to generate proceeds that  along with equity offering proceeds  facilitate the acquisition of additional investments 
in the company s debt securitizations  an investment bank and or credit enhancer provides liquidity to the underlying trust and credit enhancement to the bonds  which enables the senior interests to be sold to certain accredited third party investors seeking investments rated aa or better 
the liquidity facilities are generally for one year terms and are renewable annually 
to the extent that the credit enhancer is downgraded below aa  either an alternative credit enhancement provider would be substituted to reinstate the desired investment rating or the senior interests would be marketed to other accredited investors 
in either case  it is anticipated that the return on the residual interests would decrease  which would negatively impact the company s income 
if the company is unable to renew the liquidity or credit enhancement facilities  the company would be forced to find alternative liquidity or credit enhancement facilities  repurchase the underlying bonds or liquidate the underlying bonds and its investment in the residual interests 
if the company is forced to liquidate its investment  the company would recognize gains or losses on the liquidation  which may be significant depending on market conditions 
as of december   million of the senior interests were subject to annual rollover renewal for liquidity and credit enhancement  respectively 
of the million  million is credit enhanced by a longer term facility by mbia 
the company continues to review alternatives that would reduce and diversify risks associated with securitization
