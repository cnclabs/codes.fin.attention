item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations income and expense items as a percentage of net sales year ended december  net sales cost of goods sold marketing and administrative expenses research and development expenses bad debt expenses write down of impaired assets restructuring charge income from operations net income overview of and outlook in  the company  like many companies in the manufacturing sector  continued to experience weakness due to a sluggish economy 
as a result  the industries the company primarily serves paper and steel have been affected by bankruptcies and consolidations 
the company expects the economic downturn that began in the second half of and continued throughout to continue at least into the first half of the company continues to be affected by negative factors in the industries it primarily serves since the third quarter of  seven paper mills at which the company has satellite precipitated calcium carbonate pcc plants have either shut down or announced their intention to do so 
other paper makers reduced production as a result of weaker paper demand and industry consolidations 
the steel industry continued to experience difficulties in as several steel manufacturers ceased operations and others filed for bankruptcy protection 
however  despite this difficult market environment  the company was able to achieve low double digit operating margins 
the company s operating margin as a percentage of sales declined to in as compared with in in  the company plans to continue its focus on the following growth strategies increase market penetration of pcc in paper filling at both free sheet and groundwood mills 
increase penetration of pcc into the paper coating market 
emphasize higher value specialty products and application systems to increase market penetration in the refractories segment 
continue selective acquisitions to complement the company s existing businesses 
continue research and development and marketing efforts for new and existing products 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will achieve success in implementing any one or more of these strategies 
in  the company added four units of production capacity for pcc two from expansions and two from an acquisition in february of a pcc plant in belgium 
the company also announced in january a new one unit satellite plant to be built at a paper mill owned by sabah forest industries in malaysia  which is expected to be operational in the fourth quarter of a unit represents between  to  tons of annual pcc production capacity 
the company also made the following acquisitions in on february   the company purchased a pcc manufacturing facility in hermalle sous huy  belgium  for approximately million 
on april   the company acquired the assets of a company that develops and manufactures a refractory lining monitoring system  for approximately million 
on september   the company acquired the business and assets of polar minerals inc  a privately owned producer of industrial minerals in the midwest united states  for approximately million 
in  the company expects additional expansions at existing satellite pcc plants to occur and also expects to sign contracts for new satellite pcc plants 
as the company continues to expand its operations overseas  it faces the inherent risks of doing business abroad  including inflation  fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates  changes in applicable laws and regulatory requirements  export and import restrictions  tariffs  nationalization  expropriation  limits on repatriation of funds  civil unrest  terrorism  unstable governments and legal systems  and other factors 
some of the company s operations are located in areas that have experienced political or economic instability  including indonesia  israel  china and south africa 
in addition  the company s performance depends to some extent on that of the industries it serves  particularly the paper manufacturing  steel manufacturing  and construction industries 
the company s sales of pcc are predominantly pursuant to long term agreements  generally ten years in length  with paper companies at whose mills the company operates satellite pcc plants 
the terms of many of these agreements have been extended  often in connection with an expansion of the satellite pcc plant 
failure of a number of the company s customers to renew existing agreements on terms as favorable to the company as those currently in effect could cause the future growth rate of the company to differ materially from its historical growth rate  and could also result in impairment of the assets associated with the pcc plant 
several consolidations in the paper industry have taken place in recent years 
such consolidations concentrate purchasing power in the hands of a smaller number of papermakers  enabling them to increase pressure on suppliers 
this increased pressure could have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations in the future 
in addition  these consolidations could result in partial or total closure of some paper mills at which the company operates pcc satellites 
in particular  the company s largest customer  international paper company ip  decided during to reduce production capacity by closing four paper mills at which the company had satellite pcc plants 
these closed mills are located in mobile  alabama  lock haven  pennsylvania  erie  pennsylvania  and oswego  new york 
sales to ip represented approximately of consolidated net sales in and of consolidated net sales in both and during two paper companies filed for bankruptcy protection and closed their paper mills in plainwell  michigan and anderson  california  at which the company had satellite pcc plants 
the company recorded a write down of impaired assets of million and million in and  respectively 
excluding the aforementioned plants that have been closed  there are three satellite locations at which contracts with host mills have expired and one location  representing less than one unit of pcc production  at which the host mill has informed the company that the contract will not be renewed upon its expiration in  although the company continues to supply pcc at all of these locations 
at two of these locations the company hopes to reach agreement on a long term extension of the contract  however  there can be no assurance that these negotiations will be successful 
at the other location  the customer  ip  has informed the company that it intended to begin negotiations with alternative suppliers 
the company continues to supply pcc at this location  and expects to do so through ip also informed the company at the end of the second quarter of that it would negotiate with other suppliers at other satellite locations as the contracts for those locations expire over the next several years  with the last contract expiring in that decision by ip increases the risk that some or all of these contracts will not be renewed 
because these contracts have various remaining terms  the full impact of these expirations on the company would not be felt for several years 
the company is actively pursuing its own negotiations with ip  and hopes to reach agreement to extend some or all of these contracts past their current expiration dates 
the outcome of these negotiations  however  cannot be predicted 
the loss of a substantial amount of the company s sales to ip would have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and projected growth rate 
in recognition of this increased risk  the company has shortened the periods over which existing satellite plants at ip mills are depreciated 
the shortened depreciation schedule reduced diluted earnings per share by approximately per share in the second half of other impairment losses in recent years have not been significant 
however  a complex of two paper mills at which the company operates a satellite pcc plant  at millinocket and east millinocket  maine  owned by great northern paper  inc  ceased operations on or about december  great northern paper filed for bankruptcy protection on january  and as of march   the millinocket and east millinocket mills had not resumed operations 
the bankruptcy court has appointed new management which is actively seeking a buyer for the two mills 
the company is monitoring the situation at great northern paper very closely  and believes that it will be well positioned to offer pcc to any eventual new operator of the millinocket mills when and if they emerge from bankruptcy and resume production 
if the millinocket mills do not resume production  the company could incur an impairment charge of approximately million 
the company has a consolidated interest in two joint venture companies that operate satellite pcc plants at paper mills owned by subsidiaries of asia pulp paper app  one at perawang  indonesia  and one at dagang  china 
app is a multinational pulp and paper company whose current financial difficulties have been widely publicized 
while app is negotiating with its creditors  the perawang and dagang facilities have remained in operation at levels consistent with the prior year 
both mills are continuing to use mti s pcc and to satisfy their obligations to the joint ventures 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s operations at these paper mills will not be adversely affected by app s financial difficulties in the future 
the company s net investment in these satellite plants was million at december  critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates and assumptions  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of inventories  valuation of long lived assets  goodwill and other intangible assets  pension plan assumptions  income taxes  income tax valuation allowances and litigation and environmental liabilities 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that can not readily be determined from other sources 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies require it to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements revenue recognition revenue from sale of products is recognized at the time the goods are shipped and title passes to the customer 
in most of the company s pcc contracts  the price per ton is based upon the total number of tons sold to the customer during the year 
under those contracts  the price billed to the customer for shipments during the year is based on periodic estimates of the total annual volume that will be sold to the customer 
revenues are adjusted at the end of each year to reflect the actual volume sold 
allowance for doubtful accounts substantially all of the company s accounts receivable are due from companies in the paper  construction and steel industries 
accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
such allowance is established through a charge to the provision for bad debt expenses 
the company recorded bad debt expenses of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
these charges were much higher than historical levels and were primarily related to bankruptcy filings by some of the company s customers in the paper and steel industries and to additional provisions associated with potential risks in the paper  steel and other industries 
in addition to specific allowances established for bankrupt customers  the company also analyzes the collection history and financial condition of its other customers considering current industry conditions and determines whether an allowance needs to be established or increased 
property  plant and equipment  goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets the company s sales of pcc are predominantly pursuant to long term arrangements  generally ten years in length  with paper mills at which the company operates satellite pcc plants 
the terms of many of these agreements have been extended  often in connection with an expansion of the satellite pcc plant 
the company also continues to supply pcc to three locations at which the pcc contract has expired 
property  plant and equipment  goodwill  intangible and certain other long lived assets are amortized over their useful lives 
useful lives are based on management s estimates of the period that the assets can generate revenue  which does not necessarily coincide with the remaining term of a customer s contractual obligation for use of those assets 
failure of a pcc customer to renew an agreement or continue to purchase pcc from the company could result in an impairment of assets charge at such facility 
in the third quarter of  the company reduced the useful lives of satellite pcc plants at international paper company ip mills due to an increased risk that some or all of these pcc contracts will not be renewed 
the accelerated depreciation reduced diluted earnings by approximately per share in the second half of valuation of long lived assets  goodwill and other intangible assets the company assesses the possible impairment of long lived assets and identifiable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
factors the company considers important that could trigger an impairment review include the following significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends 
when the company determines that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets or goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  it measures any impairment by its ability to recover the carrying amount of the assets from expected future operating cash flow on a discounted basis 
net intangible assets  long lived assets  and goodwill amounted to million as of december  accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing the company s consolidated financial statements  the company is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
this process involves estimating actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the consolidated balance sheet 
the company must then assess the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent it believes that recovery is not likely  it must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent it establishes a valuation allowance or increases this allowance in a period  it must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of income 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k  beginning on page f this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
results of operations net sales dollars in millions growth growth net sales worldwide net sales in increased from the previous year to million 
sales in the specialty minerals segment  which includes the pcc and processed minerals product lines  increased approximately to million compared with million for the same period in sales in the refractories segment grew approximately over the previous year to million 
in  worldwide net sales increased to million from million in the prior year 
specialty minerals segment sales decreased approximately and refractories segment sales increased approximately in worldwide net sales of pcc in increased approximately to million from million in the prior year 
paper pcc sales and volumes grew for the full year with volumes in excess of million tons  even though the paper industry was affected adversely by consolidations  shutdowns and slowdowns 
this has resulted in a reduction of over five million tons of paper capacity in the past two years 
this occurred primarily because the most efficient paper mills worldwide  which use pcc  outperformed the market as a whole 
the overall growth was primarily due to new capacity added in  to the ramp up of pcc capacity added in  and to increased worldwide volume from existing satellites  which collectively more than compensated for the aforementioned paper mill shutdowns 
most of this growth came in the uncoated free sheet market  which consists of high quality printing and writing paper 
the company also achieved good growth in the groundwood sector of the paper market  which produces magazines  catalog and directory papers 
groundwood paper  which is produced from less refined pulp  is an important market for the company because it represents nearly half of worldwide paper production 
today  the company supplies pcc to approximately groundwood paper machines at about paper mills 
the specialty pcc product line reflected a sales increase over the prior year 
the merchant pcc manufacturing facility in brookhaven  mississippi has shown improved sales levels but still remains below its expected volumes 
specialty pcc also continues to experience competitive pressure from lower cost ground calcium carbonate in the calcium supplement market 
pcc sales in decreased approximately to million from million in net sales of processed minerals products in increased to million from million in this increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of polar minerals inc processed minerals net sales increased slightly in to million from million in net sales in the refractories segment in increased approximately to million from million in the prior year 
the increase in sales for the refractories segment in was attributable primarily to the acquisitions of the martin marietta refractories business and rijnstaal bv  which more than offset unfavorable economic conditions in the worldwide steel industry 
in  net sales in the refractories segment increased from the prior year 
net sales in the united states was million in  approximately higher than in the prior year 
increased sales from the acquisitions were partially offset by the aforementioned weakness in the steel and paper industries 
international sales in increased primarily as a result of the continued international expansion of the company s pcc product line and acquisitions 
in  domestic net sales were slightly higher than the prior year  and international sales were approximately greater than in the prior year 
operating costs and expenses dollars in millions growth growth cost of goods sold marketing and administrative research and development bad debt expenses restructuring charge write down of impaired assets percentage not meaningful cost of goods sold was of sales compared with in the prior year 
this increase occurred in both business segments 
in the specialty minerals segment  the gross margin ratio was adversely affected by development costs at the new merchant pcc facility in hermalle  belgium  increased costs to provide synsil trial material  and increased depreciation expense for satellite pcc plants located at international paper s mills 
in the refractories segment  production and inventory problems at certain north american facilities  volume losses due to slowdowns and closures in high margin integrated steel mill accounts  and increased development costs associated with new products and systems contributed to the adverse gross margin ratio 
marketing and administrative costs increased in to million and decreased to of net sales from in in  marketing and administrative costs decreased to million 
research and development expenses during decreased to million and represented of net sales 
this decrease was primarily a result of the restructuring and lower pcc trial expenses 
in  research and development expenses decreased and represented of sales 
this decrease was primarily the result of the restructuring  a decrease in pcc trial activity and a shift of synsil product activities from development to production 
the company recorded bad debt expenses of million and million in and  respectively 
these charges were primarily related to additional provisions associated with the great northern paper company s bankruptcy filing and to additional provisions associated with potential risks to its customers in the steel  paper and other industries 
during the second quarter of  the company restructured its operations to reduce operating costs and improve efficiency 
this resulted in a second quarter restructuring charge of million 
this restructuring reduced operating expenses by million to million annually 
these expense reductions were partially realized during the second half of during the first quarter of  the company recorded a write down of impaired assets of million for a satellite plant that ceased operations 
in  the company recorded a write down of impaired assets of million for three satellite pcc plants at paper mills that ceased operations 
income from operations dollars in millions growth growth income from operations income from operations in increased slightly to million from million in income from operations decreased to of sales as compared with of sales in this decrease was primarily due to the aforementioned decrease in the gross margin ratios 
in  income from operations decreased to million from million in this decrease was due primarily to weakness for the full year in the three major industries the company serves and to the aforementioned restructuring charge 
non operating deductions dollars in millions growth growth non operating deductions  net non operating deductions decreased from the prior year 
this decrease was due to lower interest rates and lower average borrowings in when compared with in  interest expense increased from due primarily to higher average borrowings than in provision for taxes on income dollars in millions growth growth provision for taxes on income the effective tax rate decreased to in compared with in this decrease was due to changes in the geographic mix of profit by country 
the effective tax rate was in minority interests dollars in millions growth growth minority interests the consolidated joint ventures continue to operate profitably and were at the approximate same level of profitability over the last two years 
net income dollars in millions growth growth net income net income increased in to million 
in  net income decreased to million 
earnings per common share  on a diluted basis  increased to in as compared with in the prior year 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows in were provided from operations and proceeds from stock option exercises 
the cash was applied principally to fund approximately million of capital expenditures  the aforementioned acquisitions  to repay million in short term debt  and to repurchase million of common shares for treasury 
cash provided from operating activities amounted to million in  million in  and million in included in cash flow from operations was pension plan funding of approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
on february   the board authorized the company s management committee to repurchase  at its discretion  up to million in additional shares per year over the following three years 
as of december   the company had repurchased approximately  shares under this program at an average price of approximately per share 
the company has million in uncommitted short term bank credit lines  of which million was in use at december  the company anticipates that capital expenditures for should range between million and million  principally related to the construction of pcc plants and other opportunities that meet the strategic growth objectives of the company 
the company expects to meet its long term financing requirements from internally generated funds  uncommitted bank credit lines and  where appropriate  project financing of certain satellite plants

prospective information and factors that may affect future results the securities and exchange commission encourages companies to disclose forward looking information so that investors can better understand companies future prospects and make informed investment decisions 
this report may contain forward looking statements that set out anticipated results based on management s plans and assumptions 
words such as expects  plans  anticipates  will  and words and terms of similar substance  used in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance identify these forward looking statements 
the company cannot guarantee that the outcomes suggested in any forward looking statement will be realized  although it believes it has been prudent in its plans and assumptions 
achievement of future results is subject to risks  uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions 
should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize  or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate  actual results could vary materially from those anticipated  estimated or projected 
investors should bear this in mind as they consider forward looking statements and should refer to the discussion of certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions under the heading cautionary factors that may affect future results in item inflation historically  inflation has not had a material adverse effect on the company 
the contracts pursuant to which the company constructs and operates its satellite pcc plants generally adjust pricing to reflect increases in costs resulting from inflation 
cyclical nature of customers businesses the bulk of the company s sales are to customers in the paper manufacturing  steel manufacturing and construction industries  which have historically been cyclical 
these industries encountered difficulties in the pricing structure of some of the company s long term pcc contracts makes its pcc business less sensitive to declines in the quantity of product purchased 
for this reason  and because of the geographical diversification of its business  the company s operating results to date have not been materially affected by the difficult economic environment 
however  it cannot predict the economic outlook in the countries in which the company does business  nor in the key industries it serves 
there can be no assurance that a recession  in some markets or worldwide  would not have a significant negative effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
 effective for fiscal years beginning after june   addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
this statement requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of the fair value can be determined  and that the associated asset retirement costs be capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
the effect of this standard on the company s results of operations and financial position is being evaluated 
it is likely that there will be significant obligations related to the future retirement of assets related to the company s pcc satellite facilities and its mining properties which will result in a non cash after tax charge to earnings of approximately million in the first quarter of for the cumulative effect of this accounting change 
excluding the cumulative effect adjustment  the company estimates the impact of additional depreciation expense on the long lived assets and accretion expense related to the liabilities to approximate million in in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this statement is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december   and is not expected to have a material effect on the company s results of operation or financial position 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness to others  and interpretation of fasb statements no 
 and and a rescission of fasb interpretation no 
this interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under guarantees issued 
the interpretation also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of the interpretation are applicable to guarantees issued or modified after december  and are not expected to have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim and annual periods ending after december  in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of fasb statement no 
this statement amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation  and would require additional disclosures in the financial statements 
these disclosure modifications are included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the company is currently analyzing the other provisions of this statement 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in market prices and rates 
the company is exposed to market risk because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar 
it does not anticipate that near term changes in exchange rates will have a material impact on its future earnings or cash flows 
however  there can be no assurance that a sudden and significant decline in the value of foreign currencies would not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
approximately of the company s bank debt bears interest at variable rates  therefore the company s results of operations would only be affected by interest rate changes to the short term bank debt outstanding 
an immediate percent change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the company s results of operations over the next fiscal year 
the company is exposed to various market risks  including the potential loss arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
the company does not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
when appropriate  the company enters into derivative financial instruments  such as forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps  to mitigate the impact of foreign exchange rate movements and interest rate movements on the company s operating results 
the counterparties are major financial institutions 
such forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps would not subject the company to additional risk from exchange rate or interest rate movements because gains and losses on these contracts would offset losses and gains on the assets  and liabilities and transactions being hedged 
the company had open forward exchange contracts to purchase million of foreign currencies as of december  these contracts matured on june  the fair value of these instruments was  at december  the company entered into three year interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount of million that expire in january these agreements effectively convert a portion of the company s floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis 
the fair value of these instruments was  at december
