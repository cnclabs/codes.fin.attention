item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a worldwide leader in the design  development  manufacture and support of process control metrology systems used in semiconductor device manufacturing 
our thin film measurement proprietary systems measure the thickness and other properties of thin films applied during various steps in the manufacture of integrated circuits  enabling semiconductor device manufacturers to improve yields and reduce overall production costs 
our macro defect inspection proprietary systems detect and classify defects in semiconductor wafers 
we provide our customers with a flexible full fab metrology solution by offering families of systems that meet their transparent and opaque thin film measurement and macro defect inspection needs in various applications across the fabrication process 
our three primary families of metrology solutions offer leading edge metrology technology  flexible systems cost effectively designed for specific manufacturing applications and a common production worthy automation platform  all backed by worldwide support 
historically  a significant portion of our revenues in each quarter and year has been derived from sales to relatively few end user customers  and we expect this trend to continue 
in  and sales to end user customers that individually represented at least five percent of our revenues accounted for  and of our revenues 
in  and sales to intel accounted for  and of our revenues 
in addition  a significant portion of our revenues in each quarter and year has been derived from sales to tokyo electron limited tel  our sole distributor 
tel purchases our products for ultimate distribution to customers in japan 
in  and sales to tel accounted for  and of our revenues 
we expect that sales to tel will continue to represent a portion of our revenues for at least the next several years 
we do not have purchase contracts with any of our customers or distributors that obligate them to continue to purchase our products  and they could cease purchasing products from us at any time 
a delay in purchase or cancellation by any of our large customers could cause quarterly revenues to vary significantly 
in addition  during a given quarter  a significant portion of our revenues may be derived from the sale of a relatively small number of systems 
our transparent film measurement systems range in price from approximately  to million per system  our opaque film measurement systems range in price from approximately  to million per system and our macro defect inspection systems range in price from approximately  to million per system 
accordingly  a small change in the number of systems we sell may also cause significant changes in our operating results 
because fluctuations in the timing of orders from our major customers or distributors or in the number of our individual systems we sell could cause our revenues to fluctuate significantly in any given quarter or year  we do not believe that period to period comparisons of our financial results are necessarily meaningful  and they should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance 
a significant portion of our revenues has been derived from customers outside of the united states  and we expect this trend to continue 
in  approximately of our revenues were derived from customers outside of the united states  of which were derived from customers in asia and were derived from customers in europe 
in  approximately of our revenues were derived from customers outside of the united states  of which were derived from customers in asia and were derived from customers in europe 
in  approximately of our revenues were derived from customers outside of the united states  of which were derived from customers in asia and were derived from customers in europe 
substantially all of our revenues to date have been denominated in united states dollars 
the sales cycle for our systems typically ranges from six to months  and can be longer when our customers are evaluating new technology 
due to the length of these cycles  we invest significantly in research and development and sales and marketing in advance of generating revenues related to these investments 
additionally  the rate and timing of customer orders may vary significantly from month to month 
accordingly  if sales of our products do not occur when we expect  and we are unable to adjust our estimates on a timely basis  our expenses and inventory levels may increase relative to revenues and total assets 
on september   we acquired isoa  inc  which we renamed the yield metrology group ymg 
ymg had licensed its technology for use in the semiconductor industry and recently began transitioning to a semiconductor capital equipment supplier 
ymg s core technologies are knowledge based algorithms used in wafer macro defect detection and classification 
the purchase consideration for ymg  including direct acquisition costs  was million in cash 
the transaction was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting for business combinations 
results of operations of ymg have been included since september  and will affect comparisons from year to year 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  our statements of income data as percentages of our revenues 
our results of operations are reported as one reportable business segment

our revenues are derived from the sale of our metrology systems  services and spare parts 
our revenues were million  million and million in the years  and these changes represent a decrease of from to and a decrease of from to the decreases in revenues from through were primarily due to an industry wide slowdown in demand for semiconductor devices and equipment  which resulted in a decrease in orders for our products as well as postponements and cancellations of existing orders 
revenues from customers outside of the united states represented  and of our revenues in  and revenues from customers outside of the united states decreased as a percentage of revenues from through as a result of decreased sales to existing customers in europe and asia 
we expect that revenues generated from customers outside of the united states will continue to account for a significant percentage of our revenues 
our business continues to be impacted by the slowdown in economies worldwide 
we have been further affected by the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry with recurring periods of oversupply and overcapacity 
these factors have resulted in a downturn in demand for our products 
we currently do not have visibility as to the length or severity of the downturn 
we do expect demand for our products to improve once customers adjust to the period of oversupply and overcapacity and historical levels of capital expenditures resume 
there has been no current evidence  however  that customer buying patterns will significantly increase in the near term 
there is a risk that the slowdown may be prolonged further 
certain of our customers  including intel  have announced anticipated declines in overall capital expenditures for cost of revenues and gross profit 
cost of revenues consists of the labor  material and overhead costs of manufacturing our systems  royalties  spare parts cost and the cost associated with our worldwide service support infrastructure 
our gross profit was million  million and million in  and these changes represent decreases of from to and from to our gross profit represented  and of our revenues in  and the decreases in gross profit from through were primarily due to a decrease in business volume  which resulted in customer support and fixed manufacturing costs being a higher component of a lower revenue base 
research and development 
the thin film transparent and opaque process control metrology market is characterized by continuous technological development and product innovations 
we believe that the rapid and ongoing development of new products and enhancements to existing products  including the transition to copper and low k dielectrics  the progression to mm wafers  the continuous shrinkage in critical dimensions  and the evolution of ultra thin gate process control  is critical to our success 
accordingly  we devote a significant portion of our technical  management and financial resources to research and development programs 
research and development expenditures consist primarily of salaries and related expenses of employees engaged in research  design and development activities 
they also include consulting fees  prototype equipment expenses and the cost of related supplies 
our research and development expenditures were  million  million and million in  and these changes represent increases of from to and from to research and development expenditures represented  and of revenues in  and the increase in research and development expenses from through resulted from higher personnel costs  parts costs associated with new product development and engineering facilities expansion 
in process research and development 
the acquisition of ymg resulted in our recording of a one time expense of million for the write off of in process research and development iprd 
the iprd we acquired related to automated defect inspection technology to be used in stand alone and integrated metrology equipment 
at the time of the acquisition  we determined that the iprd had not reached technological feasibility and that it did not have an alternative future use 
accordingly  this amount was immediately expensed in the consolidated statement of operations upon the acquisition date 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense is primarily comprised of salaries and related costs for sales  marketing  and general administrative personnel  as well as commissions  and other non personnel related expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expense was million  million and million in  and these changes represent decreases of from to and from to selling  general and administrative expense represented  and of revenues in  and the decreases from through resulted from lower commissions  the completion of certain infrastructure projects in prior periods and cost reduction initiatives that were implemented as a result of the semiconductor industry slowdown 
amortization 
our expense for amortization was million in and and million in the increase in is attributable to the amortization of intangible assets having definite useful lives acquired from the acquisition of ymg 
effective january  we adopted the provisions prescribed by the financial accounting standards board fasb in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets 
consequently  we ceased amortizing goodwill as of such date 
amortization expense relating to goodwill is immaterial in and interest income and other  net 
interest income and other  net was million  million and million in  and the increase from to resulted from investing the net proceeds from our follow on public offering in february the decrease from to resulted from lower interest rates and the use of cash in the acquisition of ymg as described further in note to the consolidated financial statements 
provision benefit for income taxes 
we use the liability method of accounting for income taxes prescribed by the fasb in sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
our provision benefit for income taxes was a benefit of million in  a provision of million in and a provision of million in our effective tax rate was  and in  and  respectively 
during  the net deferred tax asset was reduced to zero with a valuation allowance as a result of recurring losses and with the uncertainty regarding our ability to generate sufficient taxable income 
in  based on industry and internal forecasts combined with the successful completion of our initial public offering and the reduction of debt  we reduced the deferred tax valuation allowance by million  for certain deferred tax assets that more likely than not would be realized 
despite losses incurred in and recent downward trends in the industry  management believes it is more likely than not the company will realize the benefits of its deferred tax assets 
we computed our effective tax rate for on prevailing federal and state rates adjusted for research and development tax credits and income derived from tax exempt interest 
our effective tax rate for is less than the expected combined federal and state tax rates of primarily due to the non deductibility of the iprd charge for book and tax purposes 
change in accounting principle 
effective january   we changed our method of accounting for revenue recognition to comply with securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
revenue is now recognized upon shipment provided that there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
certain sales of our products are sold and accounted for as multiple element arrangements  consisting of the sale of the product and installation 
we generally recognize revenue upon delivery of the product  which is prior to installation  as the actions required to perform the installation are deemed to be perfunctory 
installation is deemed to be perfunctory based on our sales and installation history for similar products and customers and the fact that other vendors can and have performed the installation 
when customer acceptance is subjective and not obtained prior to shipment  we defer a portion of the product revenue until such time as positive affirmation of acceptance has been obtained from the customer 
customer acceptance is generally based on our products meeting published performance specifications 
the amount of revenue allocated to the shipment of products is done on a residual method basis 
under this method  the total arrangement value is allocated first to undelivered contract elements  based on their fair values  with the remainder being allocated to product revenue 
the fair value of installation services is based upon billable hourly rates and the estimated time to complete the service 
revenue related to undelivered installation services is deferred until such time as installation is completed at the customer s site 
previously  we had recognized revenue upon shipment of equipment to customers  which usually preceded installation and final customer acceptance  provided final customer acceptance and collection of the related receivable were probable 
the effect of the change was to decrease revenue by million for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and million in working capital 
at december  we had million of cash and cash equivalents and million in working capital 
at december  our cash and cash equivalents totaled million  while working capital amounted to million 
typically during periods of revenue growth  changes in accounts receivable and inventories represent a use of cash as we incur costs and expend cash in advance of receiving cash from our customers 
similarly  during periods of declining revenue  changes in accounts receivable and inventories represent a source of cash as inventory purchases decline and revenue from prior periods is collected 
operating activities used million in cash provided by operating activities in and was million and million  respectively 
the use of cash in operating activities during was primarily the result of having to fund an increase in accounts receivable and an increase in inventories  offset by net income 
net cash provided by operating activities in was primarily due to net income combined with a decrease in accounts receivable 
the net cash provided by operating activities during was primarily a result of increases in deferred revenue of million  accrued liabilities of million  profit before depreciation  amortization and the write off of iprd of million  partially offset by an increase in inventories of million and an increase in accounts receivable of million 
net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million in  and capital expenditures for were primarily used for the purchase and installation of enterprise resource planning software  computer equipment necessary for our operations and costs associated with renovations to our corporate headquarters 
capital expenditures for were primarily used for renovations to our corporate facility and upgrades to existing computer systems 
net cash used in investing activities for included the acquisition of ymg  net of cash acquired  of million  purchases of short term investments of million and capital expenditures of million 
capital expenditures over the next twelve months are expected to be approximately million 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million in  and in  net cash provided by financing activities equaled the cash proceeds received by us when our employees exercised stock options and participated in the employee stock purchase plan 
in february  we completed the follow on public offering of  shares of our common stock at per share 
net proceeds to us after the underwriting discount and other fees amounted to million 
in addition  we received cash proceeds of million from stock option exercises and participation in our employee stock purchase plan 
net cash provided by financing activities in was a result of proceeds received from sales of shares  including sales of shares through employee stock plans and proceeds received from a director of the company in connection with his sale of the company s stock 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the timing and amount of our revenues and our investment decisions  which will affect our ability to generate additional cash 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for working capital  capital expenditures  and research and development activities for the foreseeable future 
thereafter  if cash generated from operations and financing activities is insufficient to satisfy our working capital requirements  we may seek additional funding through bank borrowings  sales of securities or other means 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise any such capital on terms acceptable to us or at all 
our significant commitments consist of operating leases 
we lease our manufacturing  service and sales facilities and certain equipment under operating leases that expire through the total future minimum lease payments under non cancelable operating leases at december  amounted to    and for the years to  respectively 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to accounts receivable  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes and warranty obligations 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions 
these estimates and judgments are reviewed by management on an ongoing basis  and by the audit committee at the end of each quarter prior to the public release of our financial results 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
effective january   we changed our method of accounting for revenue recognition to comply with sab revenue is recognized upon shipment provided that there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
certain sales of our products are sold and accounted for as multiple element arrangements  consisting of the sale of the product and installation 
we generally recognize revenue upon delivery of the product  which is prior to installation  as the actions required to perform the installation are deemed to be perfunctory 
installation is deemed to be perfunctory based on our sales and installation history for similar products and customers and the fact that other vendors can and have performed the installation 
when customer acceptance is subjective and not obtained prior to shipment  we defer a portion of the product revenue until such time as positive affirmation of acceptance has been obtained from the customer 
customer acceptance is generally based on our products meeting published performance specifications 
the amount of revenue allocated to the shipment of products is done on a residual method basis 
under this method  the total arrangement value is allocated first to undelivered contract elements  based on their fair values  with the remainder being allocated to product revenue 
the fair value of installation services is based upon billable hourly rates and the estimated time to complete the service 
revenue related to undelivered installation services is deferred until such time as installation is completed at the customer s site 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable and analyze historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers was to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments or our assumptions are otherwise incorrect  additional allowances may be required 
excess and obsolete inventory 
we write down our excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future product life cycles  product demand and market conditions 
if actual product life cycles  product demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
long lived assets and acquired intangible assets 
the company periodically reviews long lived assets  other than goodwill  for impairment whenever events changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
goodwill  in accordance with sfas no 
 is reviewed for possible impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter for each year 
a review of goodwill may be initiated prior to conducting the annual analysis if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired 
assumptions and estimates used in the determination of impairment losses  such as future cash flows and disposition costs  may affect the carrying value of long lived assets and the impairment of such long lived assets  if any  could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
warranties 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in product quality programs and processes  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our actual current tax exposure together with our temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
at december   we had no valuation allowance established against our deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred taxes will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish a valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
impact of recent accounting pronouncements in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations effective for fiscal years beginning after june  
sfas no 
addresses accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and retirement of assets 
we are currently evaluating the impact of sfas no 
 but do not expect that our adoption on january  will have a material effect on our financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
we are required to adopt the provisions of sfas no 
effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  the adoption of sfas no 
will impact the types and timing costs associated with any future exit activities of which no material activities are currently planned 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness to others  an interpretation of fasb statements no 
 and and a rescission of fasb interpretation no 
this interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim annual financial statements about its obligations under guarantees issued 
the interpretation also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of the interpretation are applicable to guarantees issued or modified after december  and are not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements 
the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of fasb statement no 
this statement amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
we expect to continue to account for stock options under accounting principles board opinion no 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements 
certain of the disclosure modifications are required for fiscal years ending after december  and are included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
audit committee approval of non audit services section a i of the securities exchange act of  as added by section of the sarbanes oxley act of  requires disclosure of the approval of our audit committee of non audit services to be performed by our external auditor 
the audit committee approved engagements of kpmg llp  our external auditor  for the following non audit services tax services  k audit  and acquisition related due diligence 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from our investments in certain available for sale securities 
our available for sale securities consist primarily of fixed income investments us treasury and agency securities and corporate bonds 
we continually monitor our exposure to changes in interest rates and credit ratings of issuers from our available for sale securities 
accordingly  we believe that the effects of changes in interest rates and credit ratings of issuers are limited and would not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
however  it is possible that we are at risk if interest rates or credit ratings of issuers change in an unfavorable direction 
the magnitude of any gain or loss will be a function of the difference between the fixed rate of the financial instrument and the market rate and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected 
foreign currency risk we do not use foreign currency forward exchange contracts or purchased currency options to hedge local currency cash flows or for trading purposes 
all sales arrangements with international customers are denominated in us dollars 
we have branch operations in taiwan  singapore  china and korea and a wholly owned subsidiary in europe  which are subject to currency fluctuations 
these foreign branches are limited in their operations and level of investment so that the risk of currency fluctuations is not expected to be material
