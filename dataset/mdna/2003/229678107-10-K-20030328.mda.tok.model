overview cubist is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the research  development and commercialization of antiinfective drugs 
in december  cubist filed a new drug application  or nda  with the united states food drug administration  or fda  for our lead investigational antibiotic cidecin for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections  or csssi  caused by gram positive organisms 
cidecin is the first antibiotic in a new class of drug candidates called lipopeptides and attacks bacteria through a novel mechanism of action 
cidecin has demonstrated the ability in vitro to rapidly kill virtually all clinically significant gram positive bacteria  including those resistant to current therapies 
in february  the fda accepted the cidecin nda and granted the filing priority review status  indicating that cidecin  if approved  would represent a therapeutic advance over existing medicines  and established a target date to act on the nda filing by june  in july  cubist acquired exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize a novel cephalosporin  referred to as cab cab is a unique investigational antibiotic in late stage pre clinical development that has demonstrated in vitro activity against most clinically relevant gram positive and gram negative bacteria  including important resistant species such as methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus  or mrsa 
cubist is also developing an oral formulation of the antibiotic ceftriaxone  or octx  which is currently available only in an intravenous formulation and marketed by hoffmann la roche under the brand name rocephin 
we have developed a capsule version of this formulation and are continuing pre clinical studies to determine the suitability of this formulation for human clinical development 
additionally  cubist uses its natural products and other technologies to identify novel pharmaceutical compounds 
since cubist s incorporation  it has experienced significant net losses 
the company has an accumulated deficit of million through december  the company expects to incur significant additional operating losses over the next several years due to the implementation of manufacturing  distribution  marketing and sales capabilities as well as continued research and development efforts  and pre clinical testing and clinical trials

this table represents cubist s best estimates of its current minimum obligations and forecasts 
critical accounting policies and estimates cubist prepares its consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the company is required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures  actual amounts may differ 
the policies described below represent those that are broadly applicable to our operations and involve additional management judgment due to the sensitivity of the methods  assumptions and estimates necessary in determining the related amounts 
such significant accounting policies are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating cubist s reported financial results 
i 
revenue recognition cubist recognizes revenue in accordance with the sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab 
principal sources of revenue are license fees and milestone payments  which are derived from collaborative agreements with other biotechnology companies 
non refundable license fees are recorded as deferred revenue once received and are recognized ratably over the development period to which they relate 
the relevant time period for the product development phase is based on management estimates and could vary depending on the outcome of clinical trials and the regulatory approval process 
such changes could materially impact the revenue recognized 
as a result  management continually reviews the relevant time period 
revenue from milestone payments related to arrangements under which the company has continuing performance obligations are recognized as revenue upon achievement of the milestone only if all of the following conditions are met  the milestone payments are non refundable  achievement of the milestone was not reasonably assured at the inception of the arrangement  substantive effort is involved in achieving the milestone  and the amount of the milestone is reasonable in relation to the effort expended or the risk associated with the achievement of the milestone 
if any of these conditions are not met  the milestone payments are deferred and recognized as revenue over the term of the arrangement as the company completes its performance obligations 
revenues from research funding are recognized when the services are performed in order to match revenues to expenses incurred 
revenue from small business innovation research sbir grants to conduct research and development is recognized as eligible costs are incurred up to the funding limit 
ii 
accrued liabilities  specifically the clinical research organization costs the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period reported 
specifically  the company s management must make estimates of costs incurred to date  but not yet invoiced by external entities such as cros 
management analyzes the progress of clinical trials  invoices received  and budgeted costs when evaluating the adequacy of the accrued liability 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the accrued balance in any accounting period 
actual results may differ from the amount and timing of the accrued balance for any period 
iii 
investments all investments are held to maturity  as the intention is to hold these assets in accordance with cubist s investment policy 
however  if the circumstances regarding an investment were to change  such as a change in an investment s external credit rating  cubist would consider a sale of the related security to minimize any losses 
the appropriateness of all investment classifications is reviewed at each reporting date 
iv 
intangible and long lived assets purchase accounting requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the fair market value of the assets and liabilities purchased 
these assets are amortized over their useful lives 
long lived assets consist of cubist s corporate headquarters building which is being depreciated over its estimated useful life 
useful lives are based on management s estimates of the period during which the assets will be used by the company 
intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on historical and projected future operating results  changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets  overall business strategy  and market and economic trends 
future events could cause management to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that certain intangibles assets are impaired 
v 
income taxes cubist records deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the net tax effects of tax credits  operating loss carry forwards  and temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
cubist then assesses the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent that cubist determines that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance is established 
the valuation allowance is based on estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which cubist operates and the period over which deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
through december   cubist believes it is more likely than not that all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized and  accordingly  has recorded a valuation allowance against substantially all deferred tax assets 
if results of operations in the future indicate that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be recovered  the reduction of the valuation allowance will be recorded as a tax benefit during one or over many periods 
new accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 or fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  to expand upon and strengthen existing accounting guidance that addresses when a company should include in its financial statements the assets  liabilities and activities of another entity 
until now  one company generally has included another entity in its consolidated financial statements only if it controlled the entity through voting interests 
fin changes that by requiring a variable interest entity  as defined  to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
fin also requires disclosures about variable interest entities that the company is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest 
the consolidation requirements of fin apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  and to older entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  certain of the disclosure requirements apply in all financial statements issued after january   regardless of when the variable interest entity was established 
the company does not expect the provisions of fin to have a material effect on its results of operations and financial position 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
this statement  which is effective for fiscal years ending after december   amends statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation 
in addition  statement no 
amends the disclosure requirements of statement no 
regardless of the accounting method used to account for stock based compensation 
we have chosen to continue to account for stock based compensation of employees using the intrinsic value method prescribed in accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
however  the enhanced disclosure provisions as defined by statement no 
have been included in note b of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb emerging issues task force reached consensus on eitf no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf no 
addresses the accounting treatment for arrangements that provide the delivery or performance of multiple products or services where the delivery of a product  system or performance of services may occur at different points in time or over different periods of time 
eitf no 
requires the separation of the multiple deliverables that meet certain requirements into individual units of accounting that are accounted for separately under the appropriate authoritative accounting literature 
eitf no 
is applicable to revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  the company does not expect the provisions of eitf to have a material effect on its results of operations and financial position 
in november  the fasb issued fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  an interpretation of fasb statements no 
  and and rescission of fasb interpretation no 
fin clarifies the requirements of fasb statement no 
 accounting for contingencies relating to the guarantor s accounting for  and disclosure of  the issuance of certain types of guarantees 
for guarantees that fall within the scope of fin  the interpretation requires that guarantors recognize a liability equal to the fair value of the guarantee upon its issuance 
the disclosure provisions of the interpretation are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods that end after december  however  the provisions for initial recognition and measurement are effective on a prospective basis for guarantees that are issued or modified after december   irrespective of a guarantor s year end 
the company does not expect the measurement provisions of fin to have a material effect on its results of operations and financial position 
pursuant to the amended and restated by laws of cubist pharmaceutical  inc  article  cubist officers and directors are indemnified and held harmless by the corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the delaware general corporation law while the officer or director is serving or has served at the request of the corporation 
these indemnifications were grandfathered under the provisions of fin no 
as they were in effect prior to december  accordingly  we have no liabilities recorded relating to this indemnification as of december  in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities which nullifies eitf issue no 
liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred  whereas eitf no 
had allowed the liability to be recorded at the commitment date of an exit plan 
we are required to adopt the provisions of sfas effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  it is not anticipated that this pronouncement will have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections as of april sfas no 
eliminates sfas no 
reporting gains and losses from extinguishment of debt which required companies to classify gains or losses from the extinguishment of debt as extraordinary items  net of tax 
as a result of this new sfas  gains and losses from extinguishment of debt should be classified as extraordinary items only if they meet the criteria in apb opinion no 
reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
this pronouncement has not had a material impact on the company s financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about cubist s market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
cubist is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations 
cubist currently owns financial instruments that are sensitive to market risks as part of its investment portfolio 
the investment portfolio is used to preserve capital until it is required to fund operations 
none of these market risk sensitive instruments is held for trading purposes 
the investment portfolio includes investment grade debt instruments 
these bonds are subject to interest rate risk  and could decline in value if interest rates fluctuate 
due to the conservative nature of these instruments  cubist does not believe that it has a material exposure to interest rate risk 
cubist does not own derivative financial instruments 
interest rate risk cubist does not engage in trading market risk sensitive instruments or purchasing hedging instruments or other than trading instruments that are likely to expose cubist to market risk  whether interest rate  foreign currency exchange  commodity price or equity price risk 
cubist has not purchased options or entered into swaps  forward or futures contracts 
the primary market risk exposure is that of interest rate risk on borrowings under cubist s credit facility  which are subject to interest rates based on the bank s base rate 
a change in the applicable interest rate on this loan would affect the rate at which cubist could borrow funds 
cubist estimates that the hypothetical loss in earnings for one year of borrowings held at december   resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates  would not have materially impacted net income or materially affected the fair value of interest rate sensitive instruments 
foreign currency risk cubist faces exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
international revenues and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies 
the functional currency of cubist s united kingdom subsidiary is the united states dollar 
cubist s international activities are subject to risks typical of an international business  including  but not limited to differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
based on cubist s overall currency rate exposure at december   a change in foreign exchange rates would have had an immaterial effect on its financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
cubist is not currently involved in any foreign currency hedging transactions
