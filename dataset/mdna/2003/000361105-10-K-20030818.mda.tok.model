aar manufacturing  inc  a subsidiary of the company subsidiary received an administrative order for response activity order dated august   from the michigan department of environmental quality mdeq relating to environmental conditions at and in the vicinity of the subsidiary s cadillac  michigan plant 
the order requires the subsidiary to perform environmental investigatory work  prepare a feasibility study and a remedial action plan  and perform interim response actions 
the interim response actions include continuation of the response activities the subsidiary is performing under a consent decree  operation of a soil vapor extraction system the subsidiary had previously installed and operated  determination of the need to provide alternate water supplies to off site properties and if it is so determined then to actually provide it  removal of any free phase liquids encountered in the ground  providing notices of groundwater contamination migration to off site property owners  and other actions determined by the mdeq or the subsidiary to be appropriate 
a letter dated june  from the mdeq further demands payment of environmental response costs already incurred by the mdeq in the amount of plus interest plus unspecified costs to be incurred in the future by the mdeq 
the order and the letter which accompanies the order threaten the imposition of civil fines up to for each day of violation of the order plus exemplary damages up to three times the costs incurred by the mdeq if the subsidiary does not comply with the order 
the order may require the implementation of the remedial action plan although it is not clear on that point 
the order requires the implementation of emergency response action if a release of hazardous substances  threat of a release  or exacerbation of existing contamination occurs during the pendency of the order 
the subsidiary is evaluating its defenses to the allegations in the letter and to the order  including the defense that the consent decree entered into with the state previously resolved most of the claims now asserted by the state and which are the basis for much of the order 
it is not possible at this stage to determine the expenditures that may be required in connection with this matter 
the subsidiary has received some funds from an insurance carrier to reimburse it for work done by the subsidiary under the consent decree and will seek further coverage for the matters in the june  mdeq letter and the order 
the subsidiary  prior to the issuance of the order  sought a court order to enforce the consent decree but that relief was denied by the court  primarily on the basis that the action was premature since the state was not pursuing an enforcement action at the time 
the subsidiary has sought leave to appeal that decision to the michigan court of appeals

see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion regarding impairment and special charges recorded during fiscal and fiscal item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in thousands factors which may affect future results the company s future operating results and financial position may be adversely affected or fluctuate substantially on a quarterly basis as a result of continuing difficulties in the commercial aviation environment exacerbated by the september  terrorist attacks and the events that followed  the relatively weak worldwide economic climate and other factors  including decline in demand for the company s products and services and the ability of the company s customers to meet their financial obligations to the company  particularly in light of the weakened financial condition of many of the world s commercial airlines  the potential risk for declining market values for aviation products and equipment caused by various factors  including the bankruptcies of united airlines  us airways  inc  air canada  avianca  inc 
and hawaiian airlines  inc  possible future airline bankruptcies and other factors within the airline industry  difficulties in re leasing or selling aircraft and engines that are currently being leased on a long or short term basis  lack of assurance that sales to the us government  its agencies and its contractors which were of total sales in fiscal  will continue at levels previously experienced  since such sales are subject to competitive bidding and government funding  access to the debt and equity capital markets and the ability to draw down under financing agreements  which may be limited in light of industry conditions and company performance  changes in or noncompliance with laws and regulations that may affect certain of the company s aviation related activities that are subject to licensing  certification and other regulatory requirements imposed by the faa and other regulatory agencies  both domestic and foreign  competition from other companies  including original equipment manufacturers  some of which have greater financial resources than the company  exposure to product liability and property claims that may be in excess of the company s substantial liability insurance coverage  difficulties in being able to successfully integrate business acquisitions and the outcome of any pending or future material litigation or environmental proceedings 
critical accounting policies and significant estimates the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
management of the company has made estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities to prepare the consolidated financial statements 
the most significant estimates made by management of the company include adjustments to reduce the value of inventories and equipment on or available for lease  allowance for doubtful accounts and loss accruals for aviation equipment operating leases 
accordingly  actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
the following is a summary of the accounting policies considered critical by management of the company 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company s allowance for doubtful accounts is intended to reduce the value of customer accounts receivable to amounts expected to be collected 
in determining the required allowance  the company considers factors such as general and industry specific economic conditions  customer credit history  and the customer s current and expected future financial performance 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by the specific identification  average cost or first in  first out methods 
provisions are made for excess and obsolete inventories and inventories that have been impaired as a result of industry conditions 
the company has utilized certain assumptions when determining the market value of inventories  such as historical sales of inventory  current and expected future aviation usage trends  replacement val ues and expected future demand 
principally as a result of the terrorist attacks of september  and its anticipated impact on the global airline industry s financial condition  fleet size and aircraft utilization  the company recorded a significant charge for impaired inventories during the second quarter of fiscal utilizing those assumptions 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recorded an additional charge as a result of a further decline in market value for these inventories 
reductions in demand for certain of the company s inventories or declining market values  as well as differences between actual results and the assumptions utilized by the company when determining the market value of its inventories  could result in additional impairment charges in future periods 
equipment on or available for lease lease revenue is recognized as earned 
the cost of the asset under lease is original purchase price plus overhaul costs 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated service life of the equipment  and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred 
the balance sheet classification is based on the lease term  with fixed term leases less than twelve months classified as short term and all others classified as long term 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the company is required to test for impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows 
when applying the provisions of sfas no 
to equipment on or available for lease  the company has utilized certain assumptions when estimating future undiscounted cash flows  such as current and estimated future lease rates  estimated residual values and expected future demand 
differences between actual results and the assumptions utilized by the company when determining undiscounted cash flows could result in future impairments of equipment on or available for lease 
aviation equipment operating leases the company from time to time leases aviation equipment engines and aircraft from lessors under arrangements that are classified by the company as operating leases 
the company may also sublease the aviation equipment to a customer on a short or long term basis 
the terms of the operating leases in which the company is the lessee are one year with options to renew annually at the election of the company 
if the company elects not to renew a lease or the lease term expires  the company will purchase the equipment from the lessor at its scheduled purchase option price 
the terms of the lease agreements also allow the company to purchase the equipment at any time during a lease at its scheduled purchase option price 
in those instances in which the company anticipates that it will purchase aviation equipment and that the scheduled purchase option price will exceed estimated undiscounted cash flows related to the equipment  the company records an accrual for loss 
the company has utilized certain assumptions when estimating future undiscounted cash flows  such as current and estimated future lease rates  estimated residual values  and expected future demand 
differences between actual results and the assumptions utilized by the company when determining undiscounted cash flows could result in future provisions for losses on aviation equipment under operating leases 
results of operations the company reports its activities in four business segments inventory and logistic services  maintenance  repair and overhaul  manufacturing  and aircraft and engine sales and leasing 
sales in the inventory and logistic services segment are derived from the sale of a wide variety of new  overhauled and repaired engine and airframe parts and components to the commercial aviation and military markets  as well as the distribution of new airframe parts purchased from various original equipment manufacturers and sold to commercial and general aviation customers 
cost of sales consists principally of the cost of product primarily aircraft and engine parts and overhead primarily indirect labor  facility cost and insurance 
sales in the maintenance  repair and overhaul segment are derived from the repair and overhaul of a wide range of commercial and military aircraft engine and airframe parts  landing gear and components  aircraft maintenance and storage  and the repair  overhaul and sale of parts for industrial gas and steam turbine operators 
cost of sales consists principally of cost of product primarily replacement aircraft parts  direct labor and overhead 
sales in the manufacturing segment are derived from the manufacture and sale of a wide array of containers  pallets and shelters used to support the us military s tactical deployment requirements  in plane cargo loading and handling systems for commercial and military applications and advanced composite materials and components for aerospace and industrial use 
cost of sales consists principally of the cost of product  direct labor and overhead 
sales in the aircraft and engine sales and leasing segment are derived from the sale and lease of commercial aircraft and engines and technical and advisory services 
cost of sales consists principally of cost of product aircraft and engines  labor and the cost of lease revenue primarily depreciation  lease expense and insurance 
the table below sets forth consolidated sales for the company s four business segments for each of the last three fiscal years ended may for the year ended may  sales inventory and logistic services maintenance  repair and overhaul manufacturing aircraft and engine sales and leasing three year sales summary over the last three fiscal years  consolidated sales  excluding pass through sales  decreased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal and to  in fiscal total sales  which include pass through sales  declined from  in fiscal to  in fiscal and to  in fiscal the decline in sales over this three year period principally reflects the depressed state of the commercial airline environment  partially offset by increased sales to the us government and their contractors 
as a result of the events of september   which occurred at a time when the worldwide commercial airline environment was already under significant pressure principally due to weak worldwide economic conditions  most of the major us based commercial airlines announced substantial reductions in capacity  some in excess of 
commercial airlines accelerated their older generation aircraft fleet retirement plans 
the reduction in industry capacity and the financial impact of the events of september  on the company s commercial airline customers had a significant negative effect on the company s fiscal operating results as demand for the company s products and services within the inventory and logistic services  maintenance repair and overhaul and aircraft and engine sales and leasing segments declined dramatically when compared to fiscal during the first three quarters of fiscal  the company experienced sequential sales growth reflecting increased sales to the us government  its agencies and its contractors  as well as improved sales to commercial airline customers 
the increase in sales to the us government  its agencies and its contractors was driven by increased demand for manufactured products supporting the us military s deployment requirements and other spares and logistics support 
sales to many of the company s commercial airline customers improved during the first three quarters of fiscal as the company increased its investment in newer generation inventories and developed new repair capabilities 
however  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  demand for products and services from certain of the company s airline customers declined as a result of the war in iraq and the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars 
fiscal compared with fiscal consolidated sales for fiscal were  which represents a decrease of  or compared to fiscal in the inventory and logistic services segment  fiscal sales declined  or compared to fiscal the decrease in sales compared to the prior year was attributable to a  reduction in sales to general aviation customers as a result of management s decision to reduce its investment in the low margin general aviation market by eliminating most general aviation branch locations and reducing staff levels 
in the inventory and logistics services segment  the company experienced increased sales to the us military for spares and logistics support and higher sales of serviceable parts to certain program customers 
in the maintenance  repair and overhaul segment  fiscal sales declined  or compared to fiscal the decrease in sales compared to the prior year was attributable to lower sales in the us  partially offset by increased component overhaul sales in europe primarily due to favorable changes in currency translation rates 
in the manufacturing segment  fiscal sales increased  or as the company experienced record demand for the company s manufactured products which support the us military deployment activities 
increased shipments of the company s non aviation related composite structure products also contributed to higher sales within this segment 
in the aircraft and engine sales and leasing segment  fiscal sales declined  or 
sales in this segment are principally comprised of lease revenues from aircraft and engines on lease to operators  as well as sales of aircraft and engines 
sales in this segment remain historically low  reflecting the lack of sales activity caused by the aviation industry wide reduction in demand for capital assets post september  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recorded impairment charges related to certain engine and airframe parts and whole engines in the amount of  the fiscal impairment charge was based upon an updated assessment of the net realizable values for certain engine and airframe parts and future undiscounted cash flows for whole engines 
of the  impairment charge recorded during fiscal   was related to the inventory and logistic services segment and  related to the aircraft and engine sales and leasing segment 
consolidated gross profit  before consideration of impairment charges in fiscal and  decreased  or as a result of lower sales and a reduction in the consolidated gross profit margin from in fiscal to in fiscal the reduction in the consolidated gross profit margin was primarily attributable to lower margins experienced in the maintenance  repair and overhaul segment  as well as lower volume through most of the facilities within that segment  partially offset by an increase in the gross profit margin in the manufacturing segment due principally to increased volume and the mix of products sold 
including the effect of the impairment charges recorded in fiscal and  consolidated gross profit increased  operating income  before consideration of impairment and other special charges  decreased  as a result of lower sales and a reduction in the consolidated gross profit margin  partially offset by lower selling  general and administrative expenses 
during fiscal  the company reduced its selling  general and administrative expenses by  or principally as a result of lower personnel costs and reduced discretionary spending 
interest expense decreased compared to the prior year principally due to decreased average borrowings during fiscal interest income decreased  over the prior year due to a decline in average cash invested during the fiscal year and lower interest rates 
the company s effective tax benefit rate for fiscal was compared to in fiscal the fiscal income tax benefit includes a  reduction in income tax expense representing the reversal of federal income tax liabilities 
this adjustment reduced federal and state income tax expense primarily recorded during the fiscal years through  related to incentives on exports and tax credits 
a change in tax law effective in fiscal regarding the computation of export incentives  combined with previous experience with tax examinations  resulted in the reduction in the tax expense 
the company recorded a net loss of  during fiscal due to the factors discussed above 
fiscal compared with fiscal consolidated sales in fiscal  excluding pass through sales  decreased  or compared to fiscal as the company experienced lower sales in three of its four segments 
in the inventory and logistic services segment  fiscal sales declined  or primarily as a result of lower demand for engine and airframe parts from the company s customers due to reduced airline capacity  including the accelerated retirement of older generation aircraft  partially offset by increased sales of spares and logistics support for the us military and its contractors 
the decline in engine parts sales was also due to lower sales to a major program customer for certain engine parts due principally to the impact of the dissolution of the company s exclusive engine parts support agreement with this major customer  which occurred in december the elimination of pass through sales was also attributable to this factor 
in the maintenance  repair and overhaul segment  sales decreased  or primarily due to the reduction in airline capacity  partially offset by the favorable full year impact of sales of hermetic  which the company acquired on september  fiscal and revenues for hermetic included in consolidated sales were approximately  and  respectively 
in the manufacturing segment  sales increased  or as the company experienced increased shipments of products supporting the us military s tactical deployment requirements  partially offset by lower sales of the company s cargo loading systems 
sales in the aircraft and engine sales and leasing segment declined  or primarily due to the commercial aviation industry wide reduction in capital asset investment activity reflecting the difficult commercial airline environment  including lack of available financing and fluctuating market values for aircraft and engines 
prior to september  the company was executing its plan to reduce its investment in support of older generation aircraft in line with the commercial airlines scheduled retirement plans for these aircraft 
the events of september caused a severe and sudden disruption in the commercial airline industry  which brought about a rapid acceleration of those retirement plans 
system wide capacity had been reduced by approximately and many airlines cancelled or deferred new aircraft deliveries 
based on management s assessment of these and other conditions  the company reduced the value and provided loss accruals for certain of its inventories and equipment leases that support older generation aircraft by  during the three month period ended november  this charge is reflected on the consolidated statement of operations as cost of sales impairment charges 
in addition  the company recorded other charges of  during the three month period ended november  principally related to an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect its inability to recover certain accounts receivable 
this charge is reflected on the consolidated statement of operations as special charges 
consolidated gross profit before consideration of impairment charges decreased  or as a result of lower sales and a reduction in the consolidated gross profit margin 
the reduction in the consolidated gross profit margin was principally due to margin pressure experienced in the inventory and logistic services and maintenance  repair and overhaul segments  as well as lower volume through most of the facilities within those two segments 
the aircraft and engine sales and leasing segment s gross profit percentage increased over the prior year due to the mix of products sold 
operating income  before consideration of impairment and other special charges  decreased  from the prior year as a result of lower gross profit  partially offset by a reduction in selling  general and administrative expenses of  or through lower personnel costs and reduced discretionary spending 
interest expense decreased  over the prior year principally as a result of lower average short term borrowings outstanding during the year and interest income increased  over the prior year primarily as a result of an increase in average cash invested 
the company s effective income tax benefit rate for fiscal was and includes a  reduction in income tax expense representing the reversal of federal income tax liabilities 
this adjustment reduced federal and state income tax expense primarily recorded during the fiscal years through  related to incentives on exports and tax credits

the company also relies on its various secured credit arrangements  which include an accounts receivable securitization program and certain aviation equipment operating leases to provide additional liquidity 
the company s continuing ability to borrow from its lenders and issue debt and equity securities in the future may be negatively affected by a number of factors  including general economic conditions  airline and aviation industry conditions  company performance and geopolitical events  including the war on terrorism 
the company s ability to use its accounts receivable securitization program and aviation equipment operating leases is also dependent on those factors 
the company s ability to generate cash from operations is influenced primarily by the operating performance of the company and working capital management

at may   the company s ratio of long term debt to capitalization was  down from at may  and at may   the company s ratio of total debt to capitalization was compared to at may  the decrease in the long term debt to capitalization ratio compared to may  is primarily attributable to the classification of certain debt instruments to current during fiscal the increase in the total debt to capitalization ratio is primarily attributable to the non recourse debt recorded when the company purchased the equity interest in a joint venture see note of notes to consolidated financial statements
