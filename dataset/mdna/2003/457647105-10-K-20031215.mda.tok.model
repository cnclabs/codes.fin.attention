item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to those statements included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion may contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  such as those set forth under business risks related to our business and elsewhere in this report 
we utilize a fiscal year that ends on the saturday nearest to september for clarity of presentation  we have described all periods as if they end at the end of the calendar quarter 
overview we are a leading worldwide provider of flexible circuit interconnect solutions to original equipment manufacturers oems in the electronics industry 
we offer a full range of customized flexible circuit applications and services from initial design  development and prototype to fabrication  assembly and test on a global basis 
we target high volume markets where miniaturization  form and weight are driving factors and flexible circuits are an enabling technology 
applications for flexible circuits currently addressed by us include data storage devices such as hard disk drives hdds  liquid crystal displays lcds for mobile communication devices  tape drives and arrays  flat panel displays and printers 
our customers include m  dell  hitachi  hp  maxtor  medtronic  philips  quantum  sae magnetics a subsidiary of tdk  samsung  seagate  staktek  storagetek  xerox and other leading electronic oems 
prior to  our primary products were small lead wire assemblies for computer disk drives 
the disk drive industry has transitioned away from lead wire assembly interconnects to integrated interconnects such as our flex suspension assembly fsa products 
this transition has had a significant impact on our operations since as we have had to manage the rapid increase in our flexible circuit business while controlling the rapid drop in our lead wire assembly operations 
lead wire assembly sales constituted none of fiscal  and consolidated net sales after comprising over of fiscal net sales 
net sales and revenue recognition we manufacture flexible circuits and perform certain additional assembly and test functions on these flexible circuits based on customer specifications 
we sell our products directly throughout the world  primarily in north america  europe and the pacific rim countries 
we use non exclusive sales representatives to augment our direct sales efforts  with sales through distributors representing less than of our total net sales for fiscal years  and we recognize revenue from the sale of our products upon shipment or delivery of our product to our customers  depending on the customer agreement or shipping terms 
we store some inventory in third party owned warehouses that are located close to customers manufacturing facilities 
sales from third party warehouses are recognized upon the transfer of title and risk of loss  following the customer s acknowledgment of the receipt of the goods 
costs and expenses cost of sales consists primarily of material costs for raw materials and semi finished components used for assembly of our products  labor costs directly related to manufacture  assembly and inspection of our products  costs of general utilities  production supplies and chemicals consumed in the manufacturing processes  costs related to the maintenance of our manufacturing equipment and facilities  costs related to material and product handling and shipment  depreciation costs related to facilities  machinery and equipment used to manufacture  assemble and inspect our products  and salaries and overhead attributed to our supply chain  process engineering and manufacturing personnel 
selling  general and administrative expenses primarily consist of salaries and related selling commissions  travel  business development and program management  administrative  finance  human resources  regulatory  information services and executive personnel expenses  other significant expenses related to external accounting  software maintenance and legal and regulatory fees  and overhead attributed to our selling  general and administrative personnel 
engineering expenses include costs associated with the design  development and testing of our products and processes 
these costs consist primarily of salaries and related development personnel expenses  overhead attributed to our development and test engineering personnel  and prototyping costs related to the development of new products 
restructuring charges are those costs primarily related to manufacturing facility closures  severance and product discontinuations 
in fiscal  we closed our agua prieta  mexico facility and moved the operations to our facility in lamphun  thailand and recorded the associated restructuring charges 
in fiscal  we recorded restructuring charges related to closing our chandler  arizona facility and transferring manufacturing operations to our minnesota and thailand locations 
because we initially underestimated the costs relating to these restructurings  we recorded additional restructuring charges in fiscal and and in our current fiscal year 
as of september   we believe that the restructuring related to the closing of these two facilities has been substantially completed 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain operating data as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated for the years ended september  net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative engineering restructuring total operating expenses income loss from operations net interest and other expense income loss before provision for income taxes benefit provision for income taxes net income loss comparison of the fiscal years ended september  and net sales our net sales were million for the year ended september   compared to million for the year ended september   an increase of 
our net sales from operations were million in the fourth quarter of fiscal  compared to million in the fourth quarter of fiscal  an increase of 
these increases were due to higher sales generated by disk drive  semiconductor packaging and lcd display applications 
the increased disk drive sales were related to our improved fsa market share as our largest customer in the disk drive industry transitioned to the gigabyte gb per platter technology platform 
semiconductor packaging net sales increased due to higher demand from our stacked memory customers 
the lcd sales improvement was related to the continued ramp up of the new lcd program announced during the first quarter of fiscal sales from the disk drive industry generated of our net sales for the year ended september   compared to for the year ended september   sales from semiconductor packaging applications were  compared to  network system application sales were for both years  display application net sales were versus  consumer application sales were versus and sales from other industry applications were for the year ended september  versus for the year ended september  we expect net sales for fiscal to improve as we continue to benefit from the qualification of our fsa product on gb per platter disk drive programs  additional program qualifications for our disk drive actuator flex products  increases in demand for our stacked memory flex product and additional lcd flex programs enter production 
gross profit our gross profit was million for the fiscal year ended september   compared to million for the fiscal year ended september   an increase of 
our gross margin for the fiscal year ended september  increased to  compared to for the fiscal year ended september  the increase in gross margin was primarily due to higher net sales increasing our fixed cost leverage and efficiency improvements related to six sigma and other initiatives 
these improvements offset the incremental start up and tooling costs related to new product introductions and product mix changes resulting from a lower portion of sales from hif  one of our older products  within our product mix that impacted the first half of fiscal we experienced a significant product transition during the second quarter of fiscal  converting approximately of our products to new designs 
the product mix for the first half of fiscal also had an increased share of fsa sales with higher material pass through content related to the suspension material used in the fsa product 
the fiscal product mix included a higher share of our hif product  which does not include the suspension related pass through material 
we anticipate that gross margins in fiscal will improve as net sales are expected to increase and the efficiency improvements benefiting the fourth quarter of fiscal continue to have a positive impact 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended september  were million  compared to million in the fiscal year ended september   an increase of 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were for both the fiscal year ended september  and the increase in fiscal spending was primarily due to increased commissions and royalties resulting from the increase in net sales  consulting and training costs related to implementation of the company wide six sigma program and severance costs of approximately  recorded during the first quarter of fiscal related to efforts to increase operational efficiency by consolidating from four marketing groups to three 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal are expected to decrease as a percentage of net sales due to a reduced level of six sigma spending and anticipated increased net sales in fiscal engineering engineering expenses for the fiscal year ended september  were million  compared to million for the fiscal year ended september   an increase of 
the increase in fiscal engineering expenses was primarily due to increased spending on new product development  further spending related to fsa and fgsa technology improvements  qualifying products and processes for new applications including lcd displays  printers  semiconductor packaging substrates and other high end flexible circuit technology development related to new products 
as a percentage of net sales  engineering expenses were of sales for both the fiscal year ended september  and engineering expenses for fiscal are expected to decrease as a percentage of net sales due to an expected increase in sales while engineering expenses are expected to remain flat 
restructuring restructuring charges for the fiscal year ended september  were  compared to  for the fiscal year ended september  in fiscal  the charges were recorded due to an increase in the estimate of the leased chandler  arizona facility disposition costs  primarily to buy out the remainder of the chandler  arizona facility lease through its june termination 
in the fiscal year ended september   the charges were also recorded due to an increase in the estimate of the leased chandler  arizona facility disposition costs and an additional accrual was recorded to complete the restructuring related to the closing of our mexican facility 
as of september   the restructuring was substantially complete 
net interest and other expense net interest expenses were million in the fiscal year ended september   compared to million for the fiscal year ended september   a decrease of 
interest expense decreased in primarily due to average interest bearing debt being million lower for the twelve months ended september  compared to the twelve months ended september  net other expense was  in the fiscal year ended september  as compared to net other income of  in the fiscal year ended september  the decrease was the result of foreign currency exchange losses being incurred in fiscal while a foreign currency gain was generated in fiscal and the write off of the loan origination fees related to the us based credit facility which was paid off in the fourth quarter of fiscal income taxes income tax benefit for the fiscal year ended september  was million  compared to million for the fiscal year ended september  the fiscal tax benefit was calculated as the change in the deferred tax asset from we have determined that it is more likely than not that we will be able to utilize the tax benefit in the future 
during the second quarter of fiscal  approximately million of the tax benefit recorded was due to a reduction of the deferred tax allowance 
the deferred tax allowance was reduced as a result of the estimated improvement in deferred tax asset recoverability in light of the receipt of a million tax refund resulting from the carry back of the fiscal net operating loss 
comparison of the fiscal years ended september  and net sales our net sales were million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  a decrease of 
the largest portion of the decline was due to a reduction in flexible circuit sales for high end tape library  tape backup and array applications as a result of lower worldwide information technology infrastructure spending 
in addition  fiscal did not include any sales of our bridge flex product as the product was phased out in early fiscal the bridge flex was a transitional product that completed the connection from the suspension to the actuator flex for disk drive head interconnect solutions that terminated at the back of the suspension 
the need for bridge flex products was eliminated as the conductors from subsequent versions of these disk drive head interconnect solutions extended beyond the suspension 
in fiscal  we also experienced a continued decline in flexible circuit sales from mobile communications devices as the telecommunications market continued to be less active 
the decline in sales was partially offset through increased sales in other areas including disk drive actuator flex  dvd  semiconductor packaging and solid ink printer applications 
sales from disk drive actuator flex products increased as the result of market share gains 
dvd related sales increased due to a customer s new product introduction 
semiconductor packaging sales improved as a result of increased demand for stacked memory for high end server applications 
our sales from the disk drive industry generated of fiscal net sales compared to in fiscal consumer application sales were of net sales in fiscal as compared to in fiscal due to dvd and solid ink printer sales increases 
sales generated from network system applications were in fiscal down from in fiscal due to the decrease in tape storage related sales 
sales from other applications were in fiscal compared to in fiscal gross profit our gross profit was million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal  a decrease of 
however  our gross margin for fiscal increased slightly to  from the reported for fiscal the improved gross margin percentage was primarily due to a lower fixed cost basis resulting from cost reduction measures we took in fiscal this cost reduction was partially offset by lower fixed cost leverage caused by the reduction in sales 
the cost reduction measures included the transfer of manufacturing operations from chandler  arizona to our minnesota and thailand facilities and a reduction of our workforce 
the benefit of the lower cost base was also partially offset by an increase in variable material costs caused by an increased proportion of fsa products in the product mix 
fsa products have a higher variable material cost component than products including only flexible circuits due to the cost of the purchased suspension to which the flexible circuit is attached 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  a decrease of 
the decrease in fiscal expenses was a result of the fiscal restructuring that closed our chandler  arizona facility and reduced our overall workforce size combined with general cost cutting measures 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were for the fiscal year ended september  as compared to for the prior year 
engineering engineering expenses were million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  a decrease of 
the decline in our fiscal expenses was partially a result of a reduced workforce related to the fiscal restructuring that closed our chandler  arizona facility 
engineering expenses were of sales for the fiscal year ended september   unchanged from the prior year 
fiscal engineering expenses were focused on manufacturing process improvements  further fsa and fgsa technology improvements  qualifying products and processes for new applications including lcd displays  printers  semiconductor packaging substrates and other high end flexible circuit technology development related to new products 
restructuring restructuring and asset impairment charges for fiscal were  compared to million in fiscal in fiscal the charges were recorded due to an increase in the estimate of the leased chandler  arizona facility disposition costs and for costs to complete the disposal of the agua prieta  mexico facility 
the fiscal costs included asset impairment and restructuring charges of million and million related to the restructuring of our manufacturing operations 
the restructuring was related to closing our chandler  arizona facility and moving manufacturing operations to our minnesota and thailand locations 
the charges included approximately million related to asset impairment of property and equipment and million for the impairment of the remaining unamortized balance of the goodwill recorded at the time of our september acquisition of adflex solutions  inc the charge also includes million of inventory write offs related to discontinued product lines  accrued liabilities of million for employee severance and benefits and million for facility abandonment costs 
the restructuring was substantially complete as of september  with the exception of the costs accrued to maintain the leased chandler facility until its disposition 
the fiscal costs also included a  charge relating to an increase in the estimate of the facility abandonment charges relating to the length of time required to complete the disposition of our facility located in agua prieta  mexico 
the facility was sold during the fiscal second quarter 
net interest and other expense net interest expenses were million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal  a decrease of 
the net interest decrease in fiscal was due to lower interest rates on our us based debt facilities which have floating interest rates and the reduction in interest bearing debt by over million during fiscal fiscal net other income of  was primarily income from our investment in applied kinetics  inc aki 
net other expense in fiscal of  was primarily due to increased foreign currency transaction costs as a result of the high level of sales recorded in thailand baht and foreign currency translation losses related to the volatility of the thailand baht us dollar relationship during the year 
income taxes the income tax benefit for fiscal was million reflecting an effective tax rate of 
the effective tax benefit rate was higher than the statutory federal rate primarily due to the exclusion of income generated from our foreign operating corporation and a reduction in our deferred tax allowance 
the deferred tax allowance was reduced as a result of the estimated improvement in deferred tax asset recoverability in light of the receipt of a million tax refund resulting from the carry back of the fiscal net operating loss 
the carry back was allowed as part of the economic relief act that was passed into law during the second quarter of fiscal the fiscal income tax benefit was million  resulting in an effective tax rate of 
the effective tax benefit rate was lower than the statutory federal rate primarily due to an increase in the deferred tax allowance 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  sales and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  estimates are evaluated based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we apply the following critical accounting policies in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements allowance for excess and obsolete inventory 
inventories  which are composed of raw materials  work in process and finished goods  are valued at the lower of cost or market with cost being determined by the first in  first out method 
on a periodic basis  we analyze the level of inventory on hand  our cost in relation to market value and estimated customer requirements to determine whether write downs for excess or obsolete inventory are required 
actual customer requirements in any future periods are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from estimates 
if actual or expected requirements were significantly different than the established reserves  a revision to the obsolescence allowance would be recorded in the period in which such a determination was made 
goodwill 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standards  goodwill and intangible assets effective october  and as a result discontinued the amortization of goodwill and any other intangible assets determined to have indefinite lives 
we have determined goodwill relates to one reporting unit for purposes of impairment testing 
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment annually or whenever an impairment indicator arises 
if events or circumstances change  including reductions in anticipated cash flows generated by operations  goodwill could become impaired and result in a charge to earnings 
deferred taxes 
we account for income taxes using the liability method 
deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
a valuation allowance is set up where the realization of any deferred taxes becomes less likely than not to occur 
we analyze the valuation allowance periodically which may result in income tax expense being different than statutory rates 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our operations primarily through cash from operating activities  bank credit facilities and employee stock option exercises 
cash and equivalents were million at september  and million at september  net cash provided by operating activities was million in the fiscal year ended september   compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million in the fiscal year ended september  for the fiscal year ended september   net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to non cash charges for restructuring and depreciation more than offsetting the pre tax loss for the period and the increase in accounts receivable at september  from september  as a result of the increased level of sales at the end of september  net cash provided by operating activities was also benefited from an increase in accounts payable for the same period as a result of the increased manufacturing activity levels and by decreases in inventory and the receipt of a tax refund 
a decrease in accrued liabilities resulting from the payment of accrued restructuring charges during the period reduced the net cash provided by operating activities 
for fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the receipt of a million tax refund and non cash charges for depreciation and deferred tax benefits more than offsetting the net loss for the period 
net cash provided by operating activities was also benefited by decreases in inventory and accounts receivable more than offsetting a decrease in accounts payable for the period 
a decrease in accrued liabilities resulting from the payment of accrued restructuring charges during the period significantly reduced the net cash provided by operating activities 
for fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to non cash charges for restructuring  depreciation and deferred tax benefits more than offsetting the net loss for the period 
net cash provided by operating activities was also benefited by decreases in inventory and accounts receivable more than offsetting a decrease in accounts payable for the period 
a decrease in accrued liabilities resulting from the payment of accrued restructuring charges during the period significantly reduced the net cash provided by operating activities 
net cash used in investing activities was million in the fiscal year ended september   compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal in the fiscal year ended september   net cash used in investing activities was attributed to the purchase of test equipment and equipment to expand capacity in selected areas 
fiscal net cash used in investing activities was due to capital expenditures of million being partially offset by proceeds from the sale of our mexican facility 
fiscal capital expenditures primarily included technological upgrades  selected capacity increases and facility improvements 
fiscal net cash used in investing activities was primarily related to capital expenditures for additional fsa attachment equipment and the minnesota and thailand facility additions related to the move of operations from arizona to minnesota and thailand 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in the fiscal year ended september   compared to net cash used in financing activities of million in fiscal and net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal during the fiscal year ended september   net cash provided by financing activities was primarily the result of net proceeds from a follow on stock offering of million partially offset by the pay down of interest bearing debt 
fiscal net cash used by financing activities was due to reductions in the outstanding balances under our thailand packing credit facilities  scheduled payments under our us and thailand long term credit facilities and an additional million payment made under our us long term credit facility 
fiscal net cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to proceeds from our new thailand long and short term credit facilities more than offsetting scheduled payments made under our us based credit facilities 
in april  we entered into a billion thailand baht approximately million credit facility agreement with bank of ayudhya public company limited and the industrial finance corporation of thailand 
the facility is comprised of a million baht long term facility  a million baht packing credit facility  a million baht short term working capital facility and a million baht overdraft facility 
the thailand based facility is secured by certain receivables  inventory and assets held by us in thailand 
in june  we completed a million thailand baht approximately million expansion of our thailand credit facilities also secured by certain receivables and inventory held by us in thailand 
in february  we completed a million baht approximately million expansion of our thailand credit facilities  increased our working capital facility by million baht and reduced our packing credit facility by million baht 
the new long term debt is secured by specified equipment held by innovex thailand  our wholly owned subsidiary 
as of september  we had approximately million outstanding under our thailand credit facilities 
on august   the entire remaining balance of a credit facility with wells fargo commercial bank was paid off 
there are no remaining obligations under this facility 
we are currently in compliance with covenants under our thailand based financing agreements 
we believe that with the existing us and thailand credit facilities  cash generated from operations and the proceeds from a stock offering received on august   we will have adequate funds to support projected working capital and capital expenditures for the next twenty four months 
we are considering alternatives for generating additional working capital and long term financing and will continue to pursue financing opportunities to better leverage our assets 
our financing needs and the financing alternatives available to us are subject to change depending on  among other things  general economic and market conditions  changes in industry buying patterns  customer acceptance of our fsa  actuator flex  stacked memory flex and display flex products and cash flow from operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas clarifies the accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
we adopted this statement effective in january  which did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
effective for the period ended march   we adopted sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas amends the disclosure and certain transition provisions of statement  accounting for stock based compensation 
the disclosure requirements of this pronouncement are included in our consolidated financial statements for the period ended september  in may  the fasb issued statement  accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
statement changes the statement of financial position classification of certain financial instruments from either equity or mezzanine presentation to liabilities and requires an issuer of those financial statements to recognize changes in fair value or redemption amount  as applicable  in earnings 
sfas is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after december  adoption of statement is not anticipated to have an impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin addresses the disclosure requirements of a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
fin also requires a guarantor to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the disclosure requirements of fin were effective for the company beginning with its quarter ended december  the liability recognition requirements will be applicable prospectively to all guarantees issued or modified after december  this pronouncement did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
forward looking statements statements included in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  elsewhere in this report and in future filings by the company with the sec  except for the historical information contained herein and therein  are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
these risks and uncertainties are set forth under business risks related to our business in this annual report and include the timely availability and acceptance of new products including the fgsa  lcd flexible circuits and semiconductor packaging substrates  the impact of competitive products and pricing  interruptions in the operations of the company s single source suppliers  changes in manufacturing efficiencies and other risks detailed from time to time in the company s reports filed with the securities and exchange commission 
in addition  a significant portion of the company s revenue is generated from the disk drive  integrated circuit substrates  consumer electronics and data storage industries and the global economic downturn has had and a continued economic downturn will continue to have an adverse impact on the company s operations 
the company disclaims any obligation subsequently to revise any forward looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances or the occurrence of unanticipated events 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the following discusses our exposure to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
while we transact business predominately in us dollars a portion of our sales and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies 
changes in the relation of foreign currencies to the us dollar will affect our cost of sales and operating margins and could result in exchange gains or losses 
to reduce the impact of certain foreign currency fluctuations  we enter into short term forward foreign currency exchange contracts in the regular course of business to manage our risk exposure  not as speculative instruments 
typically  these contracts have maturities of months or less 
the forward exchange contracts generally require us to exchange thailand baht for us dollars or us dollars for thailand baht at maturity  at rates agreed to at inception of the contracts 
these contracts are not designated as hedges  therefore  the gains and losses on foreign currency transactions are included in income 
we periodically review the outlook for expected currency exchange rate movements as well as the policy on desired future foreign currency cash flow positions long  short or balanced for those currencies in which we have significant activity 
expected future cash flow positions and strategies are continuously monitored 
at september   we had open forward exchange contracts to buy thailand baht maturing october  with a notional amount of million thailand baht  approximately million and contracts to buy thailand baht maturing january  with a notional amount of million baht  approximately million 
no assurance can be given that our strategies will prevent future currency fluctuations from adversely affecting our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are exposed to interest rate risk as a large portion of our interest bearing debt is subject to interest rates which fluctuate with changes in market interest rates or are periodically reset based on market interest rates 
a large change in market interest rates could have an adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations
