strategic actions in november  alliant energy s board of directors approved five strategic actions designed to maintain a strong credit profile for alliant energy  strengthen its balance sheet and position alliant energy for improved long term financial performance 
the five strategic actions  which signaled a shift to less aggressive growth targets driven primarily by alliant energy s utility operations  included a commitment to pursue the sale of  or other exit strategies for  a number of non regulated businesses  including alliant energy s oil and gas whiting  australian including southern hydro and affordable housing businesses 
for accounting purposes  such businesses have been classified as available for sale  and the operating results of these businesses have been separately classified and reported as discontinued operations  in alliant energy s consolidated financial statements 
alliant energy anticipates strengthening its liquidity position by up to million to billion from reductions in consolidated debt and increasing its cash and temporary cash investment balances as a result of these transactions 
the amount of proceeds ultimately received from these divestitures  and the timing of the completion of the transactions  are subject to a variety of factors  including the transaction structures alliant energy utilizes to exit these businesses 
in january  alliant energy also decided to sell smartenergy which was classified as held and used  and its operating results were included in continuing operations  in alliant energy s consolidated financial statements 
refer to note of alliant energy s notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
a reduction in alliant energy s targeted annual common stock divided from per share to per share  effective with the dividend declared and paid in the first quarter of reductions in alliant energy s aggregated anticipated and construction and acquisition expenditures by approximately million 
a plan to raise approximately to million of common equity in  dependent on market conditions 
alliant energy expects to direct the majority of the proceeds towards additional capital investments in its regulated domestic utilities 
the implementation of additional cost control measures to be accomplished through alliant energy s new six sigma program  the operation of its new enterprise resource planning system that was placed in service in october and by a heightened focus on operating its domestic utility business in a manner that aligns operating expenses with the revenues granted in its various rate filings 
alliant energy is continuing in its efforts to implement these strategic actions 
refer to other matters other future considerations asset sales for discussion of an agreement alliant energy recently entered into related to the sale of its australian business 
rates and regulatory matters overview alliant energy has two primary utility subsidiaries  ip l and wp l 
ip l was formed as a result of the merger of ipc with and into iesu effective jan 
 wp l has one utility subsidiary  south beloit 
as a public utility holding company with significant utility assets  alliant energy competes in an ever changing utility industry 
electric energy generation  transmission and distribution are in a period of fundamental change resulting from legislative  regulatory  economic and technological changes 
these changes impact competition in the electric wholesale and retail markets as customers of electric utilities are being offered alternative suppliers 
such competitive pressures could result in electric utilities losing customers and incurring stranded costs ie  assets and other costs rendered unrecoverable as the result of competitive pricing  which would be borne by security holders if the costs cannot be recovered from customers 
alliant energy s utility subsidiaries are currently subject to regulation by ferc  and state regulation in iowa  wisconsin  minnesota and illinois 
ferc regulates competition in the electric wholesale power generation market and each state regulates whether to permit retail competition  the terms of such retail competition and the recovery of any portion of stranded costs that are ultimately determined to have resulted from retail competition 
alliant energy cannot predict the timing of a restructured electric industry or the impact on its financial condition or results of operations but does believe it is well positioned to compete in a deregulated competitive market 
although alliant energy ultimately believes that the electric industry will be deregulated  the pace of deregulation in its primary retail electric service territories has been delayed due to more recent developments in the industry 
certain recent developments in july  ferc issued a notice of proposed rules intended to standardize the wholesale electric market  which has generated significant industry discussion 
although alliant energy believes that standardization of the wholesale electric market is appropriate and would benefit market participants  there may be significant changes to the proposed rules before they are adopted 
therefore  alliant energy cannot determine the impact the final rules will have on its results of operations or financial condition 
alliant energy s merger related price freezes expired in april in all of its primary domestic utility jurisdictions and it is currently addressing the recovery of its utility cost increases through numerous rate filings 
wp l has received final orders in two of its rate cases and ip l and wp l currently have four other rate cases pending 
details of these rate cases are as follows dollars in millions expected interim interim final final final utility filing increase increase effective increase effective effective case type date requested granted date granted date date notes wp l retail e g w aug

tbd tbd july total interim rate relief is implemented  subject to refund  pending determination of final rates 
in its september final order  the pscw increased the authorized return on common equity from to 
in the fourth quarter of  wp l reached a settlement agreement with certain wholesale customers for an annual increase of million and a refund of amounts previously collected in excess of the settlement 
the settlement agreement was approved by ferc in january at dec 
  wp l had reserved all amounts related to the anticipated refund 
in accordance with the interim rate relief rules in iowa  ip l only requested interim rate relief of million 
a significant portion of the rate increases included in the previous table reflect the recovery of anticipated increased costs incurred by ip l and wp l  or costs they expect to incur  thus the increase in revenues related to these cost increases would not result in a corresponding increase in income 
ip l  wp l and south beloit are currently in the process of determining what other rate case filings may be necessary in wp l s retail electric rates are based on annual forecasted fuel and purchased power costs 
under pscw rules  wp l can seek emergency rate increases if the annual costs are more than higher than the estimated costs used to establish rates 
for and  any collections in excess of costs incurred must be refunded  with interest 
accordingly  wp l has established a reserve due to overcollection of past fuel and purchased power costs and expects to refund such amount in the final ruling from the pscw could result in an increase or decrease to the reserve that has been recorded 
the pscw has issued new rules relating to the collection of fuel and purchased power costs by wisconsin utilities  including wp l 
the new rules and related procedures are intended  among other things  to significantly reduce regulatory lag for the utilities and customers related to the timing of the recovery of increased or decreased fuel and purchased power costs 
purchased power capacity costs will now be included in base rates 
a process will also exist whereby the utilities can seek deferral treatment of capacity  transmission and emergency costs between base rate cases 
the new rules are expected to be implemented for wp l with its pending retail rate case 
in  ip l filed with the irs for a change in method of accounting for tax purposes for through that would allow a current deduction related to mixed service costs 
such costs had previously been capitalized and depreciated for tax purposes over the appropriate tax lives 
this change would create a significant current tax benefit which has not been reflected in ip l s results of operations pending a decision from the iub on the required rate making treatment of the benefit 
there would be no material negative impact on ip l s results of operations or financial position should the iub and or irs reject ip l s proposal 
alliant energy results of operations unless otherwise noted  all per share references in the results of operations section refer to earnings per diluted share 
refer to note a of alliant energy s notes to consolidated financial statements for discussion of the various components of alliant energy s business 
alliant energy overview alliant energy s eps for  and were as follows income from continuing operations income from discontinued operations cumulative effect of changes in accounting principle net income income from continuing operations in and included per share and per share  respectively  of valuation charges incurred in its non regulated businesses 
income from continuing operations in included per share of non cash income related to alliant energy s adoption of sfas in addition to the higher valuation charges  the lower income from continuing operations was primarily the result of lower earnings from alliant energy s non regulated businesses 
this was primarily due to a net loss of million from alliant energy s brazil investments in  compared to a net loss of million in  lower earnings from alliant energy s mass marketing business and higher interest expense 
improved results from alliant energy s china and new zealand businesses partially offset the lower non regulated results 
income from alliant energy s domestic utility business increased slightly in as higher electric and gas margins were largely offset by increased operating expenses and a higher effective income tax rate 
domestic electric utility margins electric margins and mwh sales for alliant energy were as follows in thousands revenues and costs mwhs sold residential       commercial       industrial       total from ultimate customers       sales for resale       other    total revenues sales       electric production fuels expense    purchased power expense    margin    reflects the percent change from to reflects the percent change from to to comply with ferc regulatory requirements governing transmission systems  wp l transferred its transmission assets to atc on jan 
  in exchange for cash and an equity ownership in atc 
the wheeling expenses from atc included in electric margin in and were offset by equity income wp l accounts for its investment in atc under the equity method  reduced other operation and maintenance expenses and lower depreciation expense  resulting in no significant net income impact due to the formation of atc 
on a comparable basis  electric margin increased million  or  and million  or  for and  respectively 
the increase was primarily due to the impact of rate increases implemented in  more favorable weather conditions  lower purchased power and fuel costs and continued modest retail customer growth 
these increases were partially offset by reduced energy conservation revenues which were largely offset by lower energy conservation expense and the impact of a sluggish economy 
the increase was primarily due to lower purchased power and fuel costs impacting margin  increased residential and commercial sales due to more favorable weather conditions in compared to and continued retail customer growth 
these items were partially offset by million of income recorded in for a change in estimate of wp l s utility services rendered but unbilled at month end due to the implementation of a refined estimation process and lower industrial sales  largely due to impacts of a slowing economy 
gas utility margins gas margins and dth sales for alliant energy were as follows in thousands revenues and costs dths sold residential       commercial       industrial       transportation other       total revenues sales       cost of utility gas sold    margin    reflects the percent change from to reflects the percent change from to gas revenues and cost of utility gas sold were unusually high in due to increased natural gas prices in the first half of due to alliant energy s rate recovery mechanisms for gas costs  these price differences alone had little impact on gas margin 
gas margin increased million  or  and decreased million  or  for and  respectively 
the increase was largely due to the impact of several rate increases implemented in  improved results from wp l s performance based commodity cost recovery program which are shared by ratepayers and shareowners  continued modest retail customer growth and the negative impact high gas prices in early had on gas consumption during that period 
these increases were partially offset by reduced energy conservation revenues which were largely offset by lower energy conservation expenses 
the decrease was largely due to lower retail sales primarily related to the unusually high gas prices in early as some customers either chose alternative fuel sources or used less natural gas  the impact of the slowing economy and losses associated with performance based commodity costs at wp l 
alliant energy realized pre tax income of  million and million from weather hedges it had in place in  and  respectively  which is recorded in miscellaneous  net in the consolidated statements of income

refer to note of alliant energy s notes to consolidated financial statements and rates and regulatory matters for discussion of various rate filings 
non regulated and other revenues details regarding alliant energy s non regulated and other revenues are as follows in millions integrated services international mass marketing investments other includes eliminations the integrated services increase was primarily due to higher natural gas sales  partially offset by decreased gas prices and lower energy services revenues 
the increased international revenues for were primarily due to the acquisitions of additional combined heat and power facilities in china 
mass marketing revenues for increased due to the fourth quarter acquisition of a controlling interest in smartenergy  an energy services company operating in competitive energy markets 
the integrated services increase was primarily due to acquisitions in the third and fourth quarters of of various energy services businesses 
the international increase resulted from the december change from the equity method of accounting to the consolidation method for an investment in china and the addition of five combined heat and power facilities to alliant energy s china portfolio during the fifteen months prior to dec 
 other operating expenses other operation and maintenance expenses were as follows in millions utility integrated services international mass marketing investments other includes eliminations the utility increase was primarily due to increased fossil and nuclear generation  employee benefit and energy delivery expenses  partially offset by lower energy conservation expenses and decreased uncollectible customer account balances 
alliant energy is addressing these cost increases in various utility rate proceedings that are currently pending 
the utility increase was primarily due to higher transmission wheeling and other costs in alliant energy s energy delivery business unit  increased nuclear operating costs partially due to a planned refueling outage at kewaunee in  higher uncollectible customer account balances largely due to the unusually high gas prices earlier in the year and higher costs in the generation business unit 
these increases were partially offset by the impact of the formation of atc earlier in  as discussed in domestic electric utility margins 
the integrated services  international and mass marketing variances were largely driven by the same factors impacting the revenue variances discussed previously 
the mass marketing increase was also impacted by increases in the provisions for uncollectible accounts at smartenergy in charges of million and million are included in other in and  respectively  for cancelled generation projects in alliant energy s non regulated generation business unit 
the integrated services increase was partially offset by a one time charge of million related to a loss on a contract in depreciation and amortization expense increased million and million in and  respectively 
contributing to both increases were utility property additions  acquisitions at the non regulated businesses and increased regulatory and software amortizations 
increased earnings on the wp l nuclear decommissioning trust fund also contributed to the increase 
the increase was partially offset by lower expenses due to a decrease of million from implementation of lower depreciation rates at ip l on jan 
  resulting from an updated depreciation study  lower decommissioning expense based on reduced retail funding levels at wp l  and the elimination of million of goodwill amortization expense in compliance with new accounting rules effective in the increase was partially offset by the impact of the formation of atc in  as discussed in domestic electric utility margins  and lower earnings on the wp l nuclear decommissioning trust fund 
the accounting for earnings on the nuclear decommissioning trust fund results in no net income impact 
miscellaneous  net income increases for earnings on the trust fund and the corresponding offset is recorded through depreciation expense at wp l 
taxes other than income taxes increased million and million in and  respectively  primarily due to increased property taxes in and increased gross receipts and payroll taxes in interest expense and other interest expense increased million and million in and  respectively 
both increases were impacted by higher non regulated borrowings  partially offset by the impact of lower interest rates on alliant energy s variable rate borrowings 
the increase was also partially offset by lower short term debt borrowings at the alliant energy parent level  largely due to the impact of proceeds received in november from a common equity offering 
alliant energy recorded income tax and associated interest income of per share in related to a ruling in a tax refund case 
the federal government decided in the fourth quarter of not to pursue the ruling in favor of alliant energy by the us court of appeals for the th circuit dealing with capital losses disallowed under audit by the irs and certain related deductions 
an additional potential refund of approximately million  plus interest  remains a contested issue in this case 
alliant energy cannot offer any assurance it will be successful in obtaining this additional refund and has not recognized any income for the potential additional refund 
equity income loss from alliant energy s unconsolidated investments was as follows in millions atc began operations new zealand china cargill alliant sold in synfuel began operations brazil other majority of investments are accounted for under the consolidation method 
equity income from unconsolidated investments decreased million in the differences in income from new zealand during the three years were largely due to the results being depressed because of drought conditions 
the lower earnings in and at cargill alliant were impacted by fewer weather related trading opportunities and less volatile market prices 
refer to liquidity and capital resources sales of non strategic assets for discussion relating to alliant energy s sale of this investment in in the second quarter of  synfuel  a direct subsidiary of resources  purchased an equity interest in a synthetic fuel processing facility 
the synthetic fuel project generates operating losses at its fuel processing facility  which are more than offset by tax credits and the tax benefit of the losses the project generates 
all tax benefits are included in income taxes in alliant energy s consolidated statements of income 
the lower results from the brazil investments were largely due to losses incurred by alliant energy s investment in a gas fired generating plant  charges incurred in related to the recovery of the impacts of rationing and other prior costs and higher interest expense 
the loss from the generating plant was due to the impact of a significant decline in the currency rates associated with the debt issued to finance the plant and a depressed wholesale energy market in increased electric sales volumes in compared to  largely due to the impacts of the drought driven rationing program that was in place for approximately seven months in compared to only two months in  partially offset the lower brazil earnings 
the brazil results included a charge related to the impacts of a settlement reached between the brazilian government and the distribution companies on the economic resolution of various cost recovery issues 
refer to note of alliant energy s notes to consolidated financial statements for discussion of the asset valuation charges recorded by alliant energy in related to its mcleod available for sale securities 
on july   alliant energy adopted sfas for its consolidated entities 
related to the adoption  alliant energy recorded a million pre tax gain from the designation of a portion of alliant energy s mcleod holdings as trading securities 
this gain related to the unrealized appreciation in value of approximately of alliant energy s mcleod holdings that were designated as trading as of the adoption date 
miscellaneous  net income decreased million and million in and  respectively 
the decrease was due to the recording of pre tax asset valuation charges of million and million related to alliant energy s energy technologies and enermetrix investments  respectively  lower interest income the results included million from tax settlements  a pre tax goodwill impairment charge of million at smartenergy and gains from asset sales realized in these decreases were partially offset by lower pre tax  non cash sfas valuation charges of million  related to the net change in the value of the mcleod trading securities and the derivative component of resources exchangeable senior notes  and increased earnings on wp l s nuclear decommissioning trust fund 
the decrease was largely due to higher pre tax  non cash sfas valuation charges of million related to the net change in the value of the mcleod trading securities and the derivative component of resources exchangeable senior notes  reduced nuclear decommissioning trust fund earnings and lower gains from asset sales

income taxes the effective income tax rates for alliant energy s continuing operations were  and in  and  respectively 
refer to note of alliant energy s notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
income from discontinued operations the decrease of million in income from discontinued operations was largely due to lower earnings from alliant energy s oil and gas whiting business due to lower prices  higher operating expenses and lower gains from dispositions of oil and gas properties in compared to tax adjustments recorded in related to alliant energy s decision to sell its australian southern hydro and affordable housing businesses also contributed to the lower income 
the decrease was partially offset by higher oil and gas sales volumes at whiting and higher earnings from southern hydro due to increased generation and sales of renewable energy credits earned through the generation of hydropower 
the increase in income was largely due to non cash sfas income in related to the valuation of electricity derivatives at southern hydro and higher earnings from whiting which resulted from higher gas prices earlier in  increased oil and gas sales volumes and income from a reduction in the estimated dismantlement cost of an offshore oil and gas platform 
the increase was partially offset by approximately million of income from gains on the sale of million shares of mcleod in by alliant energy s affordable housing business

liquidity and capital resources overview alliant energy s recent and proposed financing activities have been and will be undertaken against a backdrop of increased market concerns about general economic conditions and corporate governance issues as well as risks associated with particular sectors of the economy  including the energy industry 
as a result of these factors  capital markets have become more restrictive 
the commercial paper market  for example  has become more limited for many companies in terms of the amounts of available capital and the corresponding maturities 
medium and long term debt markets have become sensitive to increased credit ratings volatility and to a heightened perception of liquidity risk in the energy sector 
as a result  investors have become more selective and have differentiated among otherwise comparable issuers in a way that has made the financing process more challenging 
in response to these changing market conditions  alliant energy is working closely with its financial advisors and others to access the capital it needs to operate its businesses 
based on its strong cash flows coupled with actions alliant energy expects to take to strengthen its balance sheet  alliant energy currently believes it will be able to secure the capital it requires to implement its refined strategic plan 
alliant energy believes its ability to secure additional capital will be significantly enhanced by the completion of the actions addressed in strategic actions  including the divestiture of selected businesses 
alliant energy s capital requirements are primarily attributable to its utility subsidiaries construction and acquisition programs  resources acquisition and investment opportunities and its debt maturities 
alliant energy s utility subsidiaries anticipate financing their construction expenditures  including new electric generation facilities  during through internally generated funds supplemented  when necessary  by outside financing 
funding for resources acquisition and investment expenditures over that same period of time is expected to be accomplished with a combination of external financings  sales of assets and internally generated funds 
in  alliant energy and resources received sec approval for their ongoing program of external financing  credit support arrangements and other related proposals for the period through dec 
 among other things  the approval authorized alliant energy directly or through financing subsidiaries to issue common and preferred stock  unsecured long term debt securities and other equity linked securities up to an amount of billion  to provide guarantees and credit support for obligations of its subsidiaries up to an amount of billion  to enter into hedging transactions to manage interest rate costs and risk exposure  and to increase its aggregate investment limit in ewgs and fucos to of consolidated retained earnings 
the approval  among other things  also authorized resources to provide guarantees and credit support for obligations of non utility subsidiaries up to an amount of million outstanding at any one time and to spend up to million to construct or acquire energy assets that are incidental to the energy marketing and oil and gas productions of its subsidiaries 
alliant energy s ability to undertake any such financings contemplated by the sec s order is dependent on its ability to access the capital markets as described above 
cash flows selected information from alliant energy s  ip l s and wp l s consolidated statements of cash flows was as follows in thousands alliant energy ip l wp l cash flows from used for operating activities          financing activities         investing activities          in  alliant energy s cash flows from operating activities increased primarily due to changes in working capital  cash flows from financing activities decreased primarily due to proceeds from the issuance of common stock in  partially offset by a net increase in the amount of preferred stock outstanding at ip l  and cash flows used for investing activities decreased primarily due to lower construction and acquisition expenditures partially offset by proceeds received in from the transfer of wp l s transmission assets to atc

common equity in november  alliant energy announced its intentions to raise approximately million to million of common equity in  dependent on market conditions 
the proceeds are expected to be used to fund the power iowa initiative and other regulated domestic utility needs 
the pscw has indicated it will require an additional equity infusion by alliant energy into wp l during alliant energy anticipates the final pscw order  which is expected to be issued in the second quarter of  will also include a customer refund provision if the timing and or amount of the equity infusion differs from the assumptions included in the wp l rate case 
preferred stock in september  ip l redeemed all of its then outstanding shares of preferred stock at an aggregate redemption price of million 
in december  ip l issued six million shares of preferred stock at per share in a private placement 
ip l used the net proceeds of approximately million to repay its short term debt and for general corporate purposes  including to fund capital expenditures and to repay other debt 
debt in june  alliant energy received approval through dec 
 from the sec to issue and sell up to an aggregate amount of billion of short term debt outstanding at any one time and to guarantee borrowings by resources in an aggregate amount that would not exceed million at any one time in addition to its other guarantee authority 
in addition  ip l received sec approval to issue short term debt in a principal amount which would not at any one time exceed million 
alliant energy discontinued the use of its utility money pool in and wp l and ip l are now meeting any short term borrowing needs by issuing commercial paper and borrowing on bank lines of credit  respectively 
alliant energy and its subsidiaries are party to various credit facilities and other borrowing arrangements  some of which are summarized below 
in addition to the specific covenants detailed below under the day revolving credit agreements  alliant energy s facilities and borrowing arrangements contain various customary terms and conditions  including required capitalization  net worth and interest coverage requirements  maintenance requirements related to bonded property and cross default provisions 
at dec 
  alliant energy and its subsidiaries were in compliance with the financial ratios and covenant requirements under their respective credit facilities and borrowing arrangements 
the aggregate borrowing capacity under short term credit agreements of alliant energy and its subsidiaries at dec 
 was million 
at dec 
  the total amount borrowed under these facilities was million leaving unused capacity of million 
in addition  resources had a million standby credit facility at dec 
 as discussed below 
there are no borrowings currently outstanding under such facility 
alliant energy also had million of short term borrowings outstanding at dec 
 related to various generation projects in china 
in october  alliant energy completed the syndication of three day revolving credit facilities totaling million  available for direct borrowing or to support commercial paper  which replaced the former facilities that totaled million in borrowing availability 
the three facilities consist of a million facility for alliant energy at the parent company level  which was reduced to million at the end of  a million facility for ip l and a million facility for wp l 
availability under the alliant energy credit facility will be further reduced by the proceeds of asset sales in excess of of alliant energy s consolidated assets in any month period commencing october and up to million from the proceeds of an issuance of equity securities in excess of million 
these new credit facility agreements contain various covenants  including the following covenant description covenant requirement status at dec 
 alliant energy consolidated debt to capital ratio less than consolidated net worth at least billion billion ebitda interest coverage ratio at least x x ip l debt to capital ratio less than wp l debt to capital ratio less than in compliance with the agreements  results of discontinued operations have been included in the covenant calculations 
the debt component of the capital ratios includes long and short term debt excluding trade payables  capital lease obligations  letters of credit and guarantees of the foregoing and unfunded vested benefits under pension plans 
the equity component excludes accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
alliant energy is also subject to a puhca requirement whereby alliant energy s common equity balance must be at least of its total consolidated capitalization  including short term debt 
alliant energy s common equity ratio as of dec 
  as computed under such requirement  was 
in december  resources secured a day million standby credit facility 
designed as a bridge to enhance alliant energy s short term liquidity position until it receives the expected proceeds from the assets it plans to sell in  the availability under the facility is reduced by amounts realized on such asset sales 
at dec 
  there were no borrowings outstanding under this credit facility 
also in december  whiting finalized a secured revolving million credit facility which will mature in december at dec 
  whiting had million of borrowings outstanding under this facility at an interest rate of  which was included in long term debt on alliant energy s consolidated balance sheet 
information regarding commercial paper and bank facility borrowings at dec 
 was as follows dollars in millions alliant energy parent wp l commercial paper outstanding weighted average maturity of commercial paper days days discount rates on commercial paper bank facility borrowings interest rates on bank facility borrowings as a result of the moody s downgrade of alliant energy s commercial paper in january to p  alliant energy s ability to issue commercial paper at the parent company level has been reduced  requiring greater reliance on bank lines 
in addition to funding working capital needs  the availability of short term financing provides the companies flexibility in the issuance of long term securities 
the level of short term borrowing fluctuates based on seasonal corporate needs  the timing of long term financing and capital market conditions 
at dec 
  ip l and wp l were authorized by the applicable federal or state regulatory agencies to issue short term debt of million and million  respectively 
the million borrowing authority for wp l includes million for general corporate purposes  an additional million should wp l no longer sell its utility receivables and an additional million should wp l need to repurchase its variable rate demand bonds 
in december  resources issued million of senior notes due in a private placement 
the notes are unconditionally guaranteed by alliant energy 
resources used the proceeds to repay short term debt 
at dec 
  alliant energy  ip l and wp l had million  million and million  respectively  of long term debt that will mature prior to dec 
 the million at alliant energy represents long term debt maturities of million in  million in  million in  million in and million in depending upon market conditions  it is currently anticipated that a majority of the maturing debt will be refinanced with the issuance of long term securities

refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on short and long term debt 
credit ratings and balance sheet access to the long and short term capital and credit markets  and costs of external financing  are dependent on creditworthiness 
alliant energy is committed to taking the necessary steps required to maintain strong credit ratings and to strengthen its balance sheet 
refer to strategic actions for a discussion of specific actions being taken in this regard 
although alliant energy believes such actions will enable it to strengthen its balance sheet and maintain strong credit ratings  no assurance can be given that it will be able to maintain its existing credit ratings 
if alliant energy s credit ratings are downgraded in the future  then alliant energy s borrowing costs may increase and its access to capital markets may be limited 
if access to capital markets becomes significantly constrained  then alliant energy s results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
in december and january  standard poor s and moody s  respectively  issued revised credit ratings as follows long term debt ratings only apply to senior debt standard poor s moody s ip l secured long term debt a a unsecured long term debt bbb baa commercial paper a p corporate bbb baa wp l secured long term debt a a unsecured long term debt bbb a commercial paper a p corporate a a resources a unsecured long term debt bbb baa commercial paper a p corporate bbb baa alliant energy unsecured long term debt bbb not rated commercial paper a p corporate bbb not rated all entities outlook negative stable a resources debt is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by alliant energy 
ratings triggers the long term debt of alliant energy and its subsidiaries is not subject to any repayment requirements as a result of credit rating downgrades or so called ratings triggers 
however  certain lease agreements do contain such ratings triggers 
the threshold for these triggers varies among the applicable leases 
if the payments were accelerated under all the affected leases it would result in accelerated payments of approximately million 
in addition  the amount of proceeds available to ip l and wp l from their sale of utility customer accounts receivable programs could be reduced in the aggregate by approximately million in the event of certain credit rating downgrades at the alliant energy parent company level 
alliant energy and its subsidiaries are also parties to various agreements  including purchased power agreements  fuel contracts and corporate guarantees that may be deemed to be in default in the event of certain credit rating downgrades 
in the event of such a default  alliant energy or its subsidiaries may be able to cure the default in a number of ways  including posting letters of credit equal to the amount of the exposure  unwinding the contract or paying the obligation 
sale of accounts receivable refer to note of alliant energy s notes to consolidated financial statements for information on alliant energy s sale of accounts receivable program 
off balance sheet arrangements alliant energy utilizes synthetic leases to finance its corporate headquarters  corporate aircraft  certain utility railcars and a utility radio dispatch system 
synthetic leases provide favorable financing rates to alliant energy while allowing it to maintain operating control of its leased assets 
several of alliant energy s synthetic leases involve the use of unconsolidated structured finance or variable interest entities 
alliant energy has guarantees outstanding related to the residual value of these synthetic leases 
alliant energy does not currently anticipate entering into any additional synthetic leases 
alliant energy also uses variable interest entities for its utility sale of accounts receivable program whereby ip l and wp l use proceeds from the sale of the accounts receivable and unbilled revenues to maintain flexibility in their capital structures  take advantage of favorable short term interest rates and finance a portion of their long term cash needs 
the sale of accounts receivables generates a significant amount of short term financing for ip l and wp l 
if this financing alternative were not available  ip l and wp l anticipate they would have enough short term borrowing capacity to compensate 
refer to ratings triggers for the impact of credit rating downgrades on alliant energy and its subsidiaries related to these synthetic leases and accounts receivable sales program 
beginning in the third quarter of  under fin it is reasonably possible that alliant energy could be considered the primary beneficiary of certain variable interest entities utilized for its synthetic lease financings and receivable sales program and could be required to consolidate the operating results and associated assets and liabilities of the variable interest entities in its financial statements 
alliant energy is in the process of evaluating the potential impacts of fin alliant energy is also currently evaluating the structure of its synthetic leases and receivable sales program to determine if these structures can be modified to qualify for off balance sheet treatment under fin contractual obligations alliant energy s long term contractual cash obligations as of dec 
 were as follows in millions thereafter total long term debt note and capital lease obligations note   operating leases note purchase obligations note b ip l s long term contractual cash obligations as of dec 
 were as follows in millions thereafter total long term debt note and capital lease obligations note operating leases note purchase obligations note b wp l s long term contractual cash obligations as of dec 
 were as follows in millions thereafter total long term debt note operating leases note purchase obligations note b at dec 
  long term debt and capital lease obligations as noted in the previous tables were included on the respective consolidated balance sheets 
in addition  at dec 
  there were various other long term liabilities and deferred credits included on the respective consolidated balance sheets that  due to the nature of the liabilities  the timing of payments cannot be estimated and are therefore excluded from the tables 
operating leases and purchase obligations are amounts committed under contract which were not recorded on the respective consolidated balance sheets at dec 
  in accordance with gaap 
purchase obligations represent normal business contracts used to ensure adequate purchased power  coal and natural gas supplies and to minimize exposure to market price fluctuations 
in connection with alliant energy s  ip l s and wp l s construction and acquisition programs  they also enter into commitments related to such programs on an ongoing basis 
sales of non strategic assets in the third quarter of  alliant energy completed the sale of its ownership interest in its cargill alliant electricity trading joint venture to cargill 
the sale proceeds were approximately million  the book value of alliant energy s share of the joint venture 
as noted earlier  the strategic actions currently being executed by alliant energy will focus on additional potential sales of non strategic assets  among other items 
refer to strategic actions  other matters other future considerations and note of alliant energy s notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on the potential impact of future asset sales 
credit risk credit risk is inherent in alliant energy s operations and relates to the risk of loss resulting from non performance of contractual obligations by a counterparty 
alliant energy maintains credit risk oversight and sets limits and policies with regards to its counterparties  which management believes minimizes its overall credit risk exposure 
however  there is no assurance that such policies will protect alliant energy against all losses from non performance by counterparties 
environmental alliant energy s pollution abatement programs are subject to continuing review and are periodically revised due to changes in environmental regulations  construction plans and escalation of construction costs 
while management cannot precisely forecast the effect of future environmental regulations on operations  it has taken steps to anticipate the future while also meeting the requirements of current environmental regulations 
alliant energy s facilities are subject to state and federal requirements of the caa  including meeting ambient air quality standards 
as a result of a new rate of progress rule developed by the wisconsin dnr  and based on existing technology  alliant energy estimates the total aggregate capital investments necessary by wp l to comply with the new rules will be approximately million in through alliant energy is also currently addressing various other potential federal and state environmental rulemakings and activities  including proposed revisions to the wisconsin administrative code concerning the amount of heat that wp l s generating stations can discharge into wisconsin waters which could have a significant impact on wp l s operation of its wisconsin generating facilities  potential new rules that may be pursued by the epa and the states in the alliant energy service territory related to various air emissions  the multiple requests wp l has received from the epa related to the historical operation of wp l s major coal fired generating units  which requests have been the precursor to penalties and additional capital requirements in some cases involving similar requests to other electric generating facilities  the new source review reforms published by the epa in december  several other legislative and regulatory proposals regarding the control of emissions of air pollutants and greenhouse gases from a variety of sources  including generating facilities  and the july request from the wisconsin dnr that wp l submit a written plan for facility closure of the rock river generating station landfill and clean up of its support ponds and all areas where coal combustion waste is present 
alliant energy cannot presently predict the final outcome of these proposals or actions  but believes that required capital investments and or modifications resulting from them could be significant 
alliant energy believes that prudent expenses incurred by ip l and wp l likely would be recovered in rates from its customers 
refer to note e of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of environmental matters 
construction and acquisition expenditures capital expenditures  investments and financing plans are continually reviewed  approved and updated as part of alliant energy s ongoing strategic planning and annual budgeting processes 
in addition  material capital expenditures and investments are subject to a rigorous cross functional review prior to approval 
changes in alliant energy s anticipated construction and acquisition expenditures may result from a number of reasons including economic conditions  regulatory requirements  ability to obtain adequate and timely rate relief  the level of alliant energy s profitability  alliant energy s desire to maintain strong credit ratings and reasonable capitalization ratios  variations in sales  changing market conditions and new opportunities 
as noted in strategic actions  alliant energy recently reduced its anticipated construction and acquisition expenditure levels in order to strengthen its balance sheet 
alliant energy believes its capital control processes adequately reduce the risks associated with large capital expenditures and investments 
alliant energy currently anticipates construction and acquisition expenditures as follows in millions domestic utility ip l utility infrastructure and reliability investments ip l power iowa program wp l utility infrastructure and reliability investments non regulated domestic generation other non regulated business development total from continuing operations  discontinued operations total  excludes approximately million in for potential purchase of turbines and related equipment from affiliates 
alliant energy has not entered into contractual commitments relating to the majority of its anticipated capital expenditures 
as a result  alliant energy does have discretion as to the eventual level of capital expenditures incurred and it closely monitors and updates such estimates on an ongoing basis based on numerous economic and other factors 
in september  the iub approved a settlement agreement establishing advance rate making principles for the proposed mw natural gas fired plant ip l plans to construct in mason city  iowa as part of its power iowa initiative to develop new electric generation capacity in iowa 
the settlement establishes  among other things  a set depreciation period whereby ip l is ensured of recovering the estimated million cost of its investment over years based on a fixed return on the common equity component 
in january  the iub approved ip l s siting certificate for the mason city plant and construction began 
the plant is scheduled to be in service prior to the summer peak demand 
given the status of the current non regulated generation market  alliant energy s initial investments in this market will focus on facilities with underlying long term purchased power agreements 
while alliant energy believes there are excellent acquisition opportunities in the existing non regulated generation market  it will continue to be patient  prudent and diligent in its pursuit of such opportunities 
consistent with this approach  in february  resources announced the purchase of a mw  non regulated  natural gas fired power plant in wisconsin for million  which resources financed with a million year secured credit facility  which is non recourse to alliant energy 
at feb 
  resources had million of borrowings outstanding under this facility  at an interest rate of approximately  and an million letter of credit related to a purchased power agreement 
the entire power output of the facility is sold under contract to milwaukee based we energies through june other matters market risk sensitive instruments and positions alliant energy s primary market risk exposures are associated with interest rates  commodity prices  equity prices and currency exchange rates 
alliant energy has risk management policies to monitor and assist in controlling these market risks and uses derivative instruments to manage some of the exposures 
interest rate risk alliant energy is exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates as a result of its issuance of variable rate debt  utility customer accounts receivable sale program and variable rate leasing agreements 
alliant energy manages its interest rate risk by limiting its variable interest rate exposure and by continuously monitoring the effects of market changes on interest rates 
alliant energy also uses interest rate swap and interest rate forward agreements to assist in the management of its interest exposure 
in the event of significant interest rate fluctuations  management would take actions to minimize the effect of such changes on alliant energy s results of operations and financial condition 
assuming no change in alliant energy s  ip l s and wp l s consolidated financial structure  if variable interest rates were to average basis points higher lower in than in  interest expense and pre tax earnings would increase decrease by approximately million  million and million  respectively 
these amounts were determined by considering the impact of a hypothetical basis point increase decrease in interest rates on alliant energy s  ip l s and wp l s consolidated variable rate debt held  the amount outstanding under the utility customer accounts receivable sale program and variable rate lease balances at dec 
 commodity risk non trading alliant energy is exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the commodity price and transportation costs of electricity and natural gas products it markets 
alliant energy employs established policies and procedures to manage its risks associated with these market fluctuations including the use of various commodity derivatives 
alliant energy s exposure to commodity price risks in its utility business is significantly mitigated by the current rate making structures in place for the recovery of its electric fuel and purchased energy costs as well as its cost of natural gas purchased for resale 
refer to note j of alliant energy s notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
wp l periodically utilizes gas commodity derivative instruments to reduce the impact of price fluctuations on gas purchased and injected into storage during the summer months and withdrawn and sold at current market prices during the winter months 
the gas commodity swaps in place approximate the forecasted storage withdrawal plan during this period 
therefore  market price fluctuations that result in an increase or decrease in the value of the physical commodity are substantially offset by changes in the value of the gas commodity swaps 
to the extent actual storage withdrawals vary from forecasted withdrawals  wp l has physical commodity price exposure 
a increase decrease in the price of gas would not have a significant impact on the combined fair market value of the gas in storage and related swap arrangements in place at dec 
 ip l also utilizes natural gas commodity derivative instruments to mitigate the risk of rising prices 
since the iub allows for the prudently incurred costs associated with these instruments and the underlying supply of natural gas to be recovered from ratepayers  ip l does not have significant natural gas commodity risk exposure 
whiting  currently accounted for as a discontinued operation  is exposed to market risk in the pricing of its oil and gas production 
historically  prices received for oil and gas production have been volatile because of seasonal weather patterns  supply and demand factors  transportation availability and price  and general economic conditions 
worldwide political developments have historically also had an impact on oil prices 
whiting periodically utilizes oil and gas swaps  costless collars and long term delivery contracts to mitigate the impact of oil and gas price fluctuations 
historically  alliant energy has hedged or contracted approximately of its oil and gas volumes 
the actual level of hedging or contracting utilized is based on management s assessment of the prudency of hedging given current market conditions and other factors and is reviewed on an ongoing basis 
based on whiting s estimated oil and gas sales in  and the hedging and delivery contracts outstanding for such period  a sustained increase decrease in oil and gas prices would impact alliant energy s pre tax earnings by approximately million 
southern hydro  currently accounted for as a discontinued operation  owns and operates hydroelectric generation facilities in the state of victoria in australia 
these generation facilities operate as peaking units 
under the rules of the australian market  southern hydro must sell all of its production into a spot market in which the price changes every five minutes and is set on the average of each half hour 
electricity prices in this market can and have been very volatile 
in order to manage the electricity commodity price risk associated with anticipated sales into the spot market  southern hydro enters into a variety of electricity derivative contracts with terms of up to five years 
the value of these derivative instruments can change significantly as a result of changes in forward electricity prices 
these instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas accordingly  per gaap  changes in the fair value of these derivatives  which are non cash valuation adjustments  must be reported in southern hydro s earnings 
alliant energy believes southern hydro s ownership of the physical generating facilities that are not marked to market  combined with the electricity derivative contracts  act as an economic hedge to volatile electricity prices  such that southern hydro s net economic exposure to volatile electricity prices over the next five years is managed within reasonable limits 
southern hydro manages market risks inherent in its business through established derivative trading and risk management policies and tools 
the principal tool utilized in managing the risks associated with volatile prices is a five to day earnings at risk ear model which calculates ear to a confidence level 
at december   the estimated ear for southern hydro for expected earnings in was approximately million 
equity price risk ip l and wp l maintain trust funds to fund their anticipated nuclear decommissioning costs 
at dec 
 and  these funds were invested primarily in domestic equity and debt instruments 
fluctuations in equity prices or interest rates will not affect alliant energy s consolidated results of operations as such fluctuations are recorded in equally offsetting amounts of investment income and depreciation wp l or interest ip l expense when they are realized 
in  wp l entered into a four year hedge on equity assets in its nuclear decommissioning trust fund 
refer to note c of alliant energy s notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
currency risk alliant energy has investments in various countries where the net investments are not hedged  including australia  brazil  china and new zealand 
as a result  these investments are subject to currency exchange risk with fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
at dec 
  alliant energy had a cumulative foreign currency translation loss  net of any tax benefits realized  of million  which related to decreases in value of the brazil real of million  new zealand dollar of million and australian dollar of million in relation to the us dollar 
this loss is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss on alliant energy s consolidated balance sheets 
based on alliant energy s investments at dec 
  a sustained increase decrease over the next months in the foreign exchange rates of australia  brazil  china and new zealand would result in a corresponding increase decrease in the cumulative foreign currency translation loss of million 
alliant energy s equity income loss from its foreign investments is also impacted by fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
in addition  alliant energy has currency exchange risk associated with the debt issued to finance a thermal plant constructed by alliant energy and its brazilian partners 
in  alliant energy recorded pre tax charges of million related to its share of the foreign currency transaction losses on such debt 
based on the loan balance and currency rates at dec 
  a change in the currency rates would result in a million after tax increase decrease in net income 
refer to notes n and of alliant energy s notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of alliant energy s derivative financial instruments 
accounting pronouncements on oct 
  the eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue alliant energy s natural gas trading business  ng energy trading  llc ng energy  is impacted by eitf issue  which requires that all sales of energy and the related cost of energy purchased under contracts that meet the definition of energy trading contracts under eitf issue and that are derivatives under sfas must be reflected on a net basis in the income statement for all periods presented 
under the guidance of eitf issue  alliant energy reported its energy trading contracts and related gas in storage at fair market value  and reported related revenues and expenses on a gross basis in the income statement 
eitf issue also rescinded eitf issue on a prospective basis 
accordingly  any new contracts entered into after oct 
 must be reported on a historical cost basis rather than at fair market value unless the contract meets the definition of a derivative under sfas alliant energy adopted eitf issue on jan 
 for all contracts that were in place and storage gas acquired prior to oct 
  and will reclassify prior period trading contracts on a net basis in the income statement for the impact of transitioning from reporting inventory and existing contracts that are not derivatives under sfas at fair value to historical cost will be reported in net income in the first quarter of and is not expected to be material due to the relatively small size of the ng energy business 
had alliant energy presented its trading activities in the income statement on a net basis rather than a gross basis  for  and  non regulated and other revenues and other operation and maintenance expenses would have both decreased million  million and million  respectively  with no impact on net income 
in november  the fasb issued fin which requires disclosures by a guarantor about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
fin also requires recognizing  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the recognition and measurement provisions of fin are effective on a prospective basis for guarantees issued or modified after dec 
 the disclosure requirements of fin are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after dec 
 alliant energy does not anticipate fin will have a material impact on its financial condition or results of operations 
refer to note d of alliant energy s notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on guarantees 
in january  the fasb issued fin which addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities 
fin requires consolidation where there is a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity or where the variable interest entity does not have sufficient equity at risk to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
alliant energy will apply the provisions of fin prospectively for all variable interest entities created after jan 
 for variable interest entities created before jan 
  alliant energy will be required to consolidate all entities in which it is a primary beneficiary beginning in the third quarter of it is reasonably possible the implementation of fin will require that certain variable interest entities be included on alliant energy s consolidated balance sheets 
refer to notes and of alliant energy s notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on variable interest entities related to synthetic leases and the utility customer accounts receivable sale program  respectively 
sfas  which provides accounting and disclosure requirements for retirement obligations associated with long lived assets  was effective jan 
 sfas requires that the present value of retirement costs for which alliant energy has a legal obligation be recorded as liabilities with an equivalent amount added to the asset cost 
the liability is accreted to its present value each period and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
upon settlement of the liability  an entity settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss 
the adoption of sfas will have no impact on ip l s and wp l s earnings  as the effects will be offset by the establishment of regulatory assets or liabilities pursuant to sfas  accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
alliant energy has completed a detailed assessment of the specific applicability and implications of sfas the scope of sfas as it relates to alliant energy primarily includes decommissioning costs for daec and kewaunee 
it also applies to a smaller extent to several other regulated and non regulated assets including  but not limited to  active ash landfills  water intake facilities  underground storage tanks  groundwater wells  transmission and distribution equipment  easements  leases and the dismantlement of certain hydro facilities 
other than daec and kewaunee  alliant energy s asset retirement obligations as of jan 
 are not significant 
prior to january  ip l and wp l recorded nuclear decommissioning charges in accumulated depreciation on their consolidated balance sheets 
upon adoption of sfas  ip l and wp l will reverse approximately million and million  respectively  previously recorded in accumulated depreciation and will record liabilities of approximately million and million  respectively 
the difference between amounts previously recorded and the net sfas liability will be deferred as a regulatory asset and is expected to approximate million and for ip l and wp l  respectively 
ip l and wp l have previously recognized removal costs as a component of depreciation expense and accumulated depreciation for other non nuclear assets in accordance with regulatory rate recovery 
as of dec 
  ip l and wp l estimate that they have approximately million and million  respectively  of such regulatory liabilities recorded in accumulated depreciation on their consolidated balance sheets 
in  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets which replaced sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas also applies to discontinued operations 
sfas requires that those long lived assets classified as held for sale be measured at the lower of their carrying amount or the fair value less cost to sell  and that no depreciation  depletion and amortization shall be recorded while an asset is classified as held for sale 
discontinued operations are no longer measured at net realizable value or include amounts for operating losses that have not yet occurred 
sfas also broadens the reporting of discontinued operations to include all components of an entity with operations that can be distinguished from the rest of the entity and that will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity in a planned disposal transaction that is probable of being completed within one year 
if the criteria to classify operations as held for sale are subsequently no longer met  the assets classified as held for sale shall be reclassified as held and used in the period the held for sale criteria are no longer met 
alliant energy adopted sfas on january  refer to note of alliant energy s notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information about alliant energy s application of sfas in the fourth quarter of as relates to various assets it is planning to sell 
alliant energy does not expect the various other new accounting pronouncements not mentioned above that were effective in to have a material impact on alliant energy s results of operations or financial condition 
critical accounting policies based on historical experience and various other factors  alliant energy believes the policies identified below are critical to its business and the understanding of its results of operations as they require critical estimates be made based on the assumptions and judgment of management 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make various estimates and assumptions that affect revenues  expenses  assets  liabilities and the disclosure of contingencies 
the results of these estimates and judgments form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates and judgments 
alliant energy s management has discussed these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of its board of directors 
refer to note of alliant energy s notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of alliant energy s accounting policies and the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
regulatory assets and liabilities alliant energy s domestic utility business is regulated by various federal and state regulatory agencies 
as a result  the regulated utilities qualify for the application of sfas sfas recognizes that the actions of a regulator can provide reasonable assurance of the existence of an asset or liability 
regulatory assets or liabilities arise as a result of a difference between gaap and the accounting principles imposed by the regulatory agencies 
regulatory assets generally represent incurred costs that have been deferred as they are probable of recovery in customer rates 
regulatory liabilities generally represent obligations to make refunds to customers for various reasons 
alliant energy s utility subsidiaries recognize regulatory assets and liabilities in accordance with the rulings of their federal and state regulators and future regulatory rulings may impact the carrying value and accounting treatment of alliant energy s regulatory assets and liabilities 
alliant energy periodically assesses whether the regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as regulatory environment changes  recent rate orders issued by the applicable regulatory agencies and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation 
the assumptions and judgments used by regulatory authorities continue to have an impact on the recovery of costs  the rate of return on invested capital and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered by rates 
a change in these assumptions may result in a material impact on alliant energy s results of operations 
refer to note c of alliant energy s notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
asset valuations long lived assets alliant energy s consolidated balance sheets include significant long lived assets  which are not subject to recovery under sfas as a result  alliant energy must generate future cash flows from such assets in a non regulated environment to ensure the carrying value is not impaired 
many of these assets are the result of capital investments which have been made in recent years and have not yet reached a mature life cycle 
alliant energy assesses the carrying amount and potential impairment of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors alliant energy considers in determining if an impairment review is necessary include a significant underperformance of the assets relative to historical or projected future operating results  a significant change in alliant energy s use of the acquired assets or business strategy related to such assets  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when alliant energy determines an impairment review is necessary  a comparison is made between the expected undiscounted future cash flows and the carrying amount of the asset 
if the carrying amount of the asset is the larger of the two balances  an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
the fair value is determined by the use of quoted market prices  appraisals  or the use of valuation techniques such as expected discounted future cash flows 
alliant energy must make assumptions regarding these estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
alliant energy has made payments of million for turbines and related generation equipment at dec 
 and has also entered into commitments for an additional million 
alliant energy expects to utilize approximately million of such equipment in its first power iowa generation project and is currently reviewing various other potential generation projects to utilize the remaining million of equipment 
as a result  alliant energy has assessed the recoverability of the million equipment cost compared to the future anticipated cash flows from the generation projects under review 
the future anticipated cash flows is a significant estimate 
alliant energy has no current intentions to sell any of this equipment 
if a decision was made to sell such equipment  the recoverability of the equipment cost would be assessed by comparing the future anticipated sales proceeds to the carrying value of the equipment 
investments alliant energy s consolidated balance sheets include investments in several available for sale securities accounted for in accordance with sfas alliant energy monitors any unrealized losses from such investments to determine if the loss is considered to be a temporary or permanent decline 
the determination as to whether the investment is temporarily versus permanently impaired requires considerable judgment 
when the investment is considered permanently impaired  the previously recorded unrealized loss would be recorded directly to the income statement as a realized loss 
alliant energy incurred pre tax valuation charges under the provisions of sfas of million and million related to its mcleod and energy technologies investments  respectively  in alliant energy s consolidated balance sheets also contain various other investments that are evaluated for recoverability when indicators of impairment may exist 
resources holds a non controlling interest in five brazilian electric utility companies accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
the recoverability of these equity method investments is assessed by comparing the future anticipated local currency cash flows from these investments and the carrying value of these investments 
the future anticipated cash flows currently include anticipated periodic distributions that  when aggregated  exceed the carrying value of these investments 
the future anticipated cash flows represents a significant estimate 
the million carrying value of alliant energy s brazil investments has been reduced by million of pre tax cumulative foreign currency translation losses 
the net of tax balance of million has been recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss on alliant energy s consolidated balance sheet at dec 
 cumulative foreign currency translation losses are reflected in alliant energy s results of operations only if the related investment is sold or substantially liquidated 
if alliant energy would decide to exit these brazil investments in the future  the recoverability of these equity method investments would be assessed by comparing the future anticipated sales proceeds to the carrying value 
alliant energy has no current intention of exiting these brazil investments 
resources investment in mexico consists of a loan receivable including accrued interest income from a mexican development company 
the loan accrues interest at and is secured by the undeveloped land of the resort community 
repayment of the loan principal and interest will be based on a portion of the proceeds from the sales of real estate in the resort community and therefore is dependent on the successful development of the project and the ability to sell real estate 
the recoverability of this loan receivable is currently assessed by comparing the fair value of the undeveloped land of the resort community used to secure the loan and the carrying value of the loan including accrued interest income 
based on an independent appraisal that indicated the fair value of the collateral was less than the loan balance plus accrued interest  alliant energy recorded a valuation allowance of approximately million in the second quarter of and ceased accruing interest income on the loan 
based on an updated independent appraisal  alliant energy reversed the valuation allowance in the fourth quarter of and resumed accruing interest income on the loan 
the fair value of such collateral is a significant estimate 
refer to note of alliant energy s notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning alliant energy s investments in brazil and mexico 
alliant energy announced its intentions to sell various businesses in november and is currently accounting for them as assets held for sale and discontinued operations 
the estimated sales proceeds  less costs to sell  for each business exceeded the carrying value of each business as of dec 
 alliant energy will continue to monitor the estimated sales proceeds of its assets held for sale as they relate to the respective carrying values 
refer to note of alliant energy s notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
goodwill as a result of the adoption of sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  on jan 
  alliant energy is required to evaluate its goodwill for impairment at least annually and more frequently when indicators of impairment may exist 
at dec 
  alliant energy had million of net goodwill including million  million and million within its cogenex  china and smartenergy reporting units  respectively on its consolidated balance sheet 
if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value  including goodwill  a goodwill impairment charge may be necessary 
alliant energy estimates the fair value of its reporting units utilizing a combination of market value indicators and the expected discounted future cash flows 
this process requires the use of significant management estimates and judgments regarding cash flow assumptions from future sales  operating costs and discount rates over an indefinite life 
alliant energy s cash flow assumptions are derived using a combination of historical trends  internal budgets  strategic plans and other market information 
each reporting unit is evaluated separately based on the nature of its operations and therefore the assumptions vary by reporting unit relative to its applicable circumstances 
to determine its discount rates  alliant energy utilizes the capital asset pricing model which is based upon market comparables adjusted for company specific risk 
in the event market comparables are not available  alliant energy utilizes expected industry returns based upon published information 
in the fourth quarter of  alliant energy recorded a pre tax goodwill impairment charge related to smartenergy of million 
derivative financial instruments alliant energy uses derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to fluctuations in interest rates  certain commodity prices  volatility in a portion of natural gas sales volumes due to weather and to mitigate the equity price volatility associated with certain investments in equity securities 
alliant energy does not use such instruments for speculative purposes 
to account for these derivative instruments in accordance with the applicable accounting rules  alliant energy must determine the fair value of its derivatives 
in accordance with sfas  the fair value of all derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet with the changes in their value recognized in earnings for the non regulated businesses  unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
for ip l and wp l  changes in the derivatives fair values are generally recorded as regulatory assets or liabilities 
if an established  quoted market exists for the underlying commodity of the derivative instrument  alliant energy uses the quoted market price to value the derivative instrument 
for other derivatives  alliant energy estimates the value based upon other quoted prices or acceptable valuation methods 
alliant energy also reviews the nature of its contracts for the purchase and sale of non financial assets to assess whether the contracts meet the definition of a derivative and the requirements to follow hedge accounting as allowed by the applicable accounting rules 
the determination of derivative status and valuations involves considerable judgment 
the majority of alliant energy s derivative transactions are in its regulated domestic utility business and based on the fuel and natural gas cost recovery mechanisms in place  as well as other specific regulatory authorizations  changes in fair market values of such derivatives generally have no impact on alliant energy s results of operations 
alliant energy does have an embedded derivative within its exchangeable senior notes that is impacted by the value of mcleod stock 
changes in the fair value of this derivative impact alliant energy s results of operations and the changes did have a material impact on alliant energy s results of operations 
however  given a significant decline in the value of the mcleod stock  alliant energy does not expect changes in the fair value of this derivative to have a material impact on alliant energy s results of operations in the foreseeable future 
in addition  alliant energy has a small investment in a gas trading business 
such business accounted for all of its trading transactions under eitf issue through and adopted the provisions of eitf issue on jan 
 and for new transactions after oct 
 
however  due to the insignificant size of this business  alliant energy does not expect this accounting change to have a material impact on alliant energy s results of operations in the future 
unbilled revenues unbilled revenues are primarily associated with alliant energy s utility operations 
energy sales to individual customers are based on the reading of their meters  which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month 
at the end of each month  amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of the last meter reading are estimated and the corresponding estimated unbilled revenue is recorded 
the unbilled revenue estimate is based on daily generation volumes  estimated customer usage by class  weather impacts  line losses and the most recent customer rates 
such process involves the use of various estimates  thus significant changes in the estimates could have a material impact on alliant energy s results of operations 
accounting for pensions alliant energy accounts for pensions under sfas  employers accounting for pensions 
under these rules  certain assumptions are made which represent significant estimates 
there are many factors involved in determining an entity s pension liabilities and costs each period including assumptions regarding employee demographics including age  life expectancies  compensation levels  discount rates  assumed rate of returns and funding 
changes made to the plan provisions may also impact current and future pension costs 
alliant energy s assumptions are supported by historical data and reasonable projections and are reviewed annually with an outside actuary firm and an investment consulting firm 
as of dec 
  alliant energy was using a discount rate and a annual rate of return on investments 
in selecting an assumed discount rate  alliant energy reviews various corporate aa bond indices 
the annual rate of return is consistent with alliant energy s historical returns and is based on projected long term equity and bond returns  maturities and asset allocations 
a basis point change in the discount rate would result in approximate changes of million and million in alliant energy s qualified pension benefit obligation and pension expense  respectively 
a basis point change in the rate of return would result in an approximate change of million in qualified pension expense 
other future considerations in addition to items discussed earlier in md a  the following items could impact alliant energy s future financial condition or results of operations asset sales it is possible alliant energy could record material gains  losses  accounting adjustments or other charges and or income related to its planned asset divestitures discussed in strategic actions 
alliant energy is not able to predict or estimate what such items may be at this time 
refer to note of alliant energy s notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
alliant energy announced in march that it entered into an agreement with new zealand based meridian energy limited for the sale of alliant energy s australian investment  primarily made up of alliant energy s ownership of southern hydro 
the sale price will be approximately million 
this amount includes the repayment of approximately million in debt in australia 
on an after tax basis  the sale will result in net cash proceeds to alliant energy of approximately million 
the transaction is expected to close by the end of april and is subject to customary closing conditions 
retirement benefits alliant energy s qualified pension and other postretirement benefit expenses for are currently expected to be approximately million higher than in  primarily due to unfavorable asset returns  a reduction in the discount rate used to value plan benefit obligations and expected increases in retiree medical costs 
alliant energy will pursue the possible recovery of the utility portion of these cost increases  which represents a significant majority of the increase  in any rate filings it has in its various jurisdictions exchangeable senior notes at dec 
  the carrying amount of the debt component of resources exchangeable senior notes was million  consisting of the par value of million  less unamortized debt discount of million 
the terms of the exchangeable senior notes require resources to pay interest on the par value of the notes at from february to february  and at thereafter until maturity in february as explained in note a of alliant energy s notes to consolidated financial statements  resources accounted for the net proceeds from the issuance of the notes as two separate components  a debt component and an embedded derivative component 
in accordance with sfas  alliant energy determined the initial carrying value of the debt component by subtracting the fair value of the derivative component from the net proceeds realized from the issuance of the exchangeable senior notes 
this resulted in a very low initial carrying amount of the debt component which results in the recording of interest expense at an effective rate of of the carrying amount of the debt component 
for  interest expense on the notes was million 
interest payments in excess of interest expense are recorded as a reduction of the carrying amount of the debt component 
as a result of the higher interest payments for the first three years  the carrying amount of the debt component declined until it reached million in february  and then gradually increases over the next years to the ultimate repayment amount of million in interest expense on the debt component of the notes will be million in  and if the existing mcleod shares would ever be cancelled  the notes would remain outstanding until maturity 
enterprise resource planning erp system alliant energy implemented a new erp system in october which will result in annual amortization expense of approximately million for five years 
alliant energy is seeking rate recovery of the utility portion of the amortized expenses which represents a significant majority of the amortized expenses
