allocation of allowance for credit losses is based upon estimates of potential credit losses and is maintained at a level considered adequate to provide for losses that can be reasonably anticipated 
the allowance is increased by provisions charged to expense and reduced by net charge offs 
management continually eval uates the economic climate and other conditions to determine the adequacy of the allowance

believes that any breakdown or allocation of the allowance into loan categories lends an appearance of exactness which does not exist  in that the allowance is utilized as a single unallocated reserve available for all loans and commitments to extend credit 
the allowance breakd own shown above should not be interpreted as an indication of the specific amount or specific loan categories in which future charge offs may ultimately occur

by bank policy all loans and leases that are classified substandard risk rating or doubtful risk rating are reviewed to determine if they are impaired 
an impaired loan defined by fasb  is one which based on current information and events  it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
all amounts due according to the contractual terms means that both the contractual interest payments and contractual principal payments will be collected as scheduled in the loan agreement 
when a loan is determined to be impaired  the extent of impairment is based on the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate 
however  as a practical expedient  fasb permits a creditor to measure impairment based on the fair value of the collateral 
it is this later form of measurement that the bank has elected to use  as personal or real property assets collateralize a large percentage of the bank s loans 
in selecting this approach to determining the necessity of specific reserves  the bank documents how the fair value of the collateral was determined  eg current appraisal real property  equipment or inventory  method for valuation of collectable accounts or notes receivable  method for valuation of other assets 
supporting rationale for adjustments to appraisals or loan to value discount applied to determine the collateral value 
the qualifications  expertise and independence of the appraiser 
for purposes of the bank s credit policy regarding this section of the alll methodology the following practices and definitions apply 
an appraisal will be considered current for the initial assessment of a loan under fasb  if it is less than six months old 
in subsequent quarterly assessments the appraisal may not be older than twelve months 
where we are assessing accounts or notes receivable we should order a receivables audit to assist in the initial assessment and refresh it every six months 
in developing the rationale to support appraisal adjustments or the loan to value discount on personal property  external comps and collateral audits should be used as much as possible 
all costs to sell or liquidate the collateral  except legal expenses  are to be included 
an estimate may be used where definitive amounts are not available 
the calculation of the specific reserve follows gross collateral value less cost to sell less loan to value discount equals net collateral value less current principal outstanding if the calculation produces a collateral excess  it is not appropriate to assign a specific reserve 
if the calculation results in a collateral shortfall  the specific reserve should equal the amount of the shortfall 
the loan to value discount does not have to follow the bank standard if the rationale for an adjustment warrants a greater or lesser amount
