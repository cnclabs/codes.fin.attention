profit or loss for each segment is reported on a pretax basis  without an allocation of realized investment gains or interest expense 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to investments  agent receivables  intangible assets  policy liabilities  income taxes  regulatory requirements  contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following accounting policies  judgments and estimates  which have been discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors  critically impact preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
investment in debt and equity securities 
the company holds debt and equity interests in a variety of companies  many of which are seeking to exploit recent technology advancements 
the majority of these are publicly traded and many have experienced volatile market prices 
we periodically evaluate whether the declines in fair value of our investments are other than temporary 
these evaluations involve significant judgment 
our evaluation consists of a review of qualitative and quantitative factors  including analysis of the company s competitive position in its markets  deterioration in the financial condition of the issuer  downgrades of the security by a rating agency  and other publicly available issuer specific news or general market conditions 
declines in fair values of securities deemed to be other than temporary are included in net income as realized investment losses 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the current carrying value of the investments  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
goodwill and intangible impairment 
assessing recoverability of the company s goodwill and other intangibles including deferred policy acquisition costs and value of insurance acquired requires assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors see policy liabilities below to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
on january  the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and performed an evaluation for potential impairment 
the company concluded that no impairment adjustment was necessary for its goodwill or other intangible assets 
policy liabilities and policy intangible assets 
establishing policy liabilities and related intangible assets  including deferred acquisition costs and the value of acquired insurance  for the company s long duration insurance contracts requires making many assumptions  including policyholder persistency  mortality rates  investment yields  discretionary benefit increases  new business pricing  and operating expense levels 
the company evaluates historical experience for these factors when assessing the need for changing current assumptions 
however  since many of these factors are interdependent and subject to short term volatility during the long duration contract period  substantial estimates and judgment are required 
accordingly  if actual experience emerges differently from that assumed  material financial statement adjustments could be required 
deferred taxes 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized 
in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  the company has considered ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies but has not assumed future taxable income 
in the event the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
litigation 
as further described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  united liberty is party to an outstanding lawsuit concerning payment of policyholder dividends 
the company is currently unable to determine whether an unfavorable outcome of this action is likely  and no provision has been recorded for an unfavorable outcome 
accordingly  if an unfavorable outcome occurs  a financial statement adjustment would be required 
acquisitions national affiliated investors life on july   the company acquired  through an assumption reinsurance agreement  of the inforce business of national affiliated investors life insurance company nail for a net cash purchase price of approximately  the nail acquisition 
the acquisition was coordinated through the national organization of life and health guaranty associations 
the acquired business consists primarily of individual life insurance business with policy reserves and annual premium of approximately  and  respectively 
citizens insurance company on october   the company acquired of the stock of citizens insurance formerly kentucky insurance company from an unaffiliated insurance holding company the citizens insurance acquisition 
citizens insurance is licensed as a property and casualty insurance company in six states and has approximately million of statutory capital and surplus  however  it currently has no insurance operations 
the aggregate purchase price for the citizens insurance acquisition was approximately  including net costs associated with the transaction of approximately 
united liberty life insurance company on may   the company and citizens security acquired of the common stock of united liberty from an unaffiliated insurance holding company the united acquisition 
the aggregate purchase price for the united acquisition was approximately  including net costs associated with the acquisition of approximately 
in conjunction with the acquisition  the seller retained approximately  of united liberty s real estate related and other assets  which were replaced with cash by citizens security 
financial position assets 
at december   the company s available for sale fixed maturities had a fair value of  and amortized cost of  the company s fixed maturities portfolio increased approximately during and during  on an amortized cost basis 
these increases are primarily attributable to preneed life sales growth 
shown below is a distribution by rating category of the company s fixed maturities portfolio as of december  standard poor s corporation rating amortized cost fair value investment grade aaa to a   bbb to bbb   total investment grade   non investment grade bb to bb   b to b   ccc to c   ci to not rated   total non investment grade   total fixed maturities   net of write downs on bonds whose decline in value is believed to be other than temporary fair values as of december  were obtained primarily from interactive data corporation 
the company believes it has a well diversified portfolio and has no plans to adjust its non investment grade portfolio significantly  unless necessary to satisfy requirements of state regulators or rating agencies 
the company purchases non investment grade bonds to obtain higher yields or convertible features and attempts to reduce credit risk by portfolio diversification 
non investment grade securities comprised and of the fixed maturities portfolio  on an amortized cost basis at december  and  respectively 
during  the company recognized approximately  of impairment losses on fixed maturities  with the majority of these related to the airline and telecommunication industries 
the company is monitoring its fixed maturity portfolio and  although it has no specific projections  if the overall economy does not improve  additional impairments could occur during shown below are the company s four largest holdings in non investment grade bonds by a single issuer as of december  non investment grade december  amortized cost fair value largest   second largest   third largest   fourth largest   total   the company had no guarantee or other type of enhancement associated with the issuers represented above 
during  the company s investment in equity securities increased  on a cost basis and decreased  on a fair value basis  after decreasing  and  on a cost and fair value basis  respectively  during as of december  and  there were  and  respectively  of unrealized gains on equity securities  compared to  of unrealized losses at december  the company reviews its marketable investments each quarter to determine if there have been declines in their value that in management s opinion are other than temporary 
these reviews can involve qualitative and quantitative information relating to an individual company or industry and general factors impacting the economy 
however  due to wide market fluctuations occurring during the past two years  determining whether declines are temporary has become much more complex and judgmental 
these reviews resulted in the recognition of impairment losses on equity securities totaling  during    and  for the first through fourth quarters  respectively 
in addition   of impairment losses were recognized on fixed maturities during   and  during the second  third  and fourth quarters  respectively 
during  equity securities were sold which contained impairment writedowns of  citizens security owns the building in which the company and its subsidiaries maintain their home offices 
they occupy approximately of the building with the balance leased to third party tenants 
market conditions for this property are generally favorable 
an updated appraisal obtained during indicates the market value of the property is approximately  higher than its carrying value 
at december  the company has recorded  of goodwill and  of other intangible assets for deferred policy acquisition costs and value of insurance acquired 
as noted in the above discussion of critical accounting policies and estimates  these intangibles  and the recorded value of policy liabilities  are based on many assumptions that require substantial estimates and judgment 
in connection with adoption of sfas no 
 the company reassessed the assumptions supporting these values 
although no impairment was considered necessary  a continued historically low interest rate environment could require adjustment of these recorded values 
liabilities 
a comparison of total policy liabilities as of december   and is shown below 
approximately of the total consists of insurance policy benefit reserves while policyholder deposit liabilities represent of the total 
year ended december home service life    broker life    preneed life    dental    other health    total    home service life sales have been favorable in recent years  with net growth in policy liabilities of and in and  respectively  through a combination of attracting new producers and continuing to focus on meeting the needs of existing customers and agents 
the broker life segment s policy liability net increase of  resulted primarily from normal aging of existing reserves 
a significant portion of the  decrease in broker life policy liabilities during relates to expiration of a withdrawal waiting period for the nail business acquired during during and  the company increased preneed life production through arrangements with several third party marketing groups and its internal marketing organization  with significant growth occurring in ohio  pennsylvania  kentucky  indiana  and north carolina 
a significant portion of this growth consists of single premium policies whereby individuals are fully funding their funeral costs 
due to the lower interest rate environment  the company has reduced the rate of annual increases in benefit amounts and is in the process of reducing some agent commission schedules 
accordingly  depending on competitor responses  future business growth could be adversely impacted 
the company s dental products are annual term coverages  accordingly  policy liabilities for this segment are not significant 
the other health segment business is not a significant marketing focus 
shown below is a progression of the company s policyholder deposit activity for the year ended december  year ended december  total annuity and universal other life beginning balance    deposits    withdrawals    interest credited    ending balance    as indicated above  total policyholder deposits decreased by a net  during the company is not devoting significant marketing effort towards annuity  universal life and other deposit products and has elected not to aggressively compete in crediting excess interest on such products 
consolidated results and analysis premiums and other considerations 
the following table details premiums and other considerations received during the past three fiscal years 
year ended december home service life    broker life    preneed life    dental    other health    total    home service life premium increased and during and  respectively 
new sales levels continue to be favorable  at levels which more than exceed normal policy lapses 
the company continues to attract a number of successful  experienced home service agents without subsidizing inexperienced agents 
in addition  the company s program to automate and streamline agent field accounting continues to expand with favorable reaction among the agency force 
during early the company terminated a small home service marketing joint venture in two southern states with a much larger property and casualty insurance carrier 
to mitigate effects of the lower interest rate environment  during the second quarter of the company will be introducing premium rate increases on its home service products 
the decrease in broker life premium during resulted from reduction of business provided by certain larger brokers during and continuing pressure from the overall economic slowdown on middle and lower income consumers 
the company is evaluating opportunities for revising its product design and commission rates to counteract the softening in demand for its simplified issue and graded benefit life policies 
the broker life premium increase during is primarily attributable to receiving a full year of premium on the nail business compared to receiving six months of additional premium during the increase in preneed life premium during and the increase during resulted from intensified marketing efforts aimed at defining the company as a committed participant in this market  successfully negotiating competitive third party marketing agreements  implementing various product enhancements  and positive referrals from customers who comment favorably on the company s organization and customer service 
however  as described above  in early  the company modified certain policy benefits and commissions which may reduce future premium production 
the growth in dental premium during resulted primarily from normal inflationary increases  while the growth during was impacted by loss of a large group case 
during the past two years  new business production has become increasingly competitive as larger providers expand their marketing initiatives 
however  the company has historically maintained strong customer and agent loyalty by continuing to improve customer service  including sales and administrative support functions 
the company has not been actively marketing other health coverages for several years 
however  in response to agent requests  certain cancer and disability protection products have been updated and promoted 
pricing  underwriting  and claims experience on these products are closely monitored 
investments 
the company monitors its available for sale fixed maturities and equity securities to assure they are strategically positioned within the current market environment 
this practice has historically resulted in holding significant equity security positions  which tend to dampen current income yields in favor of an overall total return focus 
the company s equity securities comprised and of its total investment portfolios at december  and  respectively 
the company s investment income yields were   and for   and  respectively 
the yield decline resulted primarily from substantially lower interest rates on new investments and the company s net addition to its fixed maturity portfolio during the year  much of which is attributable to additional preneed life business 
the yield increase resulted primarily from carrying significantly lower levels of equity securities and higher levels of fixed maturity investments 
although the company s total return on investments has historically been very favorable  returns for the past three years have been severely impacted by declines in the telecommunications and technology sectors  a general economic recession and the effect of terrorist events on the securities markets 
as detailed below  net realized and unrealized investment losses totaled approximately  for the three years ended december   while net realized and unrealized gains totaled approximately  for the two years ended december  the company does not anticipate continued severe deterioration in the securities markets  although some additional losses on fixed income securities may occur if the overall economic slowdown continues 
at december   the company s investment portfolios are somewhat more conservatively positioned compared to prior years  and they contain a net unrealized gain outstanding of  below is an approximate calculation of investment income yields and total return rates for the five years ending december  year ended december  investment income      gains and losses fixed maturities realized gains losses      unrealized gains losses      net fixed maturities      equity securities realized gains losses      unrealized gains losses      net equity securities      total gains and losses      total return      average cash and investments      yield income yield total return segment earnings 
the loss before income tax and the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle was  compared to a loss of  in and income of  in pretax profit loss is shown below for the company s five business segments  along with total realized investment gains and interest expense 
year ended december segment profit loss home service life    broker life    preneed life    dental    other health    segment totals    net realized investment gains losses    interest expense    income loss before income tax and cumulative    effect of a change in accounting principle during  the company s investment income yield declined approximately basis points 
accordingly  since the company allocates investment income to each business segment based on average net policy reserves  each of the three life insurance segments were adversely impacted by investment yields during in addition  the home service life profit was adversely impacted by increased mortality  partially offset by lower expenses  while profit benefited from sales growth and improved mortality results 
the broker life earnings decrease resulted primarily from the lower investment yield while the decrease resulted primarily from increased mortality and expenses 
the preneed life loss resulted from lower investment yields  unfavorable mortality  and increased expenses 
during  the company accepted a significant amount of single premium business  which generally has higher than average mortality rates 
in addition  significant management and marketing resources were devoted to this business 
to improve profitability  annual benefit growth rates were reduced twice during  and in early  certain commission rates were reduced and agent contracts revised to encourage production of the more profitable multi pay products 
the preneed life loss improved approximately  from the prior year while premium increased approximately 
this volume growth leveraged fixed costs and improved per policy profitability 
although the company is optimistic about improving profitability in this highly competitive market  if adverse profitability trends continue  several options are available 
these options  including further lowering discretionary annual benefit increases and adjusting premiums and commissions on new business  could further adversely impact the company s ability to compete for new business 
information regarding dental profitability is included below 
the contribution margin shown below is a direct margin without allocable investment income and general expense 
year ended december premium    claims and reserves    contribution margin    claim ratio the overall dental contribution margin increased slightly during due to improved claim levels 
the contribution margin decrease resulted from somewhat higher claims 
also  beginning in the company began encountering more competition as additional insurers are expanding in the dental market and dental providers are continuing to provide higher levels of care to patients 
the company is continuing its ongoing efforts to maintain profitability in this line by reconfiguring products to provide adequate margins for the various dental procedures  utilizing a third party company to provide expert assistance with ongoing adjudication of claims  and continuing its program of aggressive renewal underwriting and re rating 
the company has not devoted significant marketing effort towards its other health products in recent years 
however  during  a significant increase in disability claims occurred  with a concentration in new jersey 
the company has strengthened underwriting practices in this area and has taken steps towards filing for a rate increase on its disability products 
in addition  during the company implemented significant rate increases on certain older blocks of other health business 
income taxes 
historically  the company has experienced a relatively low effective income tax rate  due primarily to the small life insurance company deduction 
the effective rate was approximately and in and  respectively 
the effective rate was much higher in  due to state and local income taxes on the parent company s investment gains along with an increased valuation allowance on deferred tax assets 
the small life insurance company deduction allows the life insurance subsidiaries to reduce their taxable income by before computing their current provisions for regular or alternative minimum tax 
however  for purposes of computing deferred income tax liabilities under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  the company is precluded from assuming the small life insurance company deduction will be available in the future 
accordingly  by disallowing this deduction  sfas no 
significantly increases the deferred taxes on the life insurance subsidiaries temporary differences 
thus  when a significant increase or decrease occurs in the company s net temporary differences  the related deferred tax is computed using the federal tax rate  whereas tax may actually be paid on these net liabilities when realized at a rate potentially as low as the alternative minimum tax rate after application of the allowable small life insurance company deduction 
the company s gross deferred federal income tax liabilities and assets are more fully discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
all deferred tax assets of the company are realizable by offset against existing deferred tax liabilities or by carryback to recapture prior years taxes paid on operating income and capital gains 
the deferred tax assets are offset  to some extent  by valuation allowances related to the company and to the life insurance subsidiaries 
due to the impact of the small life insurance company deduction  the life insurance subsidiaries record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets associated with temporary differences to their expected benefit rate of approximately  rather than 
the company s valuation allowance is designed to reduce deferred tax assets to their estimated ultimate realization value 
statutory insurance information 
for insurance regulatory and rating purposes  the insurance subsidiaries report on the basis of statutory accounting principles sap 
as described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  effective january  portions of sap were revised by a process called codification 
in recent years  various state insurance departments and the naic have expressed concern  essentially about the rate of return earned by holders of small face amount life policies  potentially including preneed policies 
although the company does not believe calculating a simple rate of return or premium pay back measure is meaningful for traditional life insurance products  certain state insurance regulators are considering actions that could alter the profitability of existing contracts or eliminate small face amount policies as a viable product offering 
during  am best company best affirmed citizens security s b rating 
this rating was previously lowered from a b in united liberty s rating has remained at b by best since it was acquired in  and citizens insurance  due to its lack of insurance operations  is not rated 
during december  citizens financial strengthened the statutory capital position of citizens security by acquiring  of citizens security redeemable preferred stock 
during january  citizens financial contributed of the capital stock of citizens insurance to citizens security 
the statutory value of this contribution was  citizens security has reported its investments in united liberty and citizens insurance on the equity method of accounting  since their acquisition in and  respectively 
however  beginning in  codification changed the statutory equity method of accounting to preclude a parent insurer from recording as income  its share of undistributed subsidiary earnings 
accordingly  citizens security s net income includes united liberty s net earnings of   and  in   and  respectively 
for and  citizens security reported as income the  and  respectively  of dividend distributions which it received from united liberty 
at december   citizens security reported its investments in united liberty and citizens insurance at their statutory equity values of  and  respectively 
to provide a more detailed understanding of citizens security s operations  shown below are sap basis net income  net operating income  statutory capital and surplus  asset reserves  and capital ratios for citizens security for the five years ended december  net statutory asset year ended net operating capital and valuation capital december income loss income loss surplus reserves ratio asset valuation reserves are statutory liabilities that act as contingency reserves in the event of extraordinary losses on invested assets and as a buffer for policyholders surplus to reduce the impact of realized and unrealized investment losses 
the through amounts also include united liberty s asset valuation reserves 
represents statutory capital and surplus plus asset valuation reserves divided by invested assets plus cash 
during  statutory capital and surplus and asset valuation reserves increased approximately  this increase resulted primarily from the  issuance of preferred stock described above  net of the  net loss for the year and  of unrealized losses 
during  statutory capital and surplus and asset valuation reserves increased approximately  this increase resulted primarily from the citizens insurance capital contribution noted above  plus  of unrealized gains offsetting the  net loss and a  increase in nonadmitted assets 
during  statutory capital and surplus and asset reserves decreased by approximately  this decrease resulted primarily from  of statutory net income offset by  of unrealized losses and a  redemption of citizens security s preferred capital stock 
during  statutory capital and surplus and asset reserves increased by approximately  this increase resulted primarily from  of statutory net income offset by a  redemption of preferred capital stock  and a  shareholder dividend paid 
during  statutory capital and surplus and asset reserves increased by approximately  this increase resulted primarily from  of statutory net income offset by a  redemption of preferred capital stock  along with unrealized investment gains 
in addition to the statutory totals shown above  citizens insurance generated statutory net income of approximately   and  during    and  respectively without remitting any dividends to its parent 
statutory capital and surplus  specifically the component called surplus  is used to fund the expansion of an insurance company s first year individual life and accident and health sales 
the first year commission and underwriting expenses on such sales will normally consume a very high percentage of  if not exceed  first year premiums 
accordingly  a statutory loss surplus strain often occurs on these sales during the first policy year 
historically  the company s level of life insurance sales has not significantly impacted statutory surplus 
however  as multi pay preneed life sales increase  the company anticipates that surplus strain will dampen statutory earnings 
cash flow and liquidity due to losses during the past three years and the adverse impact of the low interest rate environment on operating results  during the company borrowed  from its chairman to strengthen the statutory capital position of its principal insurance subsidiary 
the company also has  of commercial bank debt outstanding  with scheduled repayments due through during  the company did not comply with a loan covenant debt to earnings ratio on this debt and received a waiver of such violation through december  however  since the company is not assured of meeting this covenant throughout  the full balance of  can be considered payable within one year 
although the company does not expect the full balance to be called during  it believes such an obligation could be met through a refinancing arrangement or sale of selected assets or a block of insurance business 
regarding the currently scheduled debt repayments  the company believes its available funds will be adequate to service debt obligations and  with other available assets  will probably be adequate to service debt obligations through in addition  the company s chairman has expressed potential willingness to loan the company an additional  if necessary  which could service debt obligations through the majority of additional information regarding debt obligations is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company is completing a strategic review of its products and operations 
a key element of this initiative is mitigating the significant losses incurred on the preneed life business segment and strengthening profitability in the broker life and home service life segments 
the company generated approximately  and  of cash flow from operations during and  respectively  while using  of cash from operations in the and increases are principally attributable to growth of preneed life premium collections 
the decrease is principally attributable to federal income tax deposits required early in the year 
cash used by investment activities of  and  during and respectively  relates primarily to investing additional preneed life premiums in fixed maturity securities  although the total also includes investing  of cash and short term balances outstanding at december  cash provided by investment activities during of  resulted primarily from a reduction in equity portfolio positions and net cash received from acquisition of the nail business  partially offset by additional property and equipment expenditures  including a fractional aircraft ownership share 
the  of cash used by financing activities during includes  of debt repayments and  of net withdrawals of policyholder deposits  partially offset by additional borrowings of  cash used by financing activities during includes net withdrawals of policyholder deposits of approximately  debt repayments of  and common stock repurchases of  cash used by financing activities during includes net withdrawals of policyholder deposits of approximately  and debt repayments of  the policyholder deposit withdrawals are principally due to the company s decision not to aggressively compete in crediting higher interest returns on such funds 
the company is subject to various market risks 
however  the most significant such risks relate to fluctuations in prices of equity securities and interest rates 
although the company experienced negative total returns on its equity portfolio during the past three years  historically these returns have been very favorable and the company has successfully managed the risk of equity security price fluctuations over many years 
as described above  the company does not anticipate that investment markets will continue to deteriorate at the rate encountered during the past three years 
the company and its investment advisory firm  smc advisors  inc  devote significant attention to the equity markets and reposition the company s portfolio upon detection of adverse risk trends associated with individual securities or overall markets 
smc advisors  inc also manages market risks associated with investments in option securities  as described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the fair value of the company s equity portfolio was approximately  and  at december  and  respectively 
accordingly  a decline in equity prices would have reduced the fair value of the company s equity portfolio by  and  at december  and  respectively 
the average cost value of the company s equity portfolio was  and  during and  respectively 
regarding interest rate risk  the value of the company s fixed maturity investment portfolio will increase or decrease in an inverse relationship with fluctuations in interest rates while net investment income earned on newly acquired fixed maturities increases or decreases in direct relationship with interest rate changes 
management estimates that a basis point increase in interest rates rate shock would have decreased the fair value of its million fixed maturity portfolio by approximately or million at december and or million at december  from an income perspective  the company does not believe rising interest rates present a significant risk  as essentially all of the company s policy liabilities bear fixed rates 
however  approximately of policy liabilities contain provisions permitting interest or benefit adjustments at the discretion of the boards of directors of the insurance subsidiaries 
the company s cash flow testing described below indicates that overall profitability will generally be enhanced in rising interest rate scenarios 
from a liquidity perspective  the company s fixed rate policy liabilities have been relatively insensitive to interest rate fluctuations 
accordingly  the company believes gradual increases in interest rates do not present a significant liquidity exposure 
the company monitors economic conditions on a regular basis and manages this interest rate risk primarily by adjusting the duration of its fixed maturity portfolio 
historically  the company has maintained conservative durations in its fixed maturity portfolio 
at december  cash and fixed maturity investments with maturities of less than five years equaled approximately of total policy liabilities 
notwithstanding the foregoing  if interest rates rise significantly in a short timeframe  there can be no assurance that the life insurance industry  including the company  would not experience increased levels of surrenders and reduced sales  and thereby be materially adversely affected 
interest expense on the company s debt varies quarterly and is therefore also subject to interest rate risk 
for its commercial bank debt  the company elects the lower of the prime lending rate or the one month libor rate plus 
for its related party debt  the interest rate is the higher of or the commercial bank prime lending rate plus 
at december   the weighted average rate on the company s  of borrowings was 
the company believes its current liquidity position and profitability levels are adequate to guard against this interest rate risk 
in addition to the measures described above  the life insurance subsidiaries comply with the naic promulgated standard valuation law svl which specifies minimum reserve levels and prescribes methods for determining them  with the intent of enhancing solvency 
the svl also requires the company to perform annual cash flow testing for its life insurance subsidiaries 
this testing is designed to ensure that statutory reserve levels will maintain adequate protection in a variety of potential interest rate scenarios 
the actuarial standards board of the american academy of actuaries also requires cash flow testing as a basis for the actuarial opinion on the adequacy of the reserves which is a required part of the annual statutory reporting process 
cash flow testing projects cash inflows from assets and cash outflows for liabilities in various assumed economic and yield curve scenarios 
this is a dynamic process  whereby the performance of the assets and liabilities is directly related to the scenario assumptions 
an example would involve the credited interest rate on annuity products and how such rates vary depending upon projected earnings rates  which are based upon asset performance under a particular economic scenario 
the life insurance subsidiaries most recent cash flow testing  which was completed in february  involved a review of two basic measures 
the first was the value of free market surplus  which is defined as the difference between the projected market value of assets and liabilities at the end of the analysis period typically years 
deficits could indicate the need for corrective action depending upon the severity and the number of scenarios in which a deficit appeared 
a second measure involved distributable earnings 
negative earnings for extended durations might impair the ability of the life insurance subsidiaries to continue without exhausting surplus 
again  depending upon severity and frequency  corrective measures might be needed 
based on results of the testing  no corrective measures were indicated at the current time 
however  such testing is ongoing and dynamic in nature and future events in the interest and equity markets or a significant change in the composition of life insurance subsidiaries business could negatively impact testing results and require the initiation of corrective measures 
any necessary corrective measures could take one or more forms 
the duration of existing assets might not match well with those of the liabilities 
certain liabilities  such as those associated with indemnity accident and health  short term disability and group dental products  are short term in nature and are best matched with cash and short term investments 
by contrast  whole life insurance  which involves lifetime obligations  is usually best matched by longer duration maturities 
in the event there are insufficient assets of these types  a repositioning of the investment portfolio might be undertaken 
initially balanced durations do not guarantee positive future results 
asset type  quality  and yield will vary depending upon the economic scenario tested 
liabilities will be similarly affected 
projected reinvestment yields may cause overall yields to fall below those required to support projected liabilities 
in that event  portfolio realignment might involve the type  quality and yield of investments rather than duration 
alternatively  additional reserve amounts could be allocated to cover any future shortfalls 
the above discussion centers around asset management 
other possible corrective measures might involve liability realignment 
the company s marketing plan could be modified to emphasize certain product types and reduce others 
new business levels could be varied in order to find the optimum level
