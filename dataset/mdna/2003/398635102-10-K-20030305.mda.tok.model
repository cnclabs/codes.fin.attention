for stock based compensation for its first quarter of fiscal year critical accounting policies financial reporting release no 
 which was recently released by the securities and exchange commission  requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the following is a brief discussion of the more significant accounting policies and methods used by us 
general the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
the most significant estimates and assumptions relate to the recoverability of internally developed software costs  fixed assets and other intangibles  inventories  realization of deferred income taxes and the adequacy of allowances for doubtful accounts 
actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates 
accounts receivable we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers  third party and vendor receivables and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
inventories we value our inventory at the lower of cost or market with cost determined under the retail method 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory where appropriate based primarily on our historical shrink and spoilage rates 
intangibles and other long lived assets property  plant and equipment  intangible and certain other long lived assets are amortized over their useful lives 
useful lives are based on management s estimates of the period that the assets will generate revenue 
intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
accrued self insurance insurance expense for employee related health care benefits are estimated using historical experience 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flow of the company due to adverse changes in financing rates 
the company is exposed to market risk in the area of interest rates 
this exposure is directly related to its term loan and borrowing activities under the working capital facility 
the company does not currently maintain any interest rate hedging arrangements due to the reasonable risk that near term interest rates will not rise significantly 
the company is continuously evaluating this risk and will consider implementing interest rate hedging arrangements when deemed appropriate
