item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the financial data related to the precision lens business which was sold in the fourth quarter of is reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
see note to the consolidated financial statements and results of discontinued operations below 
overview during corning continued the restructuring efforts that began in the second quarter of the telecommunications industry continued to decline over the course of the year as the trends exhibited in such as softness in demand  excess capacity  increased intensity of competition and growing pressure on price and profits have persisted 
major carriers have reduced capital spending for a variety of reasons  some of which include network over capacity  bankruptcy of key telecommunications customers and suppliers and the overall economic uncertainties in the world economy 
the significant lack of capital spending by these carriers resulted in drastically reduced sales volumes for corning in as a result  corning continued to see revenues decline in its telecommunications segment and thus incurred significant losses again in these current business conditions caused corning to revise future expectations for its telecommunications segment which resulted in the recognition of the following fourth quarter charges in 
a pre tax charge of million million after tax to impair a portion of the goodwill in its telecommunications segment  and 
a pre tax charge of million million after tax to impair tangible and intangible assets in its photonic technologies business 
in addition  corning recorded the following fourth quarter charges in 
a pre tax charge of million million after tax and minority interest to impair tangible assets in its conventional video components business due to the maturation of the conventional television market in north america  and 
a pre tax charge of million million after tax for restructuring actions  primarily in the telecommunications segment that resulted in recording a total of billion of restructuring and impairment charges for the full year 
corning took the following actions to compensate for a decrease in cash from operations and preserve liquidity 
in december  corning completed the sale of its precision lens business for approximately million and recorded a gain of million million after tax  
in july  corning issued million shares of series c mandatory convertible preferred stock which generated net proceeds of million and declared a one time dividend of million on the offering  and 
from time to time throughout the year  corning retired zero coupon convertible debentures with an accreted value of million for cash of million and recorded total gains of million million after tax 
corning also spent a total of million to repay its commercial paper borrowings and a portion of other long term debt 
results of continuing operations selected highlights from corning s continuing operations were as follows in millions  except per share amounts and percentages net sales    gross margin   gross margin selling  general and administrative expenses   as a of revenues research  development and engineering expenses as a of revenues amortization of goodwill as a of revenues operating loss income   as a of revenues loss income from continuing operations   as a of revenues net sales consolidated net sales for were billion  a decrease of  or billion  from sales of billion 
the sales decline was most pronounced in the telecommunications segment where significantly lower demand and price declines for corning s optical fiber and cable and photonic technologies products drove a sales decline in that segment of  or billion year to year 
sales in the technologies segment for decreased  or million  compared to consolidated net sales for decreased  or million from net sales of billion 
excluding the impact of acquisitions  corning s consolidated sales in decreased  compared to sales declines for occurred in both operating segments  but were most pronounced in the telecommunications segment where sales fell 
gross margin as a percentage of net sales  gross margin decreased from to in gross margin continued to be impacted by lower sales volumes in the telecommunications segment where the lower volumes were insufficient to cover the fixed manufacturing costs 
downward pricing pressure also continued to negatively impact gross margins  primarily in the optical fiber and cable business 
these negative trends were offset by significant fixed cost reductions as manufacturing capacity was shut down 
gross margin in the technologies segment decreased approximately points from in  gross margin decreased to from in the decrease was primarily due to the loss of sales volume in premium fiber and photonics products and a total of million of charges for the write down of inventory in the photonic technologies business over the second and fourth quarters of selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses decreased to million in while sg a increased points as a percentage of net sales to over the decrease in sg a for the year reflected the cost savings which resulted from the restructuring actions which began in  while the increase as a percentage of net sales indicated the decline in revenues continued to outpace the cost benefit of restructuring actions 
management expects sg a as a percentage of sales to decline in as a result of restructuring actions 
sg a increased in over to  million  while sg a as a percentage of net sales also increased points over the increase was primarily due to a million charge related to the release of restrictions on shares of corning common stock held by employees partially offset by the benefits of cost reduction activities 
the compensation committee removed the restrictions on approximately million shares  primarily because they were no longer effective as a retention tool due to the sharp reduction in share price from their grant date 
research  development and engineering research  development and engineering expenses rd e totaled million for  which represented a decline of  compared to as a percentage of net sales  rd e increased points from the decrease in expense for the year reflected the impact of the restructuring actions  while the increase as a percentage of net sales was caused by the decline in revenues 
management expects to continue to invest in rd e in  but expects rd e to decline to of sales 
in  rd e increased to million from  while rd e as a percentage of net sales increased points over the increase as a percentage of sales was due to higher spending and lower revenues in  compared to amortization of goodwill effective january   corning adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which eliminated the amortization of goodwill 
the new standard is discussed further under new accounting standards and note to the consolidated financial statements 
amortization of goodwill totaled million million after tax in  compared to million million after tax in amortization of goodwill increased in as it included charges for the entire year related to transactions completed late in the amortization of goodwill was reduced by the impairment of goodwill charge taken in the second quarter of operating loss income corning incurred a significant operating loss of billion in the loss was primarily due to restructuring charges and goodwill and asset impairments totaling billion 
further discussion of these charges begins under restructuring  impairment and other charges 
the operating loss of billion is largely attributable to a charge of approximately billion billion after tax in the second quarter to impair goodwill and certain other intangible assets of the photonic technologies business 
corning s results for were also impacted by charges for restructuring actions of million  which included charges for headcount reductions  exit costs and impairment of plant and equipment  an operating charge of million to write down excess and obsolete inventory  a million charge related to the release of restrictions on shares of corning common stock and a million charge to write down an investment in intellectual property 
corning s results included purchased in process research and development iprd charges of million and other acquisition related charges of million 
gain on repurchases and retirement of debt corning repurchased and retired zero coupon convertible debentures with an accreted value of million in exchange for cash of million resulting in gains of million million after tax on these transactions for the year ended december  see liquidity and capital resources 
income taxes corning s benefit provision for income taxes and the related effective benefit income tax rates for continuing operations were as follows in millions for the years ended december  benefit provision for income taxes effective benefit income tax rate the effective benefit rate in was impacted by restructuring  impairment and other charges and the gain on repurchases of debt 
the effective benefit rate without consideration of these items was for the effective income tax benefit rate for the year is lower than the us statutory income tax rate of due to the impact of nondeductible expenses and losses 
the effective income tax benefit rate for was much lower than the us statutory income tax rate  primarily due to non tax deductible amortization of acquired intangibles and goodwill  which partially offset the us statutory income tax benefit rate 
the effective income tax rate for was much higher than the us statutory income tax rate  primarily due to non tax deductible amortization of acquired intangibles and goodwill  in addition to the write offs of non tax deductible iprd 
note to the consolidated financial statements reconciles the statutory tax rate to the effective tax rate 
equity earnings equity earnings in were million and declined from  primarily due to the impairment of an equity investment in the second quarter of for million and a million reduction in equity earnings in the fourth quarter  primarily due to restructuring and impairment charges recorded by samsung corning micro optics 
excluding these items  equity earnings approximated those in as a percentage of net sales  equity earnings increased points over  primarily due to the decline in sales 
equity earnings in were million and relatively flat  compared to as a percentage of net sales  equity earnings were also relatively flat  compared to in the first quarter of  corning discontinued recognition of equity earnings from pittsburgh corning corporation pcc and recorded a charge to impair its investment for million due to pcc s decision to file for bankruptcy protection and reorganization under chapter for asbestos litigation 
see legal proceedings and note to the consolidated financial statements for further detail 
loss income from continuing operations as a result of the above  the loss income from continuing operations and per share data were as follows in millions  except per share amounts for the years ended december  loss income from continuing operations   basic loss earnings per common share from continuing operations diluted loss earnings per common share from continuing operations shares used in computing per share amounts basic  diluted  results of discontinued operations precision lens business on december   corning completed the sale of its cincinnati  oh precision lens business to m company m 
this business manufactures precision lens assemblies for projection video systems 
corning sold the precision lens business for cash proceeds up to million  of which million has been deposited in an escrow account 
a portion of the escrow account balance will be used to pay state income taxes relating to the transaction 
the remaining balance plus accrued interest will be paid to corning in december  subject to any amounts due to m relating to certain indemnifications made by corning 
the transaction price is also subject to adjustment due to changes in working capital between signing and closing 
in  proceeds from the sale of precision lens were approximately million in cash 
the gain on the sale was million  net of tax  which has been recorded in income from discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations 
in  corning could record an additional gain on the sale of up to million  net of tax 
this amount is conditional upon the ultimate amount paid to corning from the escrow account 
management currently expects to receive additional proceeds of million from m in the first quarter of and million in the fourth quarter of  which is currently held in escrow 
the precision lens business is accounted for as a discontinued operation and therefore  the results of operations and cash flows have been removed from corning s results of continuing operations for all periods presented 
the precision lens business was part of corning s former information display segment 
the results of operations for the precision lens business have been excluded from the operating segments data 
sales from discontinued operations increased  or million in  compared to the increase was primarily due to continued strong volume growth for digital projection televisions  particularly in north america and asia  driven by demand for larger size televisions in the entertainment market sector 
excluding the gain on sale  earnings for the business increased more than over to million as sales volume gains and manufacturing efficiencies from new capacity were realized 
sales from discontinued operations increased  or million in  compared to the increase was due to the growth of digital projection televisions in the us and in china where the demand for high definition television was growing 
despite the increase in sales  earnings for decreased approximately to million  primarily due to manufacturing costs related to capacity expansion of projection television assemblies 
summarized selected financial information for the discontinued operations related to the precision lens business is as follows in millions for the years ended december  net sales income before taxes gain on sale before taxes provision for income taxes net income distribution of shares of quest diagnostics and covance inc on december   corning distributed shares of quest diagnostics incorporated and covance inc  which collectively comprised corning s health care services segment  to its shareholders on a pro rata basis the distributions 
corning agreed to indemnify quest diagnostics on an after tax basis for the settlement of certain government claims and against certain other claims that were pending at december  coincident with the distributions  corning recorded a payable to quest diagnostics of approximately million  which was management s best estimate of amounts which were probable of being paid by corning to quest diagnostics to satisfy the remaining indemnified claims on an after tax basis 
quest diagnostics settled a significant matter with the department of justice late in requiring corning to reimburse quest diagnostics million 
as a result  in the fourth quarter of corning released reserves totaling million after tax in excess of the indemnified settlement between quest diagnostics and the department of justice 
outlook corning expects net sales to approximate  reflecting a year over year decline in the telecommunications segment and an improvement in the technologies segment 
corning also expects  at a minimum  to significantly reduce operating losses in versus as a result of restructuring actions in the second half of in telecommunications and an expected strong performance in technologies 
corning s goal is to return to profitability in before consideration of restructuring or other one time charges 
corning s goal to return to profitability is dependent upon stabilization of revenues and continued strength in north america and world economies 
corning will begin recognizing equity earnings from dow corning corporation in the first quarter of corning does not expect to receive any dividends from dow corning in for the first quarter of  corning expects sales in the range of million to million 
corning expects a net loss in the range of per share to per share  excluding gains on debt repurchases and restructuring charges in the quarter 
this loss is net of expected equity earnings in the range of million to million from dow corning 
management continues to believe corning has sufficient liquidity to meet its funding needs for and beyond 
corning finished the year with billion in cash and short term investments and full access to an unused revolving credit facility of billion 
capital spending is expected to approximate million to million in the anticipated spending will focus primarily on the planned expansion in the liquid crystal display and environmental businesses 
restructuring  impairment and other charges corning recorded significant charges in and these charges are summarized in the following table and discussed in the following three subsections of management discussion and analysis in millions for the years ended december  impairment of goodwill  restructuring actions  impairment of long lived assets other than goodwill photonic technologies business conventional video components business total restructuring  impairment and other charges   impairment of goodwill charge as discussed in new accounting standards and note to the consolidated financial statements  in january  corning adopted sfas no 
 which requires companies to stop amortizing goodwill and certain intangible assets with an indefinite useful life 
instead  sfas no 
requires that goodwill be reviewed for impairment upon adoption of sfas no 
january  and annually thereafter 
corning performed an initial benchmark assessment upon adoption at january   and determined that a transition charge was not required 
corning chose the fourth quarter to conduct its annual impairment test 
under sfas no 
 goodwill impairment occurs if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
the majority of corning s goodwill is included in the telecommunications reporting unit  which is the same as the telecommunications segment 
the test completed in the fourth quarter indicated that the recorded book value of this reporting unit exceeded its fair value  as determined by discounted cash flows 
management believes the telecommunication industry is currently depressed but will ultimately recover 
management does not expect growth in this segment in the short term  but believes that growth will return to this segment by corning s view that the industry will recover is based on the fact that bandwidth demand continues to grow currently  and the belief that a combination of public policy changes  consolidation and recovery of industry players  and the advancement of profitable broadband business models will drive recovery in the future 
the decrease in fair value from that measured in the benchmark assessment primarily reflects 
a delay in the timing of the expected recovery from late  or early to  
a reduction in the short term cash flow expectations of the fiber and cable business and a lower base from which the expected recovery will occur  and 
a reduction in the short and long term cash flow expectations of the photonic technologies business 
management retained valuation specialists to assist in the valuation of its tangible and identifiable intangible assets for purposes of determining the implied fair value of goodwill at december  upon completion of the annual assessment  corning recorded a non cash impairment charge of million million after tax to reduce the carrying value of goodwill in the telecommunications reporting unit to its estimated fair value of billion 
management cannot provide assurance that future impairment charges will not be required if the telecommunications industry does not recover as projected by management in its expected future cash flow estimates 
management must exercise judgment in assessing the recoverability of goodwill 
see critical accounting estimates for related discussion 
charge during the first half of  corning experienced a significant decrease in the rate of growth of its telecommunications segment  primarily in the photonic technologies business  due to a dramatic decline in infrastructure spending in the telecommunications industry 
during the second quarter  major customers in the photonic technologies business reduced their order forecasts and canceled orders already placed 
as a result  management determined that the growth prospects of this business were significantly less than previously expected and those of historical periods 
corning reviews the recoverability of its long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangible assets  when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
as a result of the business conditions noted above  corning concluded such an assessment was required for its photonic technologies business in the second quarter 
corning assesses recoverability of the carrying value based upon cumulative expected future pre tax cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges of the related operations 
as a result of this test  corning determined that the long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangibles related to the acquisition of the pirelli optical components and devices business the pirelli transaction in december  as well as those of the unit into which netoptix corporation acquired in may had been integrated  were not recoverable under sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  which was the governing us generally accepted accounting principle gaap guidance at that time 
the impairment assessment was performed at these levels as discrete cash flows were available for these divisions within the photonic technologies business 
corning s policy is to write down long lived assets to fair value in such circumstances 
management estimated fair value using several techniques 
while each method generated comparable fair values  management adjusted the assets to estimates based on average multiples of forecasted revenues and earnings of comparable publicly traded companies with operations in the optical component market segment 
this valuation method is consistent with that used in the original valuation of the acquisitions of net optix and certain assets from the pirelli transaction 
the fair value of these assets were lower in june from their acquisition dates as market multiples had changed from those reflected in transactions consummated in in the second quarter of  corning recorded pre tax charges of  million to impair a significant portion of goodwill and million to impair other intangible assets 
of the total goodwill charge of  million   million related to the pirelli transaction and  million related to goodwill resulting from the acquisition of netoptix corporation 
in the second quarter of  it was determined that there were events of impairment within portions of the photonic technologies business 
the accounting literature effective at that time sfas no 
required that intangible assets be assessed for recoverability at the lowest level for which discrete cash flows can be measured 
as a result of this analysis  corning recorded a charge of million to impair a portion of the patents acquired in the pirelli transaction 
the valuation methods from which this results are described above 
restructuring actions restructuring actions the continued decline in demand in the telecommunications segment during required additional restructuring beyond that taken in to bring manufacturing capacity in line with revenue projections 
corning recorded a total of billion in pre tax charges over the second  third and fourth quarters 
actions approved and initiated in included the following 
permanent closing of corning s optical fiber manufacturing facilities in noble park  victoria  australia  and neustadt bei coburg  germany 
corning also mothballed its optical fiber manufacturing facility in concord  nc and transferred certain capabilities to its wilmington  nc facility  
reductions in capacity and employment in corning s cabling and hardware and equipment locations worldwide to reduce costs  
permanent closure of its photonic technologies thin film filter manufacturing facility in marlborough  ma  
permanent abandonment of certain construction projects that had been stopped in in the fiber and cable business within the telecommunications segment  
closure of minor manufacturing facilities  primarily in the telecommunications segment  
closure and consolidation of research facilities  
elimination of positions worldwide through voluntary and involuntary programs  and 
divestiture of a portion of the controls and connectors business in the telecommunications segment 
in addition  corning impaired cost based investments in a number of private telecommunications companies based upon a decision in the fourth quarter of to divest the portfolio 
restructuring charges the restructuring charges of million included million of employee separation costs including special termination and curtailment losses related to pension and postretirement health care plans  million in other exit costs principally lease termination and contract cancellation payments and a million credit related to the restructuring actions 
the charge entailed the elimination of approximately  hourly and salaried positions in the telecommunications segment and corporate research and administrative staffs organizations 
employees have been informed of the restructuring initiatives and benefits available to them under applicable benefit plans 
these benefits included involuntary separation  early retirement and social programs 
impairment of plant and equipment corning has evaluated the carrying value of the long lived assets at each site impacted by the restructuring actions for impairment 
the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired when the anticipated separately identifiable undiscounted cash flows from that asset are less than the carrying value of the asset 
the impairment charges were determined based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeded the fair market value of the asset 
corning recorded million in to impair plant and equipment related to facilities to be shutdown or disposed  primarily in the fiber and cable business  the photonic technologies business and certain research facilities 
the charge was partially offset by an million adjustment to assumed salvage values on asset disposals  related to the restructuring actions 
of the total charge  million pertained to abandoned construction projects in the fiber and cable business  primarily the latest expansion in concord  nc and oklahoma city  ok 
a significant portion of the assets impaired were recently acquired  or built in connection with capacity expansions in anticipation of future demand 
most of the impaired facilities are currently available for sale  others will be demolished or abandoned 
the remaining impaired equipment will be auctioned  sold  disposed of or abandoned during loss on divestiture in the second quarter of  corning completed the sale of its appliance controls group which was included in the controls and connectors business in the telecommunications segment 
in the second and third quarter of  corning received cash of million  note proceeds of million and recorded a loss on the sale of approximately million million after tax which is included in impairment charges 
impairment of cost investments during the second and fourth quarters of  corning recorded total charges of million million after tax for other than temporary declines in certain cost investments in the telecommunications segment 
in the fourth quarter  corning decided to divest its remaining portfolio of cost investments in private telecommunications related companies 
these investments have been written down to their estimated fair value based upon information available from prospective purchasers

although corning expects the remaining employees to be separated by december   the majority of these employees will be separated by the end of the first quarter of corning expects approximately one third of the restructuring charges to be paid in cash 
if the restructuring actions are successfully implemented  corning expects such actions to yield approximately million in annual savings 
the savings consist of lower wage and benefit costs  avoided depreciation and fixed costs on closed facilities 
approximately of the savings from the restructuring actions will be realized in cost of sales with the remainder split between selling  general and administrative and research  development and engineering expenses 
restructuring actions in july and october of  corning announced a series of restructuring actions in response to significant deteriorating business conditions which began initially in its telecommunications segment  but eventually spread to its other businesses as the year progressed 
the following actions were approved and undertaken in 
closure of seven major manufacturing facilities and the consolidation of several smaller facilities  in the telecommunications and technologies segments  
discontinuation of its initiative in corning microarray technology products  part of corning s life sciences business  and 
elimination of approximately  positions affecting all operating segments  but especially impacting the photonic technologies  hardware and equipment and the optical fiber and cable businesses 
this action included a selective voluntary early retirement program for certain employees along with involuntary separations 
these actions resulted in a pre tax charge totaling million million after tax and minority interest for the year ended december  the charge included restructuring costs of million and million for the impairment of plant and equipment of which million and million  respectively related to discontinued operations 
approximately one third of the total charge was expected to be paid in cash

the telecommunications market is undergoing a dramatic decline in demand for telecommunication products as major buyers of network equipment in this industry have reduced their capital spending plans over the past two years and are expected to continue such reductions in the near future 
the lack of demand for optical component products started in early and resulted in restructuring and impairment charges in and this negative trend is expected to continue into the foreseeable future 
as disclosed in corning s third quarter form q  certain competitors indicated that they will exit the business and others announced decisions to consolidate or restructure 
corning continues to evaluate strategic alternatives for this business 
while certain product lines are promising in the event of industry recovery  the pace and extent of that recovery is uncertain 
alternatives under consideration for this business include staying in the business with scaled down operations or contract manufacturing  partnering  sale or abandonment 
in february  corning announced it would close its optical switching product line and record a pre tax charge of million to million in the first quarter of as short term projections reflect continued operating and cash losses and the long term expectations are uncertain  it was determined that the long lived assets of this business property  plant and equipment and patents should be evaluated for impairment 
the impairment evaluation required management to develop operating cash flow projections for each strategic alternative and make assessments as to the probability of each outcome 
it was determined that the long lived assets of this business were not recoverable through future cash flows 
the assets were written down to estimated salvage value  as this amount is the best reflection of fair value 
this resulted in a million million after tax write down of the assets  which was reflected in the line item restructuring  impairment and other charges in the consolidated statements of operations 
the charge included million related to patents 
the estimate of salvage value is an area of management judgement 
see critical accounting estimates for related discussion 
the remaining long term assets of this business approximate million and are classified as held for use 
conventional video components business corning asahi video products company  a owned consolidated subsidiary  conventional video components business  is a manufacturer of glass panels and funnels for use in conventional tube televisions and is reported in the technologies segment for sfas no 
reporting 
the conventional tube television segment of the market in north america is very mature and highly competitive 
the market has been impacted by a decline in demand for conventional television glass associated with shifting consumer preference for flat panel and projection television sets  as well as other competing technologies 
the segment has also been impacted by dramatic increases in the importation of television glass  tubes and sets from asia 
the conventional television tube market is undergoing intense competition at this time and as a result is experiencing tremendous price pressure 
one major customer has already exited this market and industry consolidation continues 
demand from another key customer is uncertain 
competition from imported products has increased significantly within the last year  while the demand for flat screen televisions has been increasing for several years 
these trends are expected to continue into the foreseeable future 
these market trends combined with cash losses in this business in the short term indicated an evaluation for the recoverability of the long lived assets of the business was required and management determined that the long lived assets of the business have been impaired 
the impairment evaluation required management to develop operating cash flow projections for each strategic alternative and make assessments as to the probability of each outcome 
it was determined that the long lived assets were not recoverable through future cash flows 
management estimated the fair value of the long lived assets  which were limited to property  plant and equipment  using the expected cash flow approach as a measure of fair value 
this resulted in a million million after tax and minority interest write down of the assets  which was reflected in the line item restructuring  impairment and other charges in the consolidated statements of operations 
the cash flow realized by this business will be impacted by actions taken by competitors and customers 
should our future performance differ adversely from our projections  corning could be required to record additional impairment charges 
it is also possible that corning could choose to exit the business should cash flows be less than projected 
the remaining net assets of this business approximate million 
operating segments corning previously grouped its products into three operating segments telecommunications  advanced materials and information display 
beginning in the fourth quarter of  corning s reportable segments consist of the following telecommunications and technologies 
as a result of the fourth quarter sale of the precision lens business and the reduced significance of the conventional video components business  management realigned the remainder of the information display segment with the businesses previously reported in advanced materials to create the technologies segment 
the precision lens business is reported as a discontinued operation and therefore its results have been excluded from segment reporting and historical periods have been conformed to this presentation 
also  in the second quarter of  corning revised its definition of segment net income 
prior to the second quarter  corning disclosed restructuring and impairment charges and acquisition related charges by segment  but excluded these from quantitative segment results 
these charges have now been included in the segment net income and historical periods have been conformed to this presentation 
this change was made to increase the transparency of the impact of these charges on segment results 
corning excludes the restructuring and impairment charges and acquisition related charges in discussing the results of each business in the segment to provide clarity on the underlying business trends 
corning also includes the earnings of equity affiliates that are closely associated with corning s operating segments in segment net income

the following table provides net sales for the telecommunications segment telecommunications in millions net sales optical fiber and cable   hardware and equipment  photonic technologies  controls and connectors total net sales    vs 
this segment incurred significant restructuring and impairment charges in and the and charges are described in detail in restructuring  impairment and other charges 
the restructuring activities were undertaken to reduce the operating cost structure due to continued market declines 
more than half of the charge is impairment of fixed assets  primarily in the fiber and cable business 
a significant portion of the asset impairments in this business represent the closure of two fiber plants and permanent abandonment of certain construction projects that had been stopped in in the optical fiber and cable business 
the balance of the charge represents impairments of cost based investments  primarily in the photonic technologies business  and severance and benefits for retirees and separated personnel in all businesses 
in addition  the segment incurred a million charge for the impairment of goodwill and a million charge for long lived asset impairments at photonic technologies 
the impairment charge incurred in the second quarter of relates to goodwill and certain acquired intangible assets from acquisitions in the photonic technologies business 
these charges are described in impairment of goodwill and impairment of other long lived assets 
sales in the segment declined  or  million  from as each business in the segment experienced a significant decline in volume with the largest declines in optical fiber and cable and the photonic technologies businesses 
the segment incurred losses of billion in  compared to a net loss of billion in the loss was primarily due to the significant decrease in sales volume and restructuring and impairment charges 
each business also reported a loss in the trend between years reflects lower restructuring and impairment charges 
excluding these restructuring and impairment charges  segment net loss was million compared to a loss of million in the increase in the loss in reflects reduced sales volumes and lower prices in each business offset by cost reductions resulting from restructuring actions 
the optical fiber and cable business is the largest business in the segment 
sales in the optical fiber and cable business declined  or  million in the decrease was primarily due to a sales volume decline for fiber and cable products of more than for the year as well as double digit price declines 
excluding restructuring and impairment charges  the optical fiber and cable business incurred a significant loss in  compared to profits in the prior year  primarily due to significantly lower sales volume  declining prices and unfavorable product mix 
as discussed in restructuring actions  the optical fiber and cable business undertook significant restructuring actions in the fourth quarter 
these actions included permanent closure of two international fiber manufacturing plants and the mothballing of the concord  nc facility 
in addition  cabling operations will continue to be consolidated 
corning is not exiting any product or business lines as a result of the decision to reduce capacity  but is adjusting capacity to most efficiently meet expected demand levels through at least the end of management believes that the concord facility can be returned to productive capacity within six to nine months of a decision to do so and construction in progress at the concord facility can be completed efficiently 
management believes the concord and wilmington plants will provide sufficient capacity for the foreseeable future of this business 
sales in the hardware and equipment business decreased  or million  compared to the sales decreases were primarily due to the overall lack of spending impacting the entire telecommunications industry 
excluding restructuring charges  the business incurred a loss driven by lower volumes and pricing pressure in  compared to a near breakeven performance in this business also undertook restructuring actions in the fourth quarter 
these actions included exiting certain product lines  headcount reductions and asset abandonments 
the photonic technologies business manufactures photonic modules and components  primarily for the optical amplification market 
sales in the photonic technologies business declined  or million  compared to  primarily due to lower sales volume as network buildouts in the telecommunications industry declined resulting in much lower demand for photonic products 
the business incurred a significant loss for before restructuring and impairment charges  primarily due to dramatically lower sales volumes 
however  the losses decreased more than  compared to the losses incurred in  which included inventory writedowns of million 
the results in reflect cost reductions resulting from restructuring actions taken in and during the second quarter of  the business favorably resolved an open issue from the second quarter of with a major customer  resulting in the recognition of revenue of million and pre tax income of million 
this revenue was recognized in part on shipment of inventory previously reserved 
in addition  the business settled an open matter with a significant vendor in resulting in the reversal of a vendor reserve of million that was recorded as part of the charge in the second quarter of the lack of demand for optical component products started in early and resulted in restructuring and impairment charges in and this negative trend is expected to continue into the foreseeable future 
as disclosed in corning s third quarter form q  certain competitors indicated that they will exit the business and others announced decisions to consolidate or restructure 
corning continues to evaluate strategic alternatives for this business 
while certain product lines are promising in the event of industry recovery  the pace and extent of that recovery is uncertain 
alternatives under consideration for this business include staying in the business with scaled down operations or contract manufacturing  partnering  sale or abandonment 
in february  corning announced it will stop commercialization of its optical switching product in and will incur pre tax charges of million to million related to the exit representing severance and cash exit costs 
management estimates that severance and exit costs related to a complete abandonment of remaining product lines could approximate million to million in total pre tax charges 
the controls and connectors business manufactures high performance oscillators and crystals used in various telecommunications applications 
sales in the controls and connectors business decreased  or million  compared to  due to the sale of the appliance controls group in may and the lack of capital spending in the telecommunications industry 
excluding restructuring charges  earnings were also down due to lower sales volumes as the business incurred a loss for the year  compared to earnings in the loss on divestiture of million million after tax is included in restructuring  impairment and other charges 
the business undertook restructuring actions in the fourth quarter that are expected to reduce operating costs in vs 
sales in the telecommunications segment decreased  or million from to billion 
excluding the impact of acquisitions  the sales decline was 
the decrease in sales was primarily due to sales volume decreases in most businesses throughout the segment as capital spending in the telecommunications industry decreased significantly 
segment net income fell precipitously  compared to s strong results as net income in the optical fiber and cable business was more than offset by losses in all other businesses and the significant restructuring and impairment charges 
the loss of sales volume in premium fiber and photonic products reduced gross margins and the segment incurred operating charges totaling million million after tax to write down excess and obsolete inventory  including estimated purchase commitments  further lowering gross margin percentages 
segment net income for was impacted by million million after tax of acquisition related charges  primarily iprd 
see iprd section for more detail 
sales in the optical fiber and cable business in remained flat at billion  compared with  although sales declined significantly in the fourth quarter of excluding the impact of acquisitions  sales declined  compared to the lack of growth reflects the loss of volume in premium products beginning in the second quarter due to the decline in long haul demand as capital spending for network buildouts diminished and the business began to experience volume decreases in sales of single mode fiber in the third quarter 
as a result  most fiber manufacturing facilities were idled in the fourth quarter 
overall  fiber and cable volume decreased approximately for the year as a result of an increase of approximately in the first half of the year  offset by a decrease of approximately in the second half 
the weighted average price for corning s optical fiber and cable products remained relatively stable  compared to  as higher prices were offset by significantly decreased volumes for premium products 
premium fiber as a percentage of total fiber demand was approximately in net income for the optical fiber and cable business decreased over  compared to  as the loss of sales volume in premium products was partially offset by increased sales of lower margin single mode products 
in response to reduced demand for fiber products  corning announced it will permanently close its optical fiber operations in deeside  north wales and its cabling operations in saskatoon  canada in addition to temporarily ceasing production at smaller cabling facilities 
sales in the hardware and equipment business declined  or million in  compared to excluding the impact of acquisitions  sales declined  compared to the decrease was primarily due to lower sales volumes as capital spending in the cable television industry fell significantly from prior year levels 
business performance decreased significantly to a small loss in primarily due to considerably lower sales volumes 
this business reduced its headcount during the year and closed a small manufacturing facility 
sales in the photonic technologies business declined  or million  compared to the sales decrease reflected significant declines in orders from major customers caused by the decrease in capital spending in the telecommunications industry 
the business incurred a significant operating loss for the year largely due to lower sales volumes  excess capacity  a higher fixed cost structure and charges for excess and obsolete inventory in the second and fourth quarters 
during the second quarter  major customers in the photonic technologies business reduced their order forecasts and canceled orders already placed 
as a result  management determined that certain products were not likely to be sold in their product life cycle 
corning recorded a charge to writedown excess and obsolete inventory  including estimated purchase commitments  of million million after tax in cost of sales in the second quarter of the business recorded an additional charge of million million after tax in the fourth quarter as a result of lower revenue forecasts for corning has  or is in the process of disposing all such inventory  except approximately million 
corning has retained and isolated this inventory  and in the unlikely event that product is sold  corning will fully disclose the impact on its margins 
corning announced a downsizing of the photonic technologies business and closed the following three manufacturing facilities in 
benton park facility in benton township  pa  
corning lasertron s facility in nashua  nh  and 
monroe park manufacturing and development operations in henrietta  ny 
in addition  corning scaled back its photonic technologies operations in erwin park  ny and the remainder of its photonic facilities to adjust its manufacturing capacity levels and headcount to lower revenue expectations 
the business reduced its headcount approximately from peak employment levels in sales in the controls and connectors business decreased  or million in  compared to lower sales volume was the primary reason for the decline due to the weak us economy 
the business incurred an insignificant loss for the year  compared to an insignificant profit in due to the depressed volume 
outlook business conditions in the telecommunications segment have been very difficult due to sharply reduced capital spending by telecommunications companies 
management anticipates that these difficult conditions will continue through at least the end of while management ultimately expects a recovery  it is difficult to forecast when capital spending by corning s customers will increase and therefore difficult to predict revenues and earnings in this segment in the short term 
corning expects sales to deteriorate million to million from sales 
the industry continues to experience significant excess capacity  resulting in pricing pressure that is expected to continue throughout corning expects the loss in the segment to be significantly less than due to significantly lower restructuring and impairment charges 
the results will also reflect cost savings from actions undertaken in technologies the technologies segment manufactures specialized products with unique properties for customer applications utilizing glass  glass ceramic and polymer technologies 
its primary products include liquid crystal display glass for flat panel displays  ceramic substrates for automobile and diesel applications  scientific laboratory products  glass panels and funnels for televisions and cathode ray tubes 
the following table provides net sales for the technologies segment technologies in millions net sales display technologies environmental technologies life sciences conventional video components other technologies businesses total net sales    vs 
sales in the technologies segment during decreased  or million  compared to  as increased sales in display technologies  environmental technologies and life sciences were offset by much lower sales in the mature conventional video components business  decreased demand for semiconductor materials and the impact of corning s exit of its lighting products line in segment earnings increased  or million  compared to  as improved operating performance in display technologies and the life sciences business and stronger equity earnings were partially offset by restructuring and impairment charges and decreased earnings in the semiconductor materials and conventional video components businesses 
the restructuring costs recorded in this segment consisted entirely of severance and benefits for retired and separated employees in several businesses 
the impairment charges related to assets held for use in the conventional video components business 
see impairment of long lived assets other than goodwill 
sales in the display technologies business  the largest business in the segment and a leading supplier of ultra thin glass substrates used to produce flat panel display  increased  or million  compared to the increase was primarily due to higher sales volume as penetration in the desktop market increased 
the prior year s sales were negatively impacted by an inventory correction in the industry in the first quarter of volume gains of over for the current year were partially offset by price declines of on a constant currency basis 
earnings in the business increased over for the year  compared to  primarily due to volume gains and a more than improvement in equity earnings from samsung corning precision glass company ltd 
samsung corning precision  a korean manufacturer of liquid crystal display glass 
both corning and samsung corning precision have recently approved expansions of manufacturing capacity in taiwan and korea  respectively 
these capital projects are expected to begin production in sales in the environmental technologies business  a manufacturer of catalytic converter substrates  increased  or million  compared to  primarily due to increased us auto production driven by financing incentives and strong growth in europe and japan 
earnings in this business improved  compared to  as a significant increase in equity earnings from cormetech  a us designer and manufacturer of industrial catalysts  was partially offset by price declines and increased manufacturing and development costs related to new products 
in october  corning announced the construction of a new diesel emission control product manufacturing facility 
the new plant is being built in erwin  ny 
construction on the project began in and is expected to be completed in sales in the life sciences business  a supplier of advanced microplates and other laboratory products  increased  or million  compared to  primarily due to strong growth in most product lines 
earnings in the business more than doubled over  primarily due to cost savings from the discontinuation of corning s investment in microarray technology products in the third quarter of  as well as improved manufacturing efficiencies and higher sales 
sales in the conventional video components business  a manufacturer of optically pure  mechanically precise face plates and funnels for larger screen television tubes  decreased  or million  compared to pricing pressure is strong in this market due to increased competition 
a significant portion of this business is concentrated with few customers  two of which have recently merged 
one significant customer has exited the business and sales demand from another key customer is uncertain 
management is considering operational and strategic alternatives should the business continue to decline 
corning recorded an impairment of the property  plant and equipment of this business  recognizing a charge of million in the fourth quarter of see restructuring  impairment and other charges for further detail 
excluding the asset impairment and restructuring charges  the loss in the business increased almost for the year  compared to  primarily due to decreased sales volume and continued competitive pricing pressures 
samsung corning company ltd 
samsung corning  a owned manufacturer of glass panels and funnels based in south korea  also experienced pricing pressure resulting in an approximate decline in equity earnings for  compared to the prior year 
sales in corning s other technologies businesses  including semiconductor materials and ophthalmic products  decreased  or million  compared to the decrease was led by the exit of the lighting business and lower sales volume of high purity fused silica products in the semiconductor materials business as capital spending in the semiconductor equipment industry remained at relatively low levels 
the businesses incurred a loss for the year compared to break even results in the losses were primarily due to significantly lower sales volume and increased spending in development and engineering for calcium fluoride products 
vs 
sales in for the technologies segment decreased  or million  compared to excluding the impact of acquisitions  sales declined 
sales increases in the life sciences business were more than offset by declines in every other business in this segment 
segment net income also declined in as the segment recorded net income of million  compared to million in  for a decrease  or million 
the decline in profitability was primarily due to restructuring charges and weaker performance by most businesses in the segment  which was partially offset by improved performance in the life sciences business 
sales in the display technology business decreased  or million  in  compared to a significant shift in customer demand from japan to korea caused volume to increase approximately at samsung corning precision and in the consolidated business 
this volume growth  when offset by the impact of price declines and the deterioration of the yen  resulted in the sales decline of 
earnings for decreased approximately  primarily due to lower operating margins driven by pricing pressures  start up costs incurred for the may opening of a new manufacturing facility in taiwan and additional development and engineering expenses for eagle tm  a new glass substrate used in active matrix liquid crystal displays 
additionally  equity earnings from samsung corning precision decreased over compared to  primarily due to corning having a smaller ownership interest in the company in versus sales in the environmental technologies business decreased  or million  in  compared to the business experienced lower sales volumes  compared to  due to decreased vehicle production 
volume growth in asia was more than offset by declining volumes in north america and europe 
earnings for the year were down almost  primarily due to lower sales volumes  manufacturing inefficiencies related to the introduction of new ultra thin wall products  excess capacity and start up costs in south africa and china 
sales in the life sciences business increased  or million  in  compared to the improvement was primarily due to an increase in sales volume 
earnings in the base business excluding microarray technology almost doubled over  primarily due to a shift to higher margin products in sales mix along with improvements in manufacturing costs and selling  general and administrative expenses 
overall earnings in the business were diluted due to the investment in microarray technology  which corning discontinued at the end of sales in the conventional video components business decreased  or million  in  compared to the decline was primarily due to a weak us economy and increased competitive pricing pressure 
earnings were down almost due to lower sales volumes  decreased margins  a production slowdown in the fourth quarter and lower equity earnings 
samsung corning also experienced lower sales volumes and increased competitive pricing pressure  and thus lower earnings 
sales in corning s other technologies businesses decreased  or million  in  compared to excluding the acquisition of tropel in march  sales decreased 
the decrease was due to softness in the market for ophthalmic products and high purity fused silica 
earnings for the year were approximately breakeven and down slightly  compared to lower sales volumes and production slowdowns were partially offset by a marginal increase in equity earnings from eurokera  a french based manufacturer of glass ceramic cooktops  which resulted in comparable earnings between years 
corning exited the lighting and tubing businesses in and shutdown manufacturing facilities in greenville  oh and corning  ny 
outlook management expects sales in the technologies segment to increase in versus due to increased desktop monitor penetration rates  continued global clean air emission requirements and a recovery in the semiconductor market 
most businesses in this segment are expected to increase sales with the display technologies business at the forefront 
thus  management anticipates sales may improve million to million over corning expects profitability in this segment to improve approximately million to million in  primarily through increased sales volume and the achievement of significant manufacturing gains 
this segment includes south korean based equity companies that generated equity earnings of million in political or economic instability in that region could adversely impact these operations and the results of this segment overall 
non segment results corning s non segment results include the operations of steuben  a crystal glass manufacturer  and equity earnings from small nonstrategic investments that are not aligned with corning s two operating segments 
in addition  the results of operating segments do not include amortization of goodwill  gain on repurchases and retirement of debt and impairment charges related to pittsburgh corning corporation 
liquidity and capital resources sources of cash flow and key activities in  corning s short and long term debt ratings were downgraded to sub investment grade 
at this sub investment grade level  corning is precluded from accessing the short term commercial paper market 
corning s access to the long term debt markets has been and will likely continue to be limited 
the terms that corning could receive on new debt issues will likely be consistent with those generally available to high yield issuers 
as an additional source of funds  corning currently has full unrestricted access to a billion revolving credit facility with banks  expiring on august  as of december   there were no borrowings under the credit facility 
the facility includes one financial covenant limiting the ratio of total debt to total capital  as defined  to not greater than 
at december  and  this ratio was 
as disclosed in restructuring  impairment and other charges  corning recorded an impairment of goodwill in the fourth quarter 
further declines in the fair value of corning s telecommunications segment could cause future impairments of goodwill  tangible or intangible assets or prompt restructuring actions 
such charges could cause a material increase to corning s debt to capital ratio 
on december   corning completed the sale of its precision lens business to m for net proceeds of million in cash 
the transaction resulted in a gain of million million after tax 
in addition  corning could receive an additional million in cash in  the majority of which is currently on deposit in escrow 
in july and august  corning issued million shares of series c mandatory convertible preferred stock having a liquidation preference of per share  plus accrued and unpaid dividends  resulting in gross proceeds of million 
the mandatory convertible stock has an annual dividend rate of  payable quarterly in cash 
the first dividend payment date was november  the dividends are also payable immediately upon conversion to corning common sock 
at the time corning issued the series c convertible preferred stock  a one time dividend was declared for all dividends that will be payable from issuance through the mandatory conversion date of august  corning secured the payment of the dividends through the issuance of a promissory note and used a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the series c preferred stock to purchase million of us treasury securities that were pledged as collateral to secure the payments on the promissory note 
as a result  net proceeds of the offering were million 
in addition  corning redeemed the remaining thousand shares of series b preferred stock for million in august 
the series c preferred stock will automatically convert on the mandatory conversion date of august   into between and shares of corning common stock  depending on the then current market price 
at any time prior to the mandatory conversion date  holders may elect to convert in whole or part of their shares of series c preferred stock into shares of common stock plus an amount of cash equal to the market value at that time of the pro rata share of the collateral portfolio that secures the promissory note 
at december   approximately million shares of the series c preferred stock had been converted into million common shares 
as the closing price of corning common stock was on july   the holder could immediately convert the series c preferred stock and obtain a value of shares valued at plus in future dividends indicating that the preferred stock contained a beneficial conversion feature of per preferred share 
the beneficial conversion totaled approximately million and was charged to the accumulated deficit in the third quarter 
the beneficial conversion was also deducted from earnings attributable to common shareholders in the earnings per share calculations 
in march  corning filed a universal shelf registration statement with the us securities and exchange commission sec that became effective in the first quarter 
the shelf permits the issuance of up to billion of various debt and equity securities 
subsequent to the issuance above and as of december   corning s remaining capacity under its shelf registration was approximately billion 
uses of cash and key activities in addition to funding operations in  corning used cash for debt repurchases  capital spending and restructuring actions 
during  corning repurchased and retired zero coupon convertible debentures with an accreted value of million in exchange for cash of million for the year ended december  corning recorded gains of million million after tax on these transactions for the year ended december  corning recorded the gain on repurchases as a component of income from continuing operations  as permitted by sfas no 
the remaining debentures may be put back to corning on november   at per debenture and on november   at per debenture 
corning has the option of settling this obligation in cash  common stock  or a combination of both 
from time to time  corning may repurchase certain additional debt securities in open market or privately negotiated transactions 
through february   corning spent an additional million to repurchase and retire more zero coupon convertible debentures and expects to record a pre tax gain of approximately million in the first quarter of corning also spent million to retire its commercial paper borrowings during corning had no commercial paper borrowings as of december   nor does it anticipate issuing commercial paper in the foreseeable future 
in total  corning spent million in to pay down short and long term debt 
corning reduced its capital spending dramatically in  which reflected the downturn in telecommunications and was part of a comprehensive effort to conserve cash 
capital spending totaled billion  billion and billion in  and  respectively 
the high level of capital spending in and related primarily to capacity expansions in corning s telecommunications segment and expanded research and development facilities 
corning s capital spending program is expected to be limited to million to million 
capital spending activity in is primarily expected to be the planned expansion in the liquid crystal display and environmental businesses 
during  corning made payments of million related to employee severance and termination costs and million in other exit costs resulting from restructuring actions 
corning expects additional payments for actions taken in and to approximate million in in february  corning announced it will exit its optical switching product line and incur cash charges of million to million 
in the third quarter of  corning repurchased million shares of its common stock in a privately negotiated transaction for million 
key balance sheet data at december   cash and short term investments totaled billion  compared with billion at december  the decrease from december  was primarily due to short and long term debt repayments  restructuring payments and the use of working capital 
these items were partially offset by significantly lower capital spending  the sale of the precision lens business and proceeds from the issuance of series c mandatory convertible preferred stock 
balance sheet and working capital measures are provided in the following table dollars in millions as of december  working capital   working capital  excluding cash and short term investments current assets to current liabilities trade accounts receivable  net of allowances days sales outstanding inventories inventory turns days payable outstanding long term debt   total debt to total capital days sales outstanding are calculated on the fourth quarter of each respective year 
the increase in working capital  excluding cash and short term investments  reflected lower short term borrowings and accounts payable and the recognition of an income tax receivable compared to december  the increase in the current ratio was primarily due to the elimination of commercial paper borrowings 
trade accounts receivable and inventories decreased largely due to significantly lower sales and sales volumes compared to in  tax legislation was enacted in the us that extended the net operating loss carryback period from two to five years 
due to this legislation change  corning will be able to carryback the anticipated us federal net operating loss and claim a refund which would not have otherwise been available 
other accounts receivable at december   included a receivable of million as a result of corning availing itself of this opportunity 
corning expects to receive this refund in the second quarter of credit ratings corning s credit ratings as of february  were as follows rating agency rating rating last update long term debt commercial paper standard poor s bb b july  moody s ba not prime july  fitch bb b july  note all three rating agencies maintain a negative outlook 
in july  all three rating agencies announced a downgrade which is reflected in the ratings above 
should business performance decline further from the levels experienced in  these ratings could receive further review for possible downgrade 
although the sub investment grade ratings preclude corning s access to the commercial paper market  corning s overall financial flexibility remains adequate as a result of its cash position  short term investments and committed revolving credit facilities 
corning s debt agreements do not include covenants that accelerate the maturity of borrowings as a result of changes in credit ratings 
if business performance should decline further from levels seen in the fourth quarter of  corning s ability to enter into foreign exchange contracts with a duration of greater than one year could be adversely impacted 
such limitation would not significantly impact the company s current hedging program 
in addition  the sub investment grade credit rating has  in some instances  resulted in requirements to deposit cash with counterparties under performance surety bond and letter of credit arrangements 
at december   million of restricted cash was included in other long term assets 
a security rating is not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization 
each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 
management assessment of liquidity corning s earnings were not adequate to cover its fixed charges principally interest and related charges on debt  primarily as a result of losses incurred in corning s telecommunication s segment 
corning s earnings will likely not be sufficient to cover its fixed charges in corning s major source of funds in will be its cash and short term investments 
management believes corning has ample liquidity to meet its funding needs for and beyond  which includes funding operations  restructuring payments  research and development and capital expenditures 
obligations at december   the contractual obligations of corning were as follows and thereafter total in millions long term debt    minimum rental commitments total contractual cash obligations    off balance sheet arrangements amount of commitment and contingency expiration per period less than to to to years and in millions total year years years years thereafter performance bonds and guarantees contingent purchase price for acquisitions dow corning credit facility stand by letters of credit loan guarantees total other commercial commitments and contingencies at december   corning had guaranteed debt of equity affiliates which totaled million 
in addition  corning and certain of its subsidiaries have provided other financial guarantees and contingent liabilities in the form of purchase price adjustments related to attainment of milestones  stand by letters of credit and performance bonds  some of which do not have fixed or scheduled expiration dates 
corning has agreed to provide a credit facility related to dow corning corporation as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the funding of the dow corning credit facility is subject to events connected to the bankruptcy plan as described in note management believes the significant majority of these guarantees and contingent liabilities will expire without being funded 
corning has leased equipment from three unconsolidated special purpose entities spe for which the sole purpose is the leasing of equipment to corning 
these spes are not consolidated in the financial statements since the equity investor of the spe has made a substantial investment that is at risk for the life of the spe 
however  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation  consolidation of variable interest entities in january interpretation will require the consolidation of variable interest entities vie by the primary beneficiary 
management is still assessing the impacts of this interpretation  however  it is reasonably possible that corning will be considered the primary beneficiary of the three vies  and therefore will consolidate these entities beginning on july  as of december   the total assets in unconsolidated vies were million 
in addition  corning s maximum loss exposure as a result of its involvement with these vies is million 
this amount represents payments that would be due to the vie in the event of a total loss of the equipment 
corning carries insurance coverage for this risk 
pensions corning has a number of defined benefit pension plans covering certain domestic and international employees 
its largest single pension plan is corning s us qualified plan 
at december   this plan accounted for of corning s consolidated defined benefit pension plans projected benefit obligation and of the related plans assets 
in  global capital market developments resulted in negative returns on this plan s assets and a decline in the discount rate used to estimate the related pension liability 
as a result  at december   this us plan s accumulated benefit obligation abo exceeded the fair value of its assets  which required corning to record an additional minimum pension liability in accordance with sfas no 
 employer s accounting for pensions 
the effect of this non cash adjustment was to increase pension liabilities by million  increase intangible assets by million and increase other comprehensive loss by million million after tax 
corning has traditionally contributed to this qualified us pension plan on an annual basis 
over the last ten years  voluntary contributions averaged million a year 
corning has historically contributed in excess of the irs minimum requirements  and as a result  mandatory contributions are not expected to be required for this us plan until in the fourth quarter of  corning made voluntary pension contributions to this us plan of million  resulting in total contributions for the year of million 
corning expects to increase the level of voluntary contributions to this us plan over the next few years 
for  corning anticipates making voluntary contributions totaling million to this plan 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein 
the estimates that required management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments are described below 
impairment of goodwill in the telecommunications reporting unit sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires management to make judgments about the fair value of its reporting unit 
corning measures fair value on the basis of discounted expected future cash flows 
the determination of expected future cash flows involves judgment 
corning s judgment was based upon our historical experience in the telecommunications business  our current knowledge from our commercial relationships  and available external information about future trends 
with this input  it is management s expectation that there will be minimal volume growth in the short term  volume growth is assumed to accelerate beginning in commensurate with overall market recovery 
terminal value of the business assumes a growth in perpetuity of 
these cash flows are also used to value intangible and tangible assets which determine the implied value of reporting unit goodwill 
the discount rate applied to these cash flows represents a telecommunications weighted average cost of capital based upon current debt and equity activity of public companies representing a cross section of worldwide competitors of the reporting unit 
corning used a discount rate of in its calculation of fair value of the expected future cash flows and recorded an impairment charge of million 
had corning used a discount rate of  the fair value of the reporting unit would have exceeded its carrying value and there would not have been an impairment 
had corning used a discount rate of  the pre tax impairment charge would have been approximately million higher 
impairment of assets held for use sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  requires management to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets when an event of impairment has occurred 
management must exercise judgment in assessing whether an event of impairment has occurred 
corning concluded events of impairment had occurred in two of its businesses in the fourth quarter of and the company recorded pre tax charges totaling million 
in each circumstance  behavior of external parties  including customers and competitors  were considered in the determination that an assessment for impairment was required 
management must also exercise judgment in the determination of expected future cash flows against which to compare the carrying value of the asset group being evaluated 
in both measurements  the carrying value far exceeded the expected cash flows 
management then exercised judgment in determining the fair value of the assets from which the impairment charge was measured 
for its photonic technologies business  management based the fair value of its long lived assets on the actual results of recent asset auctions of similar equipment 
for the conventional television business  management exercised judgment about alternative volume and sales price scenarios  computed discounted cash flows and assigned its best estimate of probability to each alternative 
management has reduced the useful lives of the fixed assets of this business as a result of this assessment 
restructuring charges and impairments resulting from restructuring actions during and  corning recorded write downs of property  plant and equipment as a result of decisions to exit facilities  primarily in the telecommunications segment 
assets impaired were primarily equipment  construction in progress and buildings 
some of the equipment is to be sold and some abandoned 
corning used information available from recent auctions of telecommunications equipment to estimate salvage value when measuring impairment 
the estimated salvage values are very low  primarily due to the currently depressed market for telecommunications related equipment 
the salvage values of property impaired were also estimated to be minimal as certain facilities will be abandoned and not sold 
it is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to reserves 
valuation allowances for deferred income taxes sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires management to exercise judgment about its future results in assessing the realizability of its deferred tax assets 
at december   corning had gross deferred tax assets of billion 
corning determined that the likelihood of realization of certain deferred tax assets is less than and recorded valuation allowances of million 
if future taxable income differs from management s estimate  adjustments to these allowances will be required and will impact future net income 
probability of litigation outcomes sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  requires management to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain 
in making its determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters  management considers the evaluation of outside counsel knowledgeable about each matter  as well as known outcomes in case law 
see item  legal proceedings for a detailed discussion of the key litigation matters the company faces 
the most significant matter involving management s most complex judgment is that of pittsburgh corning corporation 
there are a number of factors bearing upon the company s potential liability  including the inherent complexity of a chapter filing  the company s history of success in defending itself against asbestos claims  the company s assessment of the strength of its corporate veil defenses  the company s continuing dialogue with its insurance carriers and the claimant s representatives  and other factors 
the company s conclusion  subject to change as future events unfold  is that there is no guarantee that a global settlement can or will be reached  and that it is more likely than not that the company will continue to litigate 
pension assumptions in  management made a change in assumption that will impact pension expense in future periods 
specifically  management has lowered its expected long term rate of return on pension assets from to 
management has not altered the nature of the pension trust investments 
recent asset performance has been below the assumption 
as such  it is lowering its long term rate of return assumption 
this will increase corning s pension expense as measured in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pension  compared to amounts recorded in the increase will approximate million in in process research and development corning completed a number of purchase acquisitions in as part of analyzing each of these acquisitions  corning made a decision to buy technology that had not yet been commercialized rather than develop the technology internally 
corning based this decision on a number of factors  including the amount of time it would take to bring the technology to market 
corning also considered its internal research resource allocation and its progress on comparable technology  if any 
corning expects to use the same decision process in the future 
in connection with the acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method  management is responsible for estimating the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired 
management has made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses resulting from such acquisitions 
amounts allocated to purchased iprd were established through recognized valuation techniques in the high technology communications industry 
certain projects were acquired for which technological feasibility had not been established at the date of acquisition and for which no alternative future uses existed 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for research and development costs  as interpreted by fasb interpretation no 
 applicability of fasb statement no 
to business combinations accounted for by the purchase method  amounts assigned to iprd meeting the above criteria must be charged to expense at the date of consummation of the purchase 
the value allocated to projects for which a charge was recorded was determined by the traditional income approach  which discounts expected future debt free income to present value 
the discount rates used were specific to each project and were derived from a cost of capital for each specific acquisition target  adjusted upward for the stage of completion of each project 
expected future debt free income was derived with the following considerations 
revenues were estimated based on relevant market size  growth trends in the industry and individual product sales cycles  
estimated operating expenses included cost of goods sold  selling  general and administrative expenses  and research and development expenses to maintain the products once they have been introduced  
estimated tax expenses were specific to each acquired entity and its tax profile  and 
for certain projects  as appropriate  a return on core technology was deducted based upon market standards for licensed existing technology and a return on assets was deducted based upon industry comparisons 
the nature of the efforts to develop the acquired technology into commercially viable products consists principally of planning  designing and testing activities necessary to determine that the product can meet market expectations 
corning expected that products incorporating the acquired technology from these projects will be completed and will begin to generate cash flows over the five years following integration 
the timing and success of development of the technologies not abandoned remains a risk due to the remaining effort to achieve technical viability  rapidly changing customer markets  uncertain standards for new products and significant competition in the marketplace 
the following is a more detailed discussion of the valuations associated with acquisitions for which such charges have been recorded acquisition of pirelli s optical components and devices business on december   corning completed the pirelli transaction 
this business had a significant number of research and development projects ongoing at the time of acquisition of which were valued as iprd projects 
projected debt free income was initially discounted using a rate of to reflect the weighted average cost of capital entity risk for this entity 
each product was also discounted to account for the research project s stage of development 
corning recorded a non tax deductible iprd charge of million in the fourth quarter of costs to complete the in process research programs were originally estimated to approximate million to million at the valuation date 
these projects have been categorized into four product technologies as follows lithium niobate modulators the business is developing a number of different lithium niobate modulators 
lithium niobate modulators are ideally suited for use in high speed  long haul optical communications networks 
the technology has been chosen by a majority of long haul equipment suppliers because it has the best combination of optical  electronic and reliability performance 
five of the research projects qualified as iprd projects and the completion percentages of these five projects ranged from to 
a non tax deductible charge of million was recognized and the value of individual modulator projects in process ranged from million to million 
corning plans to continue research on lithium niobate modulators 
however  due to the downturn in the telecommunications industry future revenues expected from these projects will be significantly less than originally estimated 
submarine products the business had planned to develop high reliability nanometer nm pump laser chips and modules for submarine use 
these devices are components within an optical amplifier 
at the acquisition date  two iprd projects with completion percentages of and were valued 
a non tax deductible charge of million resulted from nm pump laser submarine projects in process 
individual research values were million and million 
as part of the downsizing of the photonic technologies business announced on july   corning abandoned this project 
this action did not have a material impact on cash flow  or the results of operations 
gratings at the date of acquisition  three qualifying gratings programs with completion percentages ranging from to were valued 
a non tax deductible iprd charge of million resulted from gratings programs 
individual in process projects were valued between million and million 
as part of the downsizing of the photonic technologies business announced on july   corning abandoned this project 
this action did not have a material impact on cash flow  or the results of operations 
specialty fiber two specialty fiber programs at the business met the definition of iprd 
specialty fibers are used in conjunction with several other components to make an erbium doped fiber amplifier  which boosts the strength of the optical signal 
at the acquisition date  these projects were and complete 
a non tax deductible iprd charge of million resulted from specialty fiber programs  with the largest program being valued at million 
corning plans to continue research in specialty fiber 
intellisense on june   corning completed the acquisition of the remaining shares of intellisense  a manufacturer and developer of micro electro mechanical systems mems  or small electro mechanical  micro fabricated devices 
mems technology  when integrated with optics and packaging expertise  enables the development of optical add drop switches and optical cross connects  that are expected to play a key role in the development and buildout of the optical networking layer 
as of the acquisition date  intellisense had three qualifying research projects underway 
these research and development projects are anticipated to result primarily in the development of new telecommunications products 
projected debt free income was initially discounted using a rate of to reflect the weighted average cost of capital entity risk for intellisense 
each product was also discounted to account for the research project s stage of development 
the completion percentages ranged from to 
at the acquisition date  the projected costs to complete the iprd programs approximated million 
corning recorded a million iprd charge in the second quarter of no project valued exceeded million 
failure of any single project would not materially impact corning s financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
as of december   one of the projects has been canceled  the other two projects are continuing with one at a reduced level 
as a result  the future revenues expected from these projects will be significantly less than originally estimated 
nz applied technologies on may   corning completed the acquisition of nz applied technologies nzat 
nzat was developing a line of high speed  solid state components for dense wavelength division multiplexing systems  such as variable optical attenuators  that will meet industry demands for speed and quality 
of these projects  four were determined to meet the criteria for purchased iprd as of the acquisition date 
projected debt free income was initially discounted using a rate of to reflect the weighted average cost of capital entity risk for nzat 
each product was also discounted to account for the research project s stage of development 
the completion percentages ranged from to 
at the acquisition date  the projected costs to complete the iprd programs approximated million 
a million non tax deductible iprd charge was recognized and the value of individual projects ranged from million to million 
in the third quarter of  due to the significant downturn in demand for telecommunication products  corning decided to suspend the research related to these projects 
when the demand for corning s telecommunication products rebound  management will reevaluate the market at that time and a decision will be made as to whether research and development on these projects should resume 
photonics technology research center on february   corning acquired the photonics technology research center ptrc 
located in suffolk  uk  the ptrc had extensive research and development efforts underway at the acquisition date including work on planar integrated optics  semiconductor optical amplifiers  electro absorption modulators and optical networking devices 
seven projects were determined to meet the criteria for purchased iprd 
projected debt free income was determined for each of the projects and initially discounted using a rate of to reflect the weighted average cost of capital entity risk for ptrc 
each product was also discounted to account for the research project s stage of development 
the completion percentages ranged from to 
at the acquisition date  the projected costs to complete the iprd programs approximated million 
a million million after tax iprd charge was recognized and the value of individual projects ranged from less than million to million 
in the fourth quarter of  due to the significant downturn in demand for telecommunication products  corning announced it would close this facility and abandon most of the projects 
research will continue related to semiconductor optical amplifiers and electro absorption modulators at other research facilities 
as a result  the future revenues expected from these projects will be significantly less than originally estimated 
environment corning has been named by the environmental protection agency under the superfund act  or by state governments under similar state laws  as a potentially responsible party for active hazardous waste sites 
under the superfund act  all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste site  identified by such agency  are jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup unless the agency agrees otherwise 
it is corning s policy to accrue for its estimated liability related to superfund sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned and operated by corning based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants 
corning has accrued approximately million for its estimated liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation at december  based upon the information developed to date  management believes that the accrued amount is a reasonable estimate of corning s estimated liability and that the risk of an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote 
new accounting standards in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
among other provisions  all future business combinations will be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and the use of the pooling of interests method is prohibited for transactions initiated after june  in addition  goodwill will no longer be amortized but will be subject to impairment tests at least annually 
sfas no 
was effective for corning on january  an assessment of the recoverability of goodwill recorded on the date of adoption was completed in the first quarter indicating that the carrying value of goodwill was recoverable 
at december   goodwill approximated billion 
corning recorded a million million after tax charge for impairment of a portion of the goodwill in its telecommunications segment after completing its annual assessment in the fourth quarter 
see impairment of goodwill for further discussion of the charge recorded 
the following table presents a reconciliation of reported net loss income and loss earnings per share to adjusted net loss income and loss earnings per share  as if sfas no

 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this standard addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
corning was required to implement sfas no 
on january  corning does not expect this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this standard supercedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the standard retains the previously existing accounting requirements related to the recognition and measurement of the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used while expanding the measurement requirements of long lived assets to be disposed of by sale to include discontinued operations 
it also expands on the previously existing reporting requirements for discontinued operations to include a component of an entity that either has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale 
corning adopted sfas no 
on january  corning has followed this standard to measure impairments of long lived assets through and report business divestitures 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 which rescinds sfas no 
 reporting gains and losses from extinguishment of debt  sfas no 
 accounting for intangible assets of motor carriers and sfas no 
 extinguishments of debt made to satisfy sinking fund requirements and amends sfas no 
 accounting for leases 
this statement updates  clarifies and simplifies existing accounting pronouncements 
as a result of rescinding sfas no 
and sfas no 
 the criteria in accounting principles bulletin apb no 
will be used to classify gains and losses from extinguishment of debt 
corning adopted the reporting guidance of sfas no 
in the second quarter of in its accounting for repurchases and retirement of debt 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the remaining provisions of sfas no 
will be adopted by corning in fiscal year corning does not expect the adoption of the remaining provisions to have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this standard nullifies emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
this standard requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred rather than the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
corning is required to implement sfas no 
on january  corning does not expect this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  which expands previously issued accounting guidance and disclosure requirements for certain guarantees 
the interpretation requires an entity to recognize an initial liability for the fair value of an obligation assumed by issuing a guarantee 
the provision for initial recognition and measurement of the liability will be applied on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  corning does not expect this interpretation to have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
 which provides optional transition guidance for those companies electing to voluntarily adopt the accounting provisions of sfas no 
in addition  the statement mandates certain interim disclosures that are incremental to those required by sfas no 
corning will continue to account for stock based compensation in accordance with apb no 
as such  corning does not expect this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations 
corning has adopted the disclosure only provisions of sfas no 
at december  in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
 which requires all vies to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary 
the primary beneficiary is the entity that holds the majority of the beneficial interests in the vie 
in addition  the interpretation expands disclosure requirements for both vies that are consolidated as well as vies from which the entity is the holder of a significant amount of the beneficial interests  but not the majority 
the disclosure requirements of this interpretation are effective for all financial statements issued after january  the consolidation requirements of this interpretation are effective for all periods beginning after june  management is still assessing the impacts of this interpretation  however  it is reasonably possible that corning will be considered the primary beneficiary of three existing spes and therefore would need to consolidate these entities beginning on july  the assets and debt of these entities at december   approximates million 
forward looking statements the statements in this annual report  in reports subsequently filed by corning with the sec on forms q and k  and related comments by management which are not historical facts or information and contain words such as believes  expects  anticipates  estimates  forecasts  and similar expressions are forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause the actual outcome to be materially different 
such risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to global economic and political conditions  currency fluctuations  product demand and industry capacity  competitive products and pricing  sufficiency of manufacturing capacity and efficiencies  cost reductions  availability and costs of critical materials  new product development and commercialization  attracting and retaining key personnel  order activity and demand from major customers  fluctuations in capital spending by customers in the telecommunications industry and other business segments  financial condition of customers  changes in the mix of sales between premium and non premium products  facility expansions and new plant start up costs  adverse litigation or regulatory developments  including future or pending tax legislation  adequacy and availability of insurance  capital resource and cash flow activities  capital spending  equity company activities  interest costs  acquisition and divestiture activity  the rate of technology change  the ability to enforce patents  product performance issues  stock price fluctuations  and other risks detailed in corning s sec filings 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s corning operates and conducts business in many foreign countries and as a result is exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
corning s exposure to exchange rate effects includes 
exchange rate movements on financial instruments and transactions denominated in foreign currencies which impact earnings  and 
exchange rate movements upon conversion of net assets in foreign subsidiaries for which the functional currency is not the us dollar  which impact corning s net equity 
corning s most significant foreign currency exposures relate to japan  korea  taiwan and western european countries 
corning selectively enters into foreign exchange forward and option contracts with durations generally months or less to hedge its exposure to exchange rate risk on foreign source income and purchases 
the hedges are scheduled to mature coincident with the timing of the underlying foreign currency commitments and transactions 
the objective of these contracts is to neutralize the impact of exchange rate movements on corning s operating results 
corning also enters into foreign exchange forward contracts when situations arise where its foreign subsidiaries or corning incorporated enter into lending situations  generally on an intercompany basis  denominated in currencies other than their local currency 
corning holds a derivative contract that hedges certain foreign currency denominated net asset exposures 
corning does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
equity in earnings of associated companies has historically represented a significant amount of corning s loss income from continuing operations 
equity in earnings of associated companies net of impairments was million in with foreign based affiliates comprising over of this amount due to the impairments recorded in equity income 
samsung corning and samsung corning precision glass totaled million in equity earnings for exchange rate fluctuations and actions taken by management of these entities to reduce this risk can affect the earnings of these companies 
corning uses a sensitivity analysis to assess the market risk associated with its foreign currency exchange risk 
market risk is defined as the potential change in fair value of assets and liabilities resulting from an adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates 
at december   corning and its consolidated subsidiaries had open forward contracts  open option contracts  foreign denominated debt and foreign cash and cash equivalent holdings with values exposed to exchange rate movements  all of which were designated as hedges at december  a adverse movement in quoted foreign currency exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of million 
the nature of corning s foreign exchange rate risk exposures has not changed materially from december  interest rate risk management in march and april of  corning entered into interest rate swaps that are fair value hedges and economically exchanged million of fixed rate long term debt to floating rate debt 
under the terms of the swap agreements  corning will pay the counterparty a floating rate that is indexed to the six month libor rate and receive the fixed rates of to  which are the stated interest rates on the long term debt instruments 
as a result of these transactions  corning is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes 
the interest rate on these instruments is reset every six months and they expire in to years 
it is corning s policy to conservatively manage its exposure to changes in interest rates 
corning s policy is that total floating and variable rate debt will not exceed of the total debt portfolio at anytime 
at december   corning s consolidated debt portfolio contained approximately of variable rate instruments
