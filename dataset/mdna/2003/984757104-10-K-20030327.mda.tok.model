item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to inventories  restructuring costs  bad debts  intangible assets  income taxes  debt service and contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about operating results and the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  involve its more significant estimates and judgments and are therefore particularly important to an understanding of our results of operations and financial position 
revenue receivables as described in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements  we sell our products both directly to retail customers and through wholesale channels 
revenue from the sale of merchandise to retail customers is recognized at the time of sale  while revenue from wholesale customers is recognized when shipped 
we believe that this is the time that persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
revenue is recognized net of any applicable discounts and allowances 
customers  be they retail or wholesale  do have the right to return product to us in certain limited situations 
such rights of return have not precluded revenue recognition because we have a long history with such returns  which we use in constructing a reserve 
this reserve  however  is subject to change 
in addition to returns  we bear credit risk relative to our wholesale customers 
we have provided a reserve for bad debts in our financial statements based on our estimates of the creditworthiness of our customers 
however  this reserve is also subject to change 
changes in these reserves could affect our operating results and cash flows 
inventory we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value  based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
in addition  our inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market on a last in first out lifo basis 
fluctuations in inventory levels along with the cost of raw materials could impact the carrying value of our inventory 
changes in the carrying value of inventory could affect our operating results and cash flow 
taxes we have a significant deferred tax asset recorded on our financial statements 
this asset arose at the time of our recapitalization in and is a future tax deduction for us 
the recoverability of this future tax deduction is dependent upon our future profitability 
we have made an assessment that this asset is likely to be recovered and is appropriately reflected on the balance sheet 
should we find that we are not able to utilize this deduction in the future  we would have to record a reserve for all or a part of this asset  which would adversely affect our operating results and cash flows 
restructuring reserve in fiscal  we closed our distribution facility in utah  recorded a restructuring charge and established a reserve for future expenses related to the restructuring 
part of the restructuring charge related to the lease commitment that we have through in connection with the restructuring  we did not record the entire lease commitment as a liability because we believed we would be able to sublet the facility 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we were successful in subletting the facility for the remaining lease term 
if the facility were to be vacated by the current tenant in breach of its sublease  this would negatively affect our results of operations and cash flows 
value of long lived assets  including intangibles long lived assets on our balance sheet consist primarily of property  plant and equipment  classic vehicles and trademarks 
we periodically review the carrying value of all of these assets based  in part  upon current estimated market values  and our projections of anticipated future cash flows 
we undertake this review when facts and circumstances suggest that cash flows emanating from those assets may be diminished 
any impairment charge that we record reduces our earnings 
while we believe that our future estimates are reasonable  different assumptions regarding items such as future cash flows and the volatility inherent in markets which we serve could affect our evaluations and result in impairment charges against the carrying value of those assets 
performance measures we measure the performance of our retail and wholesale segments through a segment margin calculation  which specifically identifies not only gross profit on the sales of products through the two channels but also costs and expenses specifically related to each segment 
fluctuations in quarterly operating results we have experienced  and may experience in the future  fluctuations in our quarterly operating results 
there are numerous factors that can contribute to these fluctuations  however  the principal factors are seasonality and new store openings 
seasonality 
we have historically realized higher revenues and operating income in our fourth quarter  particularly in our retail business 
we believe that this has been due primarily to the increase in the number of our retail stores and to increased sales in the giftware industry during the holiday season of the fourth quarter 
new store openings 
the timing of our new store openings may also have an impact on our quarterly results 
first  we incur certain one time expenses related to opening each new store 
these expenses  which consist primarily of salaries  supplies and marketing costs  are expensed as incurred 
second  most store expenses vary proportionately with sales  but there is a fixed cost component 
this typically results in lower store profitability when a new store opens because new stores generally have lower sales than mature stores 
due to both of these factors  during periods when new store openings as a percentage of the base are higher  operating profit may decline in dollars and or as a percentage of sales 
as the overall store base matures  the fixed cost component of selling expenses is spread over an increased level of sales  resulting in a decrease in selling and other expenses as a percentage of sales 
fifty two weeks ended december  compared to fifty two weeks ended december  sales sales increased to million in from million in wholesale sales  including european operations  increased to million in from million for this growth was achieved primarily by increasing the number of wholesale locations and also by increasing sales to existing customers 
retail sales increased to million in from million for there were retail stores open as of december  compared to stores open at december  the increase in retail sales was achieved primarily through two factors  the addition of new stores in and increased sales in the stores opened in which in were open for less than a full year  and  to a lesser extent  through increased sales in catalog and internet operations  partially offset by a decrease in comparable store sales 
comparable store and catalog and internet sales in decreased compared to retail comparable store sales in decreased compared to the primary factors which drove the decrease in comparable store sales were a decline in store traffic  and mall traffic generally  and our decision not to repeat certain promotional activities undertaken in there were stores included in the comparable store base at the end of  and of these stores were included for less than a full year 
gross profit gross profit increased to million in from million in as a percentage of sales  gross profit increased to in from in the increase in gross profit dollars in compared to was primarily attributable to the increase in sales and more efficient supply chain operations 
the improvement in gross profit rate in compared to was primarily the result of improved productivity in supply chain operations  supply chain inefficiencies in early that were not experienced in and our decision not to engage in deep discounting activities 
selling expenses selling expenses increased to million in from million in these expenses are related to both wholesale and retail operations and consist of payroll  occupancy  advertising and other operating costs  as well as preopening costs  which are expensed as incurred 
as a percentage of sales  selling expenses were in and in the increase in selling expenses in dollars and as a percentage of sales was primarily related to the continued growth in the number of retail stores  from as of december  to as of december   the effect of which is an increase in the weighting of immature stores 
immature stores are generally stores that are less than four years old 
immature stores typically generate higher selling expenses as a percentage of sales than stores that have been open for more than four years since fixed costs  as a percent of sales  are higher during the early sales maturation period 
excluding the sales and selling expenses of our most immature stores  the and store classes  selling expenses as a percentage of sales were for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the increase in selling expense as a percentage of sales for is also explained by the decrease in retail comparable store sales since the fixed components of labor and occupancy do not decrease with negative comparable store sales 
segment profitability segment profitability is sales less cost of goods sold and selling expenses 
segment profitability for our wholesale operations  including europe  was million or of wholesale sales in compared to million or of wholesale sales in segment profitability for our retail operations was million or of retail sales in compared to million or of retail sales in the increase in wholesale segment profitability was primarily attributable to increased wholesale sales and improved productivity in supply chain operations 
the increase in retail segment profitability in dollars was primarily attributable to increased retail sales and improved supply chain operations 
the decrease in retail segment profitability as a percentage of retail sales was primarily attributable to a decline in retail comparable store sales and a decline in operating profit in catalog and internet operations  partially offset by improved productivity in supply chain operations 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses  which consist primarily of personnel related costs  increased to million in from million in as a percentage of sales  general and administrative expenses decreased to from 
the increase in general and administrative expenses in dollars was primarily attributable to headcount additions in the latter part of and in  higher bonus program accruals for fiscal as compared to and occupancy expenses associated with our new headquarters opened in may ie we incurred months of such expenses in compared to approximately eight months in 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales for fiscal was primarily attributable to our ability to leverage these expenses over a larger sales base and our continued focus on expense control 
restructuring charge restructuring activities had no impact on our results of operations for in  however  we recorded an million restructuring charge associated with our decision to consolidate and restructure our distribution and manufacturing operations 
we closed our utah distribution facility and restructured our distribution and manufacturing work force during included in the restructuring charge are severance and other employee related costs  the non cash write down of non recoverable leasehold improvements  fixture and equipment investments and estimated continuing occupancy expenses for abandoned facilities  net of anticipated sub lease income 
an analysis of the activity within the restructuring reserve since december  is as follows costs paid during costs paid during the fifty two the fifty two weeks ended accrued as of weeks ended accrued as of expense december  december  december  december  occupancy    employee related   other total      during the second quarter of fiscal  we were successful in subletting the facility covered under the occupancy heading for the remaining lease term 
we believe that the remaining reserve at december  appropriately reflects our lease commitment exposure 
net other expense net other expense was million in compared to million in the primary component of this expense was interest expense  which was million in compared to million in the decrease in interest expense was the result of the reduction in total debt outstanding from million at december  to million at december   and a reduction in borrowing rates resulting from decreases in the federal funds and eurodollar rates 
income taxes the income tax provision for was million compared to million for the tax provision reflects an effective tax rate of 
the tax provision reflects an effective tax rate of 
we are currently providing a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset for our international operations 
as a result  it is anticipated that our effective tax rate for will be approximately 
we re evaluate our effective tax rate on a quarterly basis 
net income net income increased to million in from million in in  we incurred an million pre tax restructuring charge which reduced net income by million 
prior to such charge  net income increased from million to million in fifty two weeks ended december  compared to fifty two weeks ended december  sales sales increased to million in from million in this growth was primarily achieved by increasing the number of retail stores from to  increasing sales through catalog and internet operations and increasing sales to wholesale customers 
wholesale sales  including european operations  increased to million in from million for this growth was achieved both by increasing sales to existing customers and by increasing the number of wholesale locations 
retail sales increased to million in from million for there were retail stores open as of december  compared to stores open at december  the increase in retail sales was achieved primarily through the addition of new stores and increased sales in catalog and internet operations 
comparable store and catalog and internet sales in increased compared to retail comparable store sales in decreased compared to there were stores net income increased to million in from million in excluding the million restructuring charge  net of the associated tax benefit of million  net income increased to million in from million in included in the comparable store base at the end of  and of these stores were included for less than a full year 
the events of september th had significant negative effects on both our wholesale and retail divisions in in wholesale we had achieved low double digit year to date growth in incoming order volume as of the week preceding september th 
incoming order volume for the weeks subsequent to september th grew over the comparable prior year period 
in retail  with mall traffic down significantly after september th  comparable store and catalog and internet sales declined  on a year to date basis  from through august of to as of the end of the year 
gross profit gross profit increased to million in from million in as a percentage of sales  gross profit decreased to in from in the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of sales for was primarily attributable to discounts associated with the sell through of holiday merchandise in the retail business during the first quarter of  a higher mix of sales associated with our fragrance of the month sales program and a higher mix of non manufactured sales 
the gross profit rate in each of the third and fourth quarters of was higher than the comparable prior year quarter  and for the last half of increased to from in the last half of the improvement in the gross profit rate in the last half of compared to the last half of was primarily the result of supply chain inefficiencies in the fourth quarter of that were not experienced in the latter half of the supply chain inefficiencies in the fourth quarter of were related to significant over staffing in our manufacturing and logistics operations 
these supply chain inefficiencies were corrected in the first quarter of through the closure of our salt lake city distribution center and the reduction of our workforce by approximately people 
selling expenses selling expenses increased to million in from million in these expenses are related to both wholesale and retail operations and consist of payroll  occupancy  advertising and other operating costs  as well as preopening costs  which are expensed as incurred 
as a percentage of sales  selling expenses were in and in the primary factor behind the increase in selling expenses in dollars and as a percentage of sales was the increase in the number of retail stores we operated and the resulting shift in business mix between retail and wholesale sales 
retail sales  which have higher selling expenses as a percentage of sales than wholesale sales  represented of total sales in compared to in the number of retail stores increased from in to in the increase in selling expenses as a percentage of sales is also explained by the heavy weighting of new stores 
we opened new stores in and new stores typically generate lower operating margin contributions than stores that have been open for more than one year since fixed costs  as a percentage of sales  are higher during the early sales maturation period and since preopening costs are fully expensed in the year of opening 
excluding the sales and selling expenses of the and store classes from the fifty two weeks ended december   and the sales and selling expenses of the store class from the fifty two weeks ended december   store selling expense declined as a percentage of sales 
segment profitability segment profitability is sales less cost of goods sold and selling expenses 
segment profitability for our wholesale operations  including europe  was million  or of wholesale sales in compared to million or of wholesale sales in segment profitability for our retail operations was million or of retail sales in compared to million or of retail sales in the decrease in segment profitability as a percentage of sales for was primarily attributable to discounts associated with the sell through of holiday merchandise in the retail business during the first quarter of  a higher mix of sales associated with our fragrance of the month sales program and a higher mix of non manufactured sales 
segment profitability for the last half of increased to from in the last half of the improvement in segment profitability in the last half of compared to the last half of was primarily the result of supply chain inefficiencies in the fourth quarter of that were not experienced in the fourth quarter of general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses  which consist primarily of personnel related costs incurred in support functions  increased to million in from million in as a percentage of sales  general and administrative expenses increased to from 
the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the new systems infrastructure installed in the last half of fiscal  occupancy expenses associated with our new headquarters building opened in may and expenses associated with the bonus program 
restructuring charge a restructuring charge for million was recorded in fiscal to record costs associated with our decision to consolidate and restructure our distribution and manufacturing operations 
we closed our utah distribution facility and restructured our distribution and manufacturing work force during included in the restructuring charge are severance and other employee related costs  the non cash write down of non recoverable leasehold improvements  fixture and equipment investments and estimated continuing occupancy expenses for abandoned facilities  net of anticipated sub lease income 
as a result of the consolidation and restructuring  we terminated approximately manufacturing and logistics employees in february an analysis of the restructuring reserve at december  is as follows costs paid during the fifty two weeks ended accrued as of expense december  december  occupancy   employee related   other total    in addition  as described above  we recorded a million pre tax write down of non recoverable leasehold improvements  fixture and equipment investments at our utah facility 
the closure of our utah distribution facility and the restructuring of our distribution and manufacturing workforce in the first quarter of did not negatively impact our ability to execute our growth strategy in in april  we opened a new  square foot distribution center in south deerfield  massachusetts and consolidated substantially all distribution operations in this facility 
net other expense net other expense was million in compared to million in the primary component of this expense was interest expense  which was million in compared to million in the decrease in interest expense was the result of the reduction in total debt outstanding from million at december  to million at december   and a reduction in borrowing rates resulting from decreases in the federal funds and eurodollar rates 
income taxes the income tax provision for was million compared to million for the tax provision reflects an effective tax rate of compared to in net income net income decreased to million in from million in the restructuring charge recorded in reduced net income by million 
liquidity and capital resources we have consistently generated positive cash flow from operations 
specifically  over the last three fiscal years we have generated a total of approximately million  including almost million in these amounts have exceeded net income in all the fiscal years presented due to two factors 
first  we have incurred non cash charges for depreciation and amortization 
second  income tax expense has significantly exceeded taxes actually paid owing to the tax deduction that we continue to utilize that arose from the recapitalization 
these significant tax deductions are to continue for the next ten years 
on an annual basis  this results in tax savings of approximately million per year through assuming sufficient income to realize the full benefit of this deduction 
these internally generated cash flows have been sufficient to fund necessary capital expenditures for our expansion plans 
capital expenditures in were million and were primarily related to i the capital requirements to open new stores and our new yankee candle tm home store  consisting of approximately million in the aggregate  ii investments in manufacturing and logistics of approximately million and iii investments in information systems of approximately million 
capital expenditures were approximately million in and primarily related to similar expenditures 
more specifically  new stores were opened in and we opened a new distribution center in april we anticipate that capital expenditures in will total approximately million and will be spent in a similar manner as in we plan to open approximately new stores in despite significant capital expenditures  operating cash flows have still provided sufficient cash to fund both repayments of our term loan and borrowings under our credit facility 
we currently have a credit agreement with a consortium of banks that was established at the time of our initial public offering 
this credit agreement provides for an initial maximum borrowing of million and consists of a revolving credit facility for million and a term loan for million 
we can elect to set the interest rates on all or a portion of the borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement at a rate per annum equal to a the greatest of the prime rate  the base cd rate plus or the federal funds effective rate plus  plus a margin ranging from to  or b the eurodollar rate plus a margin ranging from to 
the weighted average interest rate on outstanding borrowings at december  was 
our credit agreement requires that we comply with several financial and other covenants  including requirements that we maintain at the end of each fiscal quarter the following financial ratios as set forth in our credit agreement a consolidated total debt to consolidated ebitda ratio of no more than to at december  and for subsequent fiscal quarters at december  this ratio was to 
a fixed charge coverage ratio the ratio of the sum of consolidated ebitda plus lease expense to the sum of consolidated cash interest expense plus lease expense of no less than to at december  and for subsequent fiscal quarters at december  this ratio was to our credit agreement defines ebitda as our consolidated net income excluding extraordinary gains  and gains and losses from material dispositions  plus the amount of net interest expense  depreciation and amortization  income taxes  certain non cash compensation expenses  and certain rental expenses 
ebitda as defined in our credit agreement differs from the definition of ebitda used elsewhere herein  in that it excludes gains and losses from dispositions of material assets and non cash compensation expense 
we have included the amount of these expenses in our more conservative calculation of ebitda used elsewhere  which calculation is therefore lower than ebitda as used in our credit agreement 
this credit arrangement does not mature until no payments of principal are due on the revolving credit facility until this maturity date 
the term loan is payable in quarterly installments ranging from million to million in march  june  september and december of each year commencing on december  as of december   million was outstanding under the revolving credit facility  leaving million in availability 
in addition to obligations to repay our long term debt  we lease the majority of our retail stores under long term operating leases 
the following table summarizes our commitments under both our debt and lease obligations payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total thereafter long term obligations    operating leases        total contractual cash obligations        we believe that cash flow from operations and funds available under our credit agreement have been and will be sufficient for our working capital needs  planned capital expenditures and debt service obligations for at least the next twelve months 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  sfas no 
accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities was issued 
the standard requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
it is to be implemented for restructuring or disposal activities occurring after december  the company s fiscal restructuring activities  as described in note  occurred prior to the effective date of sfas no 
and were therefore accounted for under previously promulgated accounting guidance then in effect specifically  eitf consensus no 
liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
this statement amends fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of statement to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
this standard is effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after december  the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
have been implemented in note and the interim disclosure reporting requirements will be adopted by the company in the first interim period in impact of inflation we do not believe inflation has a significant impact on our operations 
the prices of our products have not varied based on the movement of the consumer price index 
the majority of our material and labor costs have not been materially affected by inflation 
future operating results as referenced above  there are a number of factors that might cause our actual results to differ significantly from the results reflected by the forward looking statements contained herein 
in addition to factors generally affecting the political  economic and competitive conditions in the united states and abroad  such factors include those set forth below 
if we fail to grow our business as planned  our business could suffer and financial results could decline 
as we grow it will be difficult to maintain our historical growth rates 
we intend to continue to pursue a business strategy of increasing sales and earnings by expanding our retail and wholesale operations both in the united states and internationally 
our current plans are to grow internally and not by acquisition 
in particular  our retail growth strategy depends in large part on our ability to open new stores in both existing and new geographic markets 
since our ability to implement our growth strategy successfully will be dependent in part on factors beyond our control  including consumer preferences and our competitive environment  we may not be able to achieve our planned growth or sustain our financial performance 
our ability to anticipate changes in the candle and giftware industries  and identify industry trends  will be critical factors in our ability to remain competitive 
we expect that  as we grow  it will become more difficult to maintain our historical growth rate  which could negatively impact our operating margins and results of operations 
new stores typically generate lower operating margin contributions than mature stores because fixed costs  as a percentage of sales  are higher and because pre opening costs are fully expensed in the year of opening 
in addition  our retail sales generate lower margins than our wholesale sales 
our wholesale business has grown by increasing sales to existing customers and by adding new customers 
if we are not able to continue this  our sales growth and profitability could be adversely affected 
in addition  if we do not effectively manage our growth  we may experience problems such as the supply chain inefficiencies that occurred in due to overstaffing in our manufacturing and logistics operations 
these inefficiencies were corrected in through a workforce reduction and the closing of our salt lake city distribution center  but resulted in a decline in our gross profit in the last quarter of and a restructuring charge of million in we cannot assure that we will continue to grow at a rate comparable to our historic growth rate or that our historic financial performance will continue as we grow 
we face significant competition in the giftware industry 
this competition could cause our revenues or margins to fall short of expectations which could adversely affect our future operating results  financial condition and liquidity and our ability to continue to grow our business 
we compete generally for the disposable income of consumers with other producers in the giftware industry 
the giftware industry is highly competitive with a large number of both large and small participants 
our products compete with other scented and unscented candle and personal care products and with other gifts within a comparable price range  like boxes of candy  flowers  wine  fine soap and related merchandise 
our retail stores compete with franchised candle store chains  specialty candle stores and gift and houseware retailers 
some of our competitors are part of large  diversified companies which have greater financial resources and a wider range of product offerings than we do 
this competitive environment could adversely affect our future revenues and profits  financial condition and liquidity and our ability to continue to grow our business 
a material decline in consumers discretionary income could cause our sales and income to decline 
our results depend on consumer spending  which is influenced by general economic conditions and the availability of discretionary income 
accordingly  we may experience declines in sales during economic downturns or during periods of uncertainty like that which followed the september  terrorist attacks on the united states or which result from the threat of war or the possibility of further terrorist attacks 
any material decline in the amount of discretionary spending could have a material adverse effect on our sales and income 
because we are not a diversified company and are dependent upon one industry  we have less flexibility in reacting to unfavorable consumer trends  adverse economic conditions or business cycles 
we rely primarily on the sale of premium scented candles and related products in the giftware industry 
in the event that sales of these products decline or do not meet our expectations  we cannot rely on the sales of other products to offset such a shortfall 
as a significant portion of our expenses is comprised of fixed costs  such as lease payments  our ability to decrease expenses in response to adverse business conditions is limited in the short term 
as a result  unfavorable consumer trends  adverse economic conditions or changes in the business cycle could have a material and adverse impact on our earnings 
if we lose our senior executive officers  our business could be disrupted and our financial performance could suffer 
our success is substantially dependent upon the retention of our senior executive officers 
if our senior executive officers become unable or unwilling to participate in our business  our future business and financial performance could be materially affected 
many aspects of our manufacturing and distribution facilities are customized for our business  as a result  the loss of one of these facilities would disrupt our operations 
approximately of our sales are generated by products we manufacture at our manufacturing facility in whately  massachusetts and we rely primarily on our distribution facilities in south deerfield  massachusetts to distribute our products 
because most of our machinery is designed or customized by us to manufacture our products  and because we have strict quality control standards for our products  the loss of our manufacturing facility  due to natural disaster or otherwise  would materially affect our operations 
similarly  our distribution facilities rely upon customized machinery  systems and operations  the loss of which would materially affect our operations 
although our manufacturing and distribution facilities are adequately insured  we believe it would take up to twelve months to resume operations at a level equivalent to current operations 
seasonal  quarterly and other fluctuations in our business  and general industry and market conditions  could affect the market for our common stock 
our sales and operating results vary from quarter to quarter 
we have historically realized higher sales and operating income in our fourth quarter  particularly in our retail business  which accounts for a larger portion of our sales 
we believe that this has been due primarily to an increase in giftware industry sales during the holiday season of the fourth quarter 
as a result of this seasonality  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
in addition  we may also experience quarterly fluctuations in our sales and income depending on various factors  including  among other things  the number of new retail stores we open in a particular quarter  changes in the ordering patterns of our wholesale customers during a particular quarter  and the mix of products sold 
most of our operating expenses  such as rent expense  advertising and promotional expense and employee wages and salaries  do not vary directly with sales and are difficult to adjust in the short term 
as a result  if sales for a particular quarter are below our expectations  we might not be able to proportionately reduce operating expenses for that quarter  and therefore a sales shortfall could have a disproportionate effect on our operating results for that quarter 
further  our comparable store sales from our retail business in a particular quarter could be adversely affected by competition  economic or other general conditions or our inability to execute a particular business strategy 
as a result of these factors  we may report in the future sales  operating results or comparable store sales that do not match the expectations of market analysts and investors 
this could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline 
in addition  broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
our two largest stockholders  who are affiliates of forstmann little co  effectively control us and their interests may conflict with those of other stockholders 
partnerships affiliated with forstmann little co 
own approximately of our outstanding common stock and effectively control us 
accordingly  they are able to influence the election of our entire board of directors and  until they no longer own any shares of our common stock  they have the contractual right to nominate two directors to our board of directors  influence our management and policies  and affect the outcome of any corporate transaction or other matter submitted to our stockholders for approval  including mergers  consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets  even where the transaction is not in the best interests of all stockholders 
they may also be able to prevent or cause a change in control of yankee candle and may be able to amend our articles of organization and by laws 
the interests of the forstmann little partnerships also may conflict with the interests of the other holders of common stock 
provisions in our corporate documents and massachusetts law could delay or prevent a change in control of yankee candle 
our articles of organization and by laws may discourage  delay or prevent a merger or acquisition involving yankee candle that our stockholders may consider favorable  by authorizing the issuance of preferred stock  the terms of which may be determined at the sole discretion of the board of directors  providing for a classified board of directors  with staggered three year terms  and establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at meetings 
massachusetts law may also discourage  delay or prevent someone from acquiring or merging with us 
the pledge of substantially all of our assets to secure our obligations under our credit agreement may hinder our ability to obtain additional debt financing on favorable terms 
we have pledged substantially all of our assets to secure our obligations under our credit agreement 
subject to restrictions contained in our credit agreement  we may incur additional indebtedness in the future 
however  due to the pledge of our assets  a creditor lending to us on a senior unsecured basis will be effectively subordinated to our bank lenders 
this could limit our ability to obtain  or obtain on favorable terms  and may make more costly additional debt financing outside of our credit agreement 
while we do not expect to require additional financing prior to the expiration of our credit agreement  if we needed to do so the inability to obtain additional financing on favorable terms could adversely impact our results of operations or inhibit our ability to realize our growth strategy 
we do not currently intend to pay dividends on our capital stock 
we have never paid a cash dividend on our common stock as a public company and we do not currently intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
instead we intend to retain earnings for the future operation of the business 
any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will be dependent upon our results of operations  our financial condition  contractual and legal restrictions and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors 
under the terms of our existing credit agreement  we may not declare or pay dividends on our common stock unless our ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated ebitda is less than or equal to or our aggregate principal amount of loans and letters of credit outstanding is less than million 
although we meet this requirement  we do not currently intend to pay dividends 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s our market risks relate primarily to changes in interest rates 
we bear this risk in two specific ways 
first  we have debt outstanding 
at december   we had million outstanding under our credit agreement  which bears interest at variable rates 
at december   the weighted average interest rate on outstanding borrowings was 
this facility is intended to fund operating needs if necessary 
because this facility carries a variable interest rate pegged to market indices  our results of operations and cash flows will be exposed to changes in interest rates 
based on december  borrowing levels  a increase or decrease in current market interest rates would have the effect of causing an approximately million additional annual pre tax charge or credit to the statement of operations 
the second component of interest rate risk involves the short term investment of excess cash 
this risk impacts fair values  earnings and cash flows 
excess cash is primarily invested in interest bearing accounts that fluctuate with market interest rates 
based on december  cash equivalents  a increase or decrease in current market interest rates would have the effect of causing an approximately million additional pre tax credit or charge to the annual statements of operations 
we buy a variety of raw materials for inclusion in our products 
the only raw material that is considered to be of a commodity nature is wax 
wax is a petroleum based product 
however  its market price has not historically fluctuated with the movement of oil prices 
rather  over the past five years wax prices have generally moved with inflation 
at this point in time  operations outside of the united states are immaterial 
accordingly  we are not exposed to substantial risks arising from foreign currency exchange rates
