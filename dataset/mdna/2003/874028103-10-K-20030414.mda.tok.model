item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  including the related notes  appearing in item of this report 
also  several of the matters discussed in this document contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
such forward looking statements are usually denoted by words or phrases such as believes  expects  projects  estimates  anticipates  will likely result  or similar expressions 
we wish to caution readers that all forward looking statements are necessarily speculative and not to place undue reliance on such forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date made  and to advise readers that actual results could vary due to a variety of risks and uncertainties 
factors associated with the forward looking statements that could cause the forward looking statements to be inaccurate and could otherwise impact our future results are set forth in detail in this report 
in addition to the other information contained in this document  readers should carefully consider the information appearing in item of this report under the heading cautionary statements and risk factors 
overview the company distributes a wide variety of transistors  diodes and other discrete semiconductors  optoelectronic devices and passive components to other electronic distributors  contract electronic manufacturers cems and original equipment manufacturers oems  who incorporated them in their products 
in addition to an overall economic slowdown and excess product availability  we believe the demand for discrete semiconductors in the us market decreased from through the middle of from mid throughout most of  demand increased as a result of industry wide shortages 
however  the industry wide shortage began to diminish towards the end of and demand through today has drastically declined 
in addition to the general economic slowdown  we believe the declining demand in the us market has also resulted from the accelerated trend of moving the production capacity of oem cem customers abroad and the consolidation of cem customers domestically 
the company s core strategy includes maintaining a substantial inventory of discrete and passive components purchased at prices generally lower than those commonly available to its competitors 
this strategy allows the company to fill customer orders immediately from stock held in inventory 
since demand remained weak throughout  the company focused on lowering its inventory balances and changing its product mix 
as a result  inventory levels decreased throughout the year from  as of december  to  as of december   including a non cash provision of approximately  during to increase the company s inventory reserves 
the company has been strategically increasing its marketing efforts for its opto and passive components as part of the total product mix 
as such  the company has recently made strategically significant purchases with its key suppliers to ensure the continuity of its existing franchise lines 
since demand continued to be weak throughout the current period  the company expects to continue lowering inventory balances throughout  not withstanding the key strategic purchases previously mentioned 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  management has classified inventory as a current asset 
however  if all or a substantial portion of the inventory was required to be immediately liquidated  the inventory would not be as readily marketable or liquid as other items included or classified as a current asset  such as cash 
there are no assurances that demand in the discrete semiconductor market will increase and that market conditions will improve 
therefore  it s possible that further declines in our carrying values of inventory may result 
since the beginning of  our gross profit margins in general have been stable or slightly increased mainly because our purchasing price decreases have more than offset the selling price erosion in the down market 
our gross profit margins are subject to a number of factors  including product demand  a strong us dollar  manufacturer s price protection programs  our ability to purchase inventory at favorable prices and our sales product mix 
readers are cautioned that the foregoing statements are forward looking and are necessarily speculative 
there can be no guarantee that a recovery in the discrete semiconductor market will take place 
also  if prices of components held in our inventory decline or if new technology is developed that displaces products distributed by us and held in inventory  our business could be materially adversely affected 
critical accounting policies and estimates use of estimates management has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities to prepare these financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
these estimates have a significant impact on the company s valuation and reserve accounts relating to the allowance for sales returns  doubtful accounts  inventory reserves and deferred income taxes 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized upon shipment of the merchandise 
reserves for sales allowances and customer returns are established based upon historical experience and management s estimates of future returns 
sales returns for the year ended december  were  compared to  for the allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts at december  and were  and  respectively 
the company reviews the actual sales returns and bad debts for its customers and establishes an estimate of future returns and allowance for doubtful accounts 
inventory inventory  consisting principally of products held for resale  is recorded at the lower of cost determined using the first in first out method or estimated market value 
the company had inventory balances in the amounts of  and  at december  and  respectively  which are presented net of valuation allowances of  and  at december  and  respectively 
the company evaluates inventories to identify excess  high cost  slow moving  or other factors rendering inventories as unmarketable at normal profit margins 
for inventories supplied under franchise agreements  the company relies upon its contractual rights to receive compensation for price differences caused by market fluctuations 
due to the large number of transactions and the complexity of managing and maintaining a large inventory of product offerings  estimates are made regarding adjustments to the cost of inventories 
based on our assumptions about future demand and market conditions  inventories are carried at the lower of cost or estimated market value 
if our assumptions about future demand change  and or market conditions are less favorable than those projected  additional write downs of inventories may be required 
in any case  actual amounts could be different from those estimated 
deferred taxes the company reviews the nature of each component of its deferred income taxes for reasonableness 
included in the income tax provision is a total of  in non cash income tax charges related to increasing its reserve against its deferred tax assets 
although the company recorded non cash income tax charges of  in the second quarter  the reserve was reduced by  during the fourth quarter primarily as a result of the anticipated gain on sale of the company s former office warehouse facility that is currently unoccupied  listed for sale and being actively marketed by a real estate agency 
revolving line of credit on august   the company amended its credit facility with its bank 
this amendment accelerated the renewal date from may  to december  and decreased the maximum borrowings under the credit facility from million to million by november  the credit facility contains security agreements covering essentially all assets of the company and requires compliance with certain financial covenants 
also  borrowings under the credit facility were limited to a certain formula  essentially consisting of a portion of the company s account receivables  inventory and fixed assets 
at december  and through the date of this report  the company was in default under its revolving line of credit facility and such defaults have not been cured or waived by the bank 
the bank has also indicated that no further borrowings will be made available under the credit facility 
as of march   the outstanding balance of the credit facility is  accordingly  the bank may demand full and immediate payment of this amount at anytime 
the company has communicated with the bank and submitted a proposal of repaying the credit facility no later than june   which the bank is currently considering 
this repayment plan requires the company to make principal payments by a selling or refinancing its former office warehouse facility  which is currently unoccupied  b financing its accounts receivables and c issuing debt or equity securities 
to the extent the company is not able to sell assets  refinance assets  or issue debt or equity securities  the company may need to liquidate assets to repay the credit facility by june  results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain operating amounts and ratios year ended december  dollars in thousands net sales cost of goods sold of net sales gross profit of net sales selling  general and administrative expenses of net sales operating loss earnings of net sales income tax provision benefit effective tax rate as a of loss earnings before income taxes n a net loss earnings of net sales the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  net sales for the year ended december  were  compared with net sales for of  a decrease of  or 
this decrease was primarily due to an industry wide decrease in demand for discrete semiconductors and passive components resulting from an overall economic slowdown

our export sales decreased by  or when comparing  and  of export sales  for the year and  respectively 
however  the overall average per unit sales price of components increased to cents for the current year from cents during the same time last year 
the increase was primarily the result of selling less passive components  which have a lower average per unit sales price 
cost of goods sold decreased by  to  for the year ended december   a decrease of from cost of goods sold decreased with the decrease in net sales  resulting in gross profits decreasing as a percentage of net sales to for the current year from for the prior year

liquidity and capital resources the company historically has satisfied its liquidity requirements principally through cash generated from operations  short term commercial loans and the sale of equity securities 
the company s cash flows provided by used in operating  financing and investing activities for the years ended december   and were as follows year ended december  in thousands operating activities investing activities financing activities cash flows provided by operating activities increased to  during the year ended december   as compared to  during the increase is primarily attributable to a decrease in inventory of  cash flows used in investing activities was  during the year ended december   as compared to  during cash flows used in financing activities increased to  from  during the year ended december  as compared with  primarily due to an increase in the net re payments on our bank revolving line of credit facility during conversely  the overall decrease in financing cash flow was partially offset by an increase in new subordinated borrowings of  from ks best international co 
ltd  a company controlled by the brother of the company s chief executive officer and an increase in new bank financing of  collateralized by real estate 
the new borrowing was obtained to satisfy a covenant under the company s revolving line of credit facility 
as of the date of this report  the company is in default under its revolving line of credit facility and such defaults have not been cured or waived by the bank 
the bank has also indicated that no further borrowings will be made available under the credit facility 
as of march   the outstanding balance of the credit facility is  accordingly  the bank may demand full and immediate payment of this amount at anytime 
the company has communicated with the bank and submitted a proposal of repaying the credit facility no later than june   which the bank is currently considering 
accordingly  cash flows from financing activities may change significantly in the following three months due to anticipated principal payments on the company s revolving line of credit facility and the possible re financing of company assets and issuance of new debt or equity securities to fund these principal payments 
the company believes that new sources of asset based lending on real estate and or accounts receivables and issuance of debt or equity securities will be required according to our proposal to repay the revolving line of credit facility by june  there can be no guarantee that this asset based financing or the issuance of new debt or equity securities can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms and conditions and as of the date of this report  we have no commitments for other equity  debt financing or other capital expenditures 
in conjunction with any funds received as a result of sales of assets  refinancing of assets  issuance of debt or equity securities related to repayment of the revolving line of credit facility discussed above  we believe that funds generated from operations and new sources of asset based lending on accounts receivables  is likely to be sufficient to finance our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future or until principal payments are due under the bank s credit facility 
to the extent the company is not able to secure other new sources of asset based lending on accounts receivables  issue debt or equity securities  the company may need to liquidate assets to generate the necessary working capital 
the company is in violation of certain conditions and covenants see revolving line of credit discussed above and therefore the bank may demand full payment at anytime 
inventory is included in current assets  however  it is likely to take over one year for the inventory to turn and therefore is likely not to be saleable within a one year time frame 
hence  inventory would not be as readily marketable or liquid as other items included in current assets  such as cash 
foreign economic issues many of the company s suppliers have their manufacturing facilities in countries whose economies continue to be volatile while recovering from recent years of financial concerns 
although local currencies have stabilized  the us dollar s strength compared with asian currencies may further reduce exports to asia in the future 
conversely  the company believes that the weaker asian currencies may actually benefit the company in the short term by providing opportunities for the company to purchase products at lower prices 
subsequent events on january   the company received notice from nasdaq that compliance with marketplace rule a the rule has been obtained 
the rule requires that the company s class a common stock maintain a minimum market value of publicly held shares of  for continued inclusion by the rule 
therefore  the matter as announced in the company s form q for the period ended september  and form k on january  is now closed and resolved 
on february   the company issued a new subordinated promissory note in the amount of  to ks best international co 
ltd  a company controlled by the brother of the company s chief executive officer 
this promissory note bears interest at per annum  requires monthly principal payments of  beginning may  including monthly interest at each month end and matures september  this new borrowing was obtained to pay down the company s revolving line of credit facility see revolving line of credit footnote
