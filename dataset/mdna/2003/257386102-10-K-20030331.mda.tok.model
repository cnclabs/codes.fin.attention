item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading builder of high quality  single family homes in central ohio primarily the columbus metropolitan statistical area and louisville  kentucky 
our customer driven focus targets entry level and move up buyers 
we offer three distinct series of homes that are differentiated by price  size  standard features and available options 
the homes range in price from approximately  to  and in size from approximately  to  square feet 
our net income for increased to a record million  or per diluted share  from million  or per diluted share  for the increase in diluted earnings per share occurred despite the fact that we sold  of our common shares in a public offering during the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding during the twelve months ended december  increased to  from  shares during the twelve months ended december  during  the diluted earnings per share will be impacted by the full number of common shares issued in the public offering 
sales contracts for the year ended december  increased to  from  for and the aggregate sales value of contracts increased to million from million for our backlog on december  was  sales contracts  with an aggregate sales value of million  compared to a backlog on december  of  sales contracts  with an aggregate sales value of million 
the operating results are due  in part  to a change in product philosophy that we began implementing in when we changed from being an option based builder targeting the first and second time move up buyer to a production builder targeting the entry level and first time move up buyer 
the strategy was to design more affordable homes  provide the customer with an easy and satisfying buying experience and streamline the building process to create cost efficiencies  shorter build times  and higher quality construction 
in december  we introduced our new independence series with prices starting at  the independence series has expanded the potential customer base that can afford our homes 
in and  we simplified and value engineered our other series of homes  the celebration and tradition series 
we have incorporated into our homes many popular features that our competitors typically offer as options 
by decreasing the number of options available  we have increased the efficiency of our homebuilding process which lowered the cost of building these homes  decreased the build times necessary to complete them and improved the building experience of our customers 
in  we intend to continue our three point growth strategy which is to increase market share in central ohio primarily by expanding our independence series of homes  increase market share in louisville  kentucky  and expand to a new market 
our market share in central ohio increased to in from in  primarily due to increased closings from our new entry level independence series of homes 
in  we expect to continue to increase the number of communities in which we offer independence series homes 
we have been in the louisville  kentucky market for four years and have become the largest single family homebuilder in this market with approximately a market share 
our goal in is to increase our investment in this subsidiary by to 
we hope to make an announcement concerning a new market by the end of the summer in evaluating potential new markets  we look for a market that has many of the following characteristics a location in the midwest  a potential for economies of scale  a highly fragmented homebuilder market  a stable and diverse economy  demographics similar to our current markets and compatibility with our existing product offerings 
the early and harsh winter throughout the midwest  as well as regulatory delays in opening a few communities  will likely have an impact on our results 
however  our sales in early have been good so we remain cautiously optimistic about the year 
on february   we announced that our board of directors had authorized the repurchase of up to  of our common shares 
the repurchase plan will end december  the repurchase of common shares will be funded by internally generated cash and our existing credit facility  and we will hold repurchased shares as treasury shares 
the repurchase program was implemented due to the board of director s confidence in our long term prospects and belief that our common shares represent an attractive investment opportunity 
accordingly  on february   we amended our bank credit facility to increase  from  to million in any one year and million during the term of the facility  the dollar amount of our common shares that we are allowed to repurchase 
during the first quarter of  we purchased  common shares at an aggregate purchase price of million 
safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation act of this report contains various forward looking statements within the meaning of applicable securities laws 
such statements can be identified by the use of the forward looking words anticipate  estimate  project  believe  intend  expect  hope or similar words 
these statements discuss future expectations  contain projections regarding future developments  operations or financial conditions  or state other forward looking information 
these forward looking statements involve various important risks  uncertainties and other factors which could cause our actual results for and beyond to differ materially from those expressed in the forward looking statements 
included among such important risks  uncertainties and other factors are the following we are particularly affected by national and local general economic  business and other conditions 
our financial position and results from operations are affected by changes and cycles in national and local general economic  business and other conditions  most of which are beyond our control 
these conditions include employment levels changing demographics availability and affordability of mortgage financing consumer confidence and housing demand competitive overbuilding availability and cost of building lots availability and cost of materials and labor adverse weather conditions and natural disasters cost overruns inflation changes in governmental regulations changes in tax laws changes in local government fees availability and cost of rental property and resale prices of existing homes in addition  domestic terrorist attacks and the threat or the involvement of the united states in international armed conflict may also adversely affect general economic conditions  consumer confidence and the homebuilding markets 
adverse weather conditions may prevent or delay the construction of homes and reduce the number of home sales 
poor weather conditions can hinder our construction and development activities  and thereby increase the cost of constructing our homes and delay the closing of our homes and our recognition of revenue from such closings 
in addition  in cases of prolonged severe weather  potential home buyers may delay or forgo the purchase of a home 
delays in construction of our homes could cause mortgage commitments to expire 
delays in the construction of a home could cause the mortgage commitment to expire and could require us  if mortgage interest rates have increased  to pay significant amounts to the mortgage lender to extend the original mortgage interest rates 
we are dependent upon the availability and affordability of residential mortgage financing 
virtually all purchasers of our homes finance their purchase through third party lenders who offer conventional  fha and va mortgage financing 
a material increase in mortgage interest rates or unfavorable changes to these lending programs would adversely affect the ability of prospective home buyers  particularly our targeted entry level home buyers  to obtain mortgage financing 
we are also dependent upon the availability and cost of mortgage financing for buyers of the current homes owned by potential purchasers of our homes 
prior to purchasing our homes  some of our home buyers must sell their current homes  and these sales are dependent upon the availability and cost of mortgage financing 
in addition  because the majority of our home buyers use fha mortgage financing  a material reduction in the scope or funding of fha mortgage programs could have a material adverse effect on our sales 
in particular  a substantial number of our home buyers use down payment assistance programs  which allow home buyers to receive gift funds from non profit corporations to be used as a down payment 
at one time  hud proposed rules which would have prohibited the use of gift fund programs in conjunction with fha insured mortgage loans 
hud subsequently withdrew these proposed rules but has continued to increase its regulation of gift fund programs 
if hud would prohibit or make materially unfavorable changes to the use of gift fund programs  we would expect to offer  as we have in the past  a different type of down payment program 
there can be no assurance that any such replacement program would be as attractive to home buyers as the programs offered today and that our sales would not suffer 
we are significantly leveraged and are dependent upon the availability of financing 
we incur significant up front expenditures for land acquisition  development and construction costs 
we have traditionally financed these costs with bank borrowings  internally generated funds and joint venture arrangements 
although we have not in recent years experienced problems in obtaining financing  we cannot be sure that continued financing will be available to us in the future  or that any financing available to us will be on favorable terms 
our ability to make payments of principal or interest on  or to refinance our indebtedness  will depend on our future operating performance and successful execution of our business strategy 
developing our own land and building inventory homes involves significant risks 
we currently are developing approximately of the communities in which we are building homes 
therefore  our short and long term financial success is and will continue to be dependent upon our ability to acquire land  adjust our strategy for purchasing land  and develop communities successfully 
we commit substantial financial and managerial resources to acquire land and develop the streets  utility services and other infrastructure before any revenues are generated from the community 
we may acquire and develop land upon which we cannot  or choose not to  build or sell homes 
the market value of undeveloped land and building lots fluctuates 
we also build some homes before we obtain non cancelable sale contracts for those homes 
we may have to hold these unsold inventory homes for an indefinite time prior to a sale 
in addition  because market prices fluctuate  we may have to sell inventory homes at a loss 
government regulations and environmental considerations affect us in many ways 
we are subject to local  state and federal requirements concerning zoning  resource protection  building design and construction  and similar matters 
these requirements include local regulations  which impose restrictive zoning and density requirements to limit the number of homes that can eventually be built within the boundaries of a particular location 
particularly in the case of local political subdivisions  anti growth sentiments can lead to ballot measures that can interfere with or impede our ability to develop land or build homes 
these requirements also affect construction activities  including construction materials  which must be used in home construction  as well as sales activities and other dealings with home buyers 
we also must obtain licenses  permits and approvals from various governmental agencies for our development activities  the granting of which are beyond our control 
obtaining acceptable zoning and overcoming objections of neighborhood groups and citizen activists is becoming more difficult  time consuming and expensive 
there can be no assurance that these issues will not adversely affect the company in the future 
we also are subject to a variety of local  state and federal requirements concerning the protection of health and the environment 
the particular environmental laws  which apply to any given project  vary greatly according to the project site and the present and former uses of the property 
these environmental laws may result in delays and cause us to incur substantial compliance costs  including substantial expenditures for pollution and water quality control 
these laws may prohibit or severely restrict development in certain environmentally sensitive regions 
in an effort to avoid major environmental issues in our developments  we have a general practice of requiring environmental reports from qualified  independent professionals and resolution of identified environmental issues prior to purchasing land 
however  we cannot be sure that we will not incur material liabilities relating to the removal of toxic wastes or other environmental matters affecting land that we have acquired 
building moratoria may result in periodic delays or may preclude us from developing certain projects 
these moratoria generally result from insufficient water supplies or sewer facilities  delays in utility hookups  inadequate road capacity or anti growth sentiment within the specific market area or community 
these moratoria can occur before or after we start our operations and without notice or recourse 
to date  moratoriums have not had a material adverse effect on our business 
we operate in two geographic areas 
we currently operate in central ohio and louisville  kentucky 
our lack of geographic diversity means that adverse general economic or weather conditions in either of these markets could have a material adverse impact on our operations 
expansion strategies contain inherent risks 
we continually evaluate opportunities to expand into new markets whether through acquisitions or start up operations 
any expansion strategy involves many risks 
new markets may prove to be less stable than our current markets and may result in delays  problems and expenses not typically encountered in our current markets 
regulations in various states may prohibit or impede us from using some of our community development strategies  such as those utilized with the independence series that require condominium or other high density housing 
we may fail to identify suitable acquisition candidates or complete acquisitions on acceptable terms 
the magnitude  timing and nature of acquisitions will depend upon various factors  including the availability of suitable acquisition candidates  financial resources and skilled employees to manage the acquired companies  the negotiation of acceptable terms  and general economic and business conditions 
the likelihood of our success in establishing start up operations also depends on similar factors  including identification of suitable start up markets  availability of financial resources and skilled employees and subcontractors  and general economic and business conditions 
in addition  because start up operations may require significant lead time before they generate sufficient revenues to be profitable 
expansion through acquisitions or start up operations will require substantial attention from our management team 
the diversion of management s attention  as well as any other difficulties that may be encountered in the transition and integration process  could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
introduction of new product offerings has inherent risks 
we have recently introduced and will continue to introduce new home designs and new community concepts as part of our product offerings 
there are significant risks that we may not accurately predict the tastes or preferences of potential home buyers 
a failure to predict these tastes or preferences could have a material adverse effect on our sales 
we are dependent on key personnel 
we have several key executive officers  the loss or prolonged absence of whom could have an adverse effect on our operations 
in particular  the loss of the services or prolonged absence of douglas borror  our chairman and chief executive officer  or jon donnell  our president and chief operating officer  could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
our future success will depend on our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel  of which there can be no assurance 
our results historically vary on a quarterly basis 
our business is significantly affected by changes in economic cycles  and our revenues and earnings vary with the level of general economic activity in the markets where we build homes 
we historically have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  variability in revenues and reported earnings on a quarterly basis 
a significant percentage of our sales contracts are executed during the first and second quarters of the year 
closing on a home typically occurs approximately six months after the date of the sales contract but  with weather and other delays  may take longer 
we do not recognize any revenue on the sale of a home until the closing occurs 
as a result  we historically have experienced higher closings and revenues during the second half of the year 
we are subject to warranty claims arising in the ordinary course of business that could be costly 
as a homebuilder we are subject to construction defect and home warranty claims arising in the ordinary course of business 
these claims are common in the homebuilding industry and can be costly 
we provide warranties on our homes for periods as long as thirty years 
in the event that we experience greater warranty claims than we anticipate  we could incur significant expenses which could affect future earnings 
litigation related to construction defects could adversely affect our business 
litigation related to construction defects has increased significantly in recent years 
the homebuilding industry has experienced both an increase in the number of individual claims for construction defects as well as increased costs of insuring against such claims 
our financial results are subject to inflation and other cost increases 
we are not always able to reflect all cost increases in the prices of our homes because competitive pressures and other factors sometimes require us to maintain or discount those prices 
while we attempt to maintain costs with subcontractors from the date a sales contract with a customer is accepted until the date construction is completed  we may incur unanticipated costs which cannot be passed on to the customer 
material or labor shortages can adversely affect our business 
during periods of increased construction activity  the homebuilding industry has faced shortages in the availability of skilled labor 
waiting for skilled labor to become available may result in construction delays 
the use of less skilled labor to satisfy a skilled labor shortage may cause quality standards to suffer 
increases in the demand for skilled labor also can result in increases in the cost of skilled labor 
the principal raw materials used in the homebuilding industry are lumber  brick and concrete as well as plumbing and electrical supplies 
while these materials are generally available from a variety of sources  they are subject to periodic price fluctuations 
in particular  the homebuilding industry has experienced occasional lumber shortages which produced significant price increases 
because we may not be able to pass on to our customers price increases in raw materials or labor  future price increases in these items could have a material adverse effect on our operating margins and earnings 
the homebuilding industry is highly competitive 
we compete in each of our geographic markets with national  regional and local homebuilders  some of which have greater financial  marketing  land acquisition and sales resources than we do 
we compete not only for home buyers  but also for desirable properties  financing  raw materials and skilled labor 
we also compete with the resale market for existing homes  which some home buyers may prefer over new homes 
additionally  there are many other national and regional homebuilders  many of which have greater financial  marketing  land acquisition and sales resources than we do  that do not currently have a significant presence in either of our current markets 
a concerted effort by these homebuilders to enter or expand their current operations in either or both of our markets could have an adverse impact on our sales 
we are restricted by covenants in our bank credit facility 
our bank credit facility imposes restrictions on our operations and activities 
some of the more significant restrictions limit leases speculative and model home inventory to million  the aggregate investment in homebuilding operations in markets other than central ohio or louisville  kentucky  of which no more than million can be invested in start up operations the amount that we may borrow outside of the bank credit facility and the amount of contingent obligations that we can assume the amount we may borrow under the bank credit facility based upon borrowing base limitations the amount of our uncommitted land holdings and unzoned land purchases the payment of dividends 
application of critical accounting policies requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that may impact our future financial results 
in preparing our financial statements  management is required to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the annual and quarterly reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and disclosures about contingent assets and liabilities 
our actual results could be different from these estimates and assumptions 
some of the more critical accounting policies include reserves to reduce our real estate inventories to net realizable values estimates for construction costs for homes closed reserves for the estimated warranty cost of homes estimates of the costs to complete land development estimates of the annualized capitalization rate for indirect overhead and other expenses estimates of the annual effective tax rate in interim periods 
seasonality and variability in quarterly results we experience significant seasonality and quarter to quarter variability in our homebuilding activity 
typically  closings and related revenues increase in the second half of the year 
we believe this seasonality reflects the tendency of home buyers to shop for a new home in the spring with the goal of closing in the fall or winter 
weather conditions can also accelerate or delay the scheduling of closings

we recognize revenue and cost of real estate sold at the time of closing 
closings or deliveries occur when we deliver the deed to the buyer and we receive payment for the home 
we include a home in backlog when a home buyer signs our standard sales contract  but the closing has not occurred as of the end of the period 
homes included in sales contracts in the foregoing table are net of cancellations 
most cancellations occur when home buyers cannot qualify for financing 
while most cancellations occur prior to the start of construction  some cancellations occur during the construction process 
the cancellation rates for homes in backlog as of december    and were   and  respectively 
we annually incur a substantial amount of indirect construction costs  which are essentially fixed in nature 
for purposes of quarterly financial reporting  we capitalize these costs to real estate inventories based on the ratio of estimated annual indirect costs to direct construction costs to be incurred 
thus  variations in construction activity cause fluctuations in interim and annual gross profits 
compared to revenues 
our revenues for increased by to million from the delivery of  homes compared to revenues for of million from the delivery of  homes 
this million increase in revenues was primarily due to the delivery of more homes resulting from an overall improvement in build times in all series of homes 
included in the  homes delivered in were homes  with a sales value of million that we sold to unaffiliated third parties and leased back for use as model homes and sales offices 
we did not sell and leaseback any homes in as expected  the average price of homes delivered in decreased or  to  from  in the lower average price of delivered homes in was the result of closing a larger percentage of our new entry level series of homes 
included in revenues are other revenues  consisting principally of fees from the company s mortgage financing services subsidiary 
during  these other revenues increased by to million of which million was from mortgage financing service fees 
other revenues for amounted to million  million of which was from mortgage financing service fees 
gross profit 
our gross profit for increased by to million from million for the primary reasons for the increase in gross profit were the larger number of homes delivered during  the reduced cost associated with mortgage financing contributions due to falling interest rates and increased mortgage financing service fees 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expenses for increased by to million from million for the primary reasons for the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses for were the higher sales commissions associated with the sale of more homes  payment of higher compensation due to improved profits and general and administrative expenses of our mortgage financing services subsidiary 
interest expense 
our interest expense for decreased by to million from million for  as a result of the reduction of debt from our sale of common shares and a lower average borrowing rate 
the average revolving line of credit borrowings outstanding were million and million for and  respectively 
the weighted average rate of interest under the revolving line of credit was for compared to for provision for income taxes 
our income tax expense for increased to million from million for the company s estimated annual effective tax rate decreased to for  from for compared to revenues 
our revenues for increased by to million from the delivery of  homes compared to revenues for of million from the delivery of  homes 
this million increase in revenues was primarily due to the delivery of more homes at a higher average delivery price and the increased revenues from the mortgage financing services subsidiary 
included in the  homes delivered in were homes  with a total sales value of million that we sold to unaffiliated third parties and leased back for use as model homes and sales offices 
included in the  homes delivered in were homes  with a total sales value of million that we sold to unaffiliated third parties and leased back for use as model homes and sales offices 
the average price of homes delivered in increased to  from  in  an increase of  or  per home 
lower mortgage interest rates and increased fha mortgage limits during  allowed our home buyers to buy more expensive homes while minimizing their required down payments 
included in revenues are other revenues  consisting primarily of revenues from our mortgage financing services subsidiary and the sale of land 
these other revenues during amounted to million  of which million was from mortgage financing service fees  compared to other revenues during of million  of which million was from mortgage financing service fees 
gross profit 
our gross profit for increased by to million from million for this million increase was primarily due to the delivery of more homes  the increase in the average sales price of delivered homes  the reduced costs we paid on our home buyers mortgage financing  the increased revenues from the mortgage financing services subsidiary and a reduction in direct construction costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expenses for increased by to million from million for this million increase was primarily due to the increased variable costs associated with delivering more homes at a higher average sales price and of operating the mortgage financing services subsidiary 
interest expense 
our interest expense for increased by to million from million for this million increase was due to the higher average borrowings under our bank credit facility 
the increased borrowings were somewhat offset by the lower weighted average interest rate we paid during we incurred higher average borrowings due to having more homes and more expensive homes under construction during and we increased our investment in real estate inventories 
the average borrowings outstanding under our bank credit facility were million for compared to million for the weighted average rate of interest on our total borrowings was for compared to for provision for income taxes 
our income tax expense for increased by to million from million for our estimated annual effective tax rate for increased to from for liquidity and capital resources historically  our capital needs have depended upon sales volume  asset turnover  land acquisition and inventory levels 
our traditional sources of capital have been internally generated cash  bank borrowings and seller financing 
we have incurred indebtedness in the past and expect to incur indebtedness in the future to fund our operations and our investment in land 
sources and uses of cash for the three year period ended december  during  we generated million of cash flow from operations before expenditures on real estate inventories 
we also raised approximately million in cash from the sale of  common shares  and we used this cash to reduce debt under our bank credit facility 
our real estate inventories increased by million because homes under construction increased by million and land and land development and other costs increased by million 
we utilized cash from operations together with borrowings under our bank credit facility to finance the increase in real estate inventories 
during  we generated million of cash flow from operations before expenditures on real estate inventories 
our real estate inventories increased by million because homes under construction grew by million and land and land development and other costs increased by million 
we utilized cash from operations together with borrowings under our bank credit facility to finance the increase in real estate inventories 
during  we generated million of cash flow from operations before expenditures on real estate inventories 
our real estate inventories grew by million because homes under construction increased by million and land and land development and other costs increased by million 
we utilized cash from operations together with borrowings under our bank credit facility to finance the increase in real estate inventories 
real estate inventories we are currently developing approximately of the communities in which we are building homes 
we generally do not purchase land for resale 
we attempt to maintain a land inventory sufficient to meet our anticipated lot needs for the next three to five years 
at december   we owned lots or land that we estimate could be developed into  lots  including lots in louisville  kentucky 
we controlled through option agreements or contingent contracts land that we estimate could be developed into  additional lots  including lots in louisville  kentucky 
these option agreements expire at various dates through during  we exercised options to purchase  lots  including lots in louisville  kentucky 
we decide whether to exercise any particular option or otherwise acquire additional land based upon our assessment of a number of factors  including our existing land inventory at the time and our evaluation of the future demand for our homes 
our real estate inventories at december   increased million to million compared to million at december  real estate inventories include land and land development costs  homes under construction and other building materials 
as of december   land and land development costs increased to million from million on december   homes under construction increased to million from million on december  and other building material inventories decreased to million from million on december  our land and land development costs increased principally due to the increased number of sales communities required to support our independence series 
we selectively enter into joint ventures with other homebuilders to own and develop communities 
the participants in the joint ventures acquire substantially all of the lots developed by the joint ventures and fund the development costs of the joint ventures 
in certain cases  we may be liable under debt commitments within the particular joint venture 
as of december   we were party to one joint venture that finances its own development activities 
we have guaranteed the obligations under the joint venture s loan agreement up to million  representing our one half interest 
at december   the joint venture had  in loans outstanding and the portion guaranteed by us was  on december   we had single family inventory homes  including in louisville  kentucky  in various stages of construction  representing an aggregate investment of million  compared to single family inventory homes  including in louisville  kentucky  in various stages of construction  representing an aggregate investment of million on december  we do not include inventory homes in sales or backlog 
land purchase commitments on december   we had commitments to purchase residential lots and unimproved land at an aggregate cost of million  net of approximately  in good faith deposits  or guarantees 
we intend to purchase this land over the next few years 
on december   we also had million of cancelable obligations to purchase residential lots and unimproved land  net of million in good faith deposits or guarantees 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item below 
cancelable obligations consist of options under which we have the right but not the obligation to purchase land and contingent purchase contracts under which our obligation to purchase land is subject to the satisfaction of zoning  utilities  environmental  title or other contingencies 
we expect to purchase most of the residential lots and unimproved land that we have under contract  provided we can obtain adequate zoning and if no other significant obstacles to development arise 
we expect to fund our land acquisition and development obligations from internally generated cash and from the borrowing capacity under our bank credit facility 
inflation and other cost increases we are not always able to reflect all of our cost increases in the prices of our homes because competitive pressures and other factors sometimes require us to maintain or discount those prices 
while we attempt to maintain costs with subcontractors from the date a sales contract with a customer is accepted until the date construction is completed  we may incur unanticipated costs which cannot be passed on to the customer 
for example  delays in construction of a home can cause the mortgage commitment to expire and can require us  if mortgage interest rates have increased  to pay significant amounts to the mortgage lender to extend the original mortgage interest rate 
in addition  during periods of high construction activities  we may incur additional costs to obtain subcontractors when certain trades are not readily available  which additional costs can result in lower gross profits 
debt and other obligations on december   we entered into an amended and restated million senior unsecured revolving credit facility the facility 
eight banks participate in the facility  led by huntington national bank  which serves as the administrative agent and issuing bank under the facility 
for a more detailed description of the bank facility  including restrictions on our business activities  see note to the consolidated financial statements in item below 
in addition to the amendments described in note of the consolidated financial statements  the facility was further amended on february  to increase the dollar amount of our common shares that we are allowed to repurchase from  to million during any fiscal year or million in the aggregate after december  during the first quarter of  we purchased  common shares for an aggregate purchase price of million 
the facility provides for a variable rate of interest on our borrowings 
the variable rate is based on either the bank s prime rate or the three month libor rate plus a margin based on our interest coverage ratio that ranges from to and is determined quarterly 
in order to reduce the risks caused by interest rate fluctuations  we have entered into interest rate swap contracts that fix the interest rate on a portion of our borrowings under the facility 
additional information regarding the interest rate swap contracts we have entered into is set forth below under the heading quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in item a below 
as of december   we were in compliance with the facility covenants and had million available under the facility  after adjustment for borrowing base limitations 
borrowing availability under the facility could increase  depending on our use of the proceeds of borrowings under the facility 
we purchased land for development that was partially financed with seller provided term debt with an outstanding balance of  at december  we expect to repay this debt during the following is a summary of our contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments at december  in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years after years term obligations note payable  banks term debt capital lease obligations operating leases land purchase commitments total contractual cash obligations amount of commitment expiration per period total amounts committed less than year years years after years other commercial commitments letters of credit performance bonds guarantees cancelable land contracts total commercial commitments recently issued accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued fasb interpretation no

the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates including those related to real estate inventories  warranty obligations  and construction costs for homes closed 
we base these estimates on historical trends and experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions

estimates for land and land development costs are allocated to development phases based on the total number of lots expected to be developed within each community and are based on detailed budgets for the land development project and historical experience and trends 
if actual costs or the total number of lots developed changes  significant variances may be encountered 
estimates for capitalized overhead and interest costs are recorded in real estate inventories for interim financial reporting purposes 
annualized capitalization rates for indirect overhead and interest are determined by estimating the total current year projected development costs  indirect construction costs  interest  closings and ending inventory

a deferred tax asset or liability is recognized whenever there are future tax effects from existing temporary differences and tax credit carryforwards 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the balance that is more likely than not to be realized 
the company uses an estimate of its annual effective tax rate at each interim period based on the facts and circumstances available at that time  while the actual effective tax rate is calculated at year end 
if circumstances change  our estimated annual effective tax rate could change  creating variances in quarterly results 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   we were a party to six interest rate swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of million  as reflected in the table below 
we enter into swap contracts to minimize earnings fluctuations caused by interest rate volatility associated with our variable rate debt 
the swap contracts allow us to have variable rate borrowings and to select the level of fixed rate debt for the company as a whole 
under the swap contracts  we agree with other parties to exchange  at specified intervals  the difference between fixed rate and floating rate amounts calculated by reference to an agreed notional amount 
the level of fixed rate debt on december   after considering the effect of the swap contracts  is approximately of total borrowings under the facility 
we do not enter into derivative financial instrument transactions for speculative purposes
