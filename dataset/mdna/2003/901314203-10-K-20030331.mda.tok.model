overview we develop and provide technology driven solutions for interactive marketing 
our open adsystem platform  based on our patent protected technology  empowers internet marketers to target  convert and retain their best online customers and manage and protect customer relationships 
we offer the clear alternative for internet marketers who do not want their customer information systematically gathered by a third party ad serving company for its own commercial prospecting and database purposes 
with our proprietary solutions  our customers remain in control of the consumer information generated by their internet marketing campaigns and use that information in real time to optimize their marketing efforts 
we work closely with our customers to implement integrated  value enhancing solutions to manage critical aspects of internet marketing from ad sales and media representation to campaign planning  execution and optimization as well as audience measurement and analysis 
we believe our technology solutions  and our media and marketing services  offer highly controllable and cost effective methods for generating advertising revenue consistent with the goal of building and protecting customer relationships 
we generate revenue in two business segments integrated media solutions and technology solutions 
integrated media solutions our media solutions consist of the following services i the web alliance  a global alliance of web sites where advertisers can place a global run of network ad campaign  or target ads by content  by geography  by time or by part of day  ii website results  a performance based search engine pay for inclusion service where we perform a custom buildout containing all relevant keywords and keyword phrases and advertisers pay only when users search on one of those phrases and click through to the advertiser s website from search listings  and iii other services including desktop messaging services and brokerage activities for internet promotions and e mail marketing 
our web alliance includes the network of web sites  which uses our open adstream technology solutions to deliver and manage internet advertisements  and our portfolio  which comprises web sites with whom we provide services independent of our network 
we generate revenue through the web alliance from fees paid by client advertisers 
we typically offer advertisers a pricing model based on cost per thousand impressions cpm enabling a client advertiser to pay a fee based on the number of times its ad is viewed 
we may also offer advertisers performance based pricing models that may include cost per click cpc pricing allowing a client advertiser to pay us only when a user clicks on the advertiser s ad or performs a specific action  such as a clicking on a uniform resource link url  downloading software  registering for membership or other transactions 
we share the revenue generated through the web alliance with web sites included in the web alliance 
with respect to our network web sites  our revenue share generally ranges between and depending on  among other things  our web site partner s audience size  number of unique visitors  impressions and page views  and the prominence of our partner s brand name 
with respect to our portfolio web sites  our revenue share ranges between and depending on similar factors 
the following table shows by quarter the number of active advertiser accounts and the number of paid impressions since january  we believe that metrics prior to are not comparable due to the acquisition of real media 
number of active client accounts number of paid impressions in billions q q q q we generate revenue through website results from fees paid by advertisers 
we offer advertisers a cpc pricing model 
we use proprietary technology to help internet marketers determine a set of keyword phrases most relevant to their site and agree on a cpc fee they will pay for traffic directed to their web sites 
through our search engine relationships  we help ensure that our clients are well represented in the search results for the selected keyword phrases 
we share the revenue generated through website results with our search engine partners 
our revenue share may range between and depending on  among other things  our distribution partner s size  number of unique visitors  impressions and the number of searches conducted  and the prominence of our partner s brand 
the following table shows by quarter the number of active advertiser accounts and the number of valid visitors for website results since january  number of active client accounts number of valid visitors in millions q q q q in order to increase our revenue  we must continue to increase the number of advertisers we service  the number of paid ad impressions and click throughs on the web alliance and our portfolio web sites  the number of valid visitors to web sites of our search marketing clients and the cpm or cpc fees that we earn 
we drive ad impressions and click throughs by increasing the number of web sites in the web alliance and other web sites for whom we provide services  and by building relationships with web sites that have deep  high quality content and large audiences 
we drive traffic to our website results clients primarily by adding new search engine distribution partners and improving our placement with existing distribution partners 
technology solutions our technology solutions consist of the following products and services i the open adstream software oas local  a turnkey internet advertising delivery and management solution installed locally on our clients servers  ii the open adstream service oas central  an internet advertising delivery and management service for website publishers using our open adstream software distributed centrally from our servers on an application service provider basis  iii the open insight service  a service that uses our proprietary software to measure and analyze audience behavior for client web sites  and iv the open advertiser service oad  an internet advertising delivery and management service for advertisers and ad agencies distributed centrally from our servers on an application service provider basis 
we generate revenue from licensing our open adstream software to client web sites 
our license agreements typically provide for an upfront license fee and a software maintenance and service fee 
we negotiate license fees based on  among other things  the forecasted number of impressions a client website will deliver using our software and several other factors 
to a lesser extent  we also generate revenue by providing professional services charged at an hourly rate 
we generate revenue from our open adstream service from fees paid by client web sites 
we typically offer web sites a cpm based pricing model allowing the client web site to pay us based on ad impressions 
for these client web sites  an impression includes the delivery by us at their request of any advertisement or other marketing material 
our oas central revenue is determined by multiplying the cpm rate by the number of impressions delivered and is typically billed on a monthly basis 
to a lesser extent  we also generate revenue from fees paid to us by our client web sites for trafficking their advertisements 
trafficking advertisements typically refers to entering advertisement creative material and campaign specifications into our software engine 
we generate revenue from our newly acquired open insight service from fees paid by client web sites 
we typically offer web sites page view based pricing enabling the client website to pay us based on how many page views are measured 
our service revenue is calculated by multiplying the cpm rate by the number of page views delivered 
to a lesser extent  we also generate revenue by providing professional services charged at an hourly rate 
we acquired insight first in january and  therefore  have not yet generated significant revenue from this product offering 
beginning in  we will generate revenue from our open advertiser service from fees paid by client advertisers and agencies 
we have been generating revenue from open advertiser in europe since mid domestically  we have not generated significant revenue from our open advertiser service because it is in development and existing customers are in the beta implementation process 
we expect to launch our open advertiser service in the united states in the summer of the following table shows by quarter certain metrics for our technology solutions for we believe that metrics for periods prior to are not comparable because our technology solutions then included a different product mix 
oas local oas central and oad number of active client accounts number of active client accounts number of paid impressions in billions q q q q in order to increase our revenue from our open adstream solutions  and our open insight and open advertiser solutions  we must continue to increase the number of client web publishers and advertisers we service  the number of paid ad impressions delivered using our services  and the licensing or cpm fee that we earn 
we believe we can increase the number of clients to whom we provide technology and services  and the license fees and cpm fees we charge  by developing and providing next generation technology products and services  including launching our open advertiser service  and by leveraging the design features of our technology and services to increase our ability to target high quality audience segments 
since the formation of real media through the merger of media  inc and real media  inc 
in october  we have established a track record of improved operating results and innovation 
each of our predecessors was an early and successful entrant in the internet advertising market 
media  our predecessor  has been publicly traded since august and was formed earlier that year in a consolidation of three internet advertising companies 
real media was a privately held company that commenced sales of its internet advertising solutions  including the first generation of our open adstream software  in real media finished as the one of the few remaining online integrated media and technology players 
in december  the alliance served billion impressions  website results had active customer accounts  and our technology solutions were used by approximately clients worldwide 
our customers continue to rely on the combination of our proprietary technology and our comprehensive suite of media and marketing services as a means of driving advertising revenue consistent with the goal of building and protecting their customer relationships 
with the acquisition of insight first in january  we now will be able to provide a more comprehensive suite of integrated marketing solutions that includes audience management and web analytics tools 
our aim is to remain the leading gateway to the full spectrum of technology driven solutions for interactive marketing 
critical accounting policies general the consolidated financial statements of the company are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  the company is required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that management believes are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
the significant accounting policies which the company believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the reported consolidated financial results include the following revenue recognition integrated media solutions web alliance revenues are generated by delivering advertising impressions for a fixed fee to third party web sites 
website results revenues are derived from driving traffic to a client web sites 
email related revenues are derived from delivering advertisements to email lists for advertisers and web sites 
agreements are primarily short term and revenues are recognized as services are delivered provided that no significant company obligations remain outstanding and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
technology solutions our technology solutions revenues are derived from licensing our software  ad serving  and maintenance and technical support contracts 
revenue from software licensing agreements is recognized in accordance with statements of position sop  software revenue recognition  and staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements upon delivery of the software  which is generally when the software is made available for download  there is pervasive evidence of an arrangement  collection is reasonably assured  the fee is fixed or determinable  and vendor specific objective evidence exists to allocate the total fees to all elements of the arrangement 
revenue from ad serving is recognized as services are delivered 
the contracts are usually for a one year period and are billed on a monthly basis 
revenue from maintenance and technical support contracts is recognized ratably over the life of the maintenance agreements  which typically do not exceed one year 
maintenance and technical support revenue invoiced in advance of the related services is recorded as deferred revenue 
expense from the company s licensing  maintenance and technical support revenues are primarily payroll costs incurred to deliver and support the software 
these expenses are classified as cost of revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
in  the company changed to a subscription based contract model for new customers of our oas local software 
total contract value will be recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
this will have a modest negative impact on  but any impact will be recaptured in subsequent years 
accounts receivable we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by a review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that have been experienced in the past 
impairment of long lived assets effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets and sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived asset 
sfas eliminates the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  addresses the amortization of intangible assets with finite lives and addresses impairment testing and recognition for goodwill and intangible assets 
sfas no 
establishes a single model for the impairment of long lived assets 
we assess goodwill for impairment annually unless events occur that require more frequent reviews 
long lived assets  including amortizable intangibles  are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
discounted cash flow analyses are used to assess nonamortizable intangible impairment while undiscounted cash flow analyses are used to assess long lived asset impairment 
if an assessment indicates impairment  the impaired asset is written down to its fair market value based on the best information available 
estimated fair market value is generally measured with discounted estimated future cash flows 
considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate undiscounted and discounted future cash flows 
assumptions used for these cash flows are consistent with internal forecasts 
on an on going basis  management reviews the value and period of amortization or depreciation of long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangible assets 
during this review  we reevaluate the significant assumptions used in determining the original cost of long lived assets 
although the assumptions may vary from transaction to transaction  they generally include revenue growth  operating results  cash flows and other indicators of value 
management then determines whether there has been an impairment of the value of long lived assets based upon events or circumstances  which have occurred since acquisition 
the impairment policy is consistently applied in evaluating impairment for each of the company s wholly owned subsidiaries and investments 
investments we record an impairment charge when we believe an asset has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
contingencies and litigation we evaluate contingent liabilities including threatened or pending litigation in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies and record accruals when the outcome of these matters is deemed probable and the liability is reasonably estimable 
we make these assessments based on the facts and circumstances and in some instances based in part on the advice of outside legal counsel 
restructuring activities restructuring activities in are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
prior to  restructuring activities are accounted for in accordance with the guidance provided in the consensus opinion of the emerging issues task force eitf in connection with eitf issue eitf 
eitf generally requires  with respect to the recognition of severance expenses  management approval of the restructuring plan  the determination of the employees to be terminated  and communication of benefit arrangement to employees 
results of operations compared to factors affecting comparability of to on october   we acquired real media 
this accounted for million of revenue in the fourth quarter of  which was equally derived from the integrated media solutions and technology solutions segments 
the merger created cost synergies for our combined company  one of which was to focus on real media s proprietary open adstream technology and to abandon our existing ad serving technology  connect 
the transition of the web alliance business onto the open adstream platform began in december and was completed in february resulting in the elimination of redundant personnel and operating costs associated with having two ad serving platforms 
throughout and into  in accordance with our business plan  we acquired  divested or discontinued many of our non core assets  including in may  we completed the sale of certain technology assets and intellectual property of sabela and completed the shut down of sabela operations on june  in may  we completed the sale of exactis  our email service bureau 
in august  the operations of europe were shut down and our consolidated financial statements have been revised to reflect this international segment as a discontinued operation 
in january  we completed the sale of our imake subsidiary 
the financial statements of prior periods have been revised to reflect the disposition of imake as a discontinued operation 
in may  we completed the sale of certain assets related to our us email management product 
the revenue attributed to the disposition of these non core assets for the year ended december  and december  was approximately million and million  respectively  not including approximately million in that is included as part of discontinued operations 
our technology solutions segment is not comparable between periods as the revenue in is derived solely from operations that were acquired with real media in october   while the revenue in primarily relates to operations that have been sold or shut down  including exactis and sabela 
as a result of our cost cutting and divestiture efforts  which began in november through december   we significantly reduced our headcount and closed several offices  both domestic and international 
the core elements of our business that remain are the web alliance a global alliance of web sites where advertisers can place a global ad campaign or geographically select regions of the world to target  website results performance based search marketing services  and open adstream advertising delivery and management for web sites  ad agencies  and advertisers 
on september   we acquired certain assets of vflash d b a now marketing  however  this did not contribute significantly to revenue

revenue is derived from three sources web alliance  website results and other services 
web alliance generated million in revenue in compared to million in  a decrease of 
the decrease is due to the difficult environment for advertising  especially digital marketing  as well as a planned temporary reduction in capacity as we transitioned from the more costly connect to open adstream technology in the first quarter of in october  we acquired real media  which represented approximately million in web alliance revenue in in the beginning of  the web alliance operations of real media in the us were combined with the operations of media  so that a meaningful year over year comparison cannot be made  although the media operations of real media in the united states were not significant 
the international operations of real media for the two months that real media was included in represented approximately million of web alliance revenue  compared to the full year total of million in website results revenue increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
this is due to an increase in the number of clicks delivered to our client web sites as a result of expanding our strategic relationship with traffic providers and increasing the number of traffic providers 
the average cpc per customer has remained consistent year over year despite a slight trend down in the industry  however  the weighted average cpc has decreased as larger advertisers  who generally receive lower price due to volume  are providing more of the revenue 
other services revenue is generated primarily from e mail and ipromotions 
e mail revenue decreased from million in to million in due to our strategic decision to exit the e mail business 
we sold the us email management product  known as mail  to naviant on may  we maintain the ability to sell e mail domestically as a broker through naviant s mail and internationally without restriction 
in january  we sold our ipromotions unit  which accounted for million revenue in and million in technology solutions 
technology revenue of million in is solely related to operations that were acquired with real media and are generated from our open adstream platform 
revenue from our products that we host  including oas central and oad  continued to grow during as impressions delivered climbed from billion in the first quarter to billion in the fourth quarter 
the million in revenue in consists of million from exactis  which was sold in may  million from sabela  which was sold in may  and million from real media  which was acquired in october and whose results were included for two months 
cost of revenue and gross profit integrated media solutions cost of revenues and gross profit 
the cost of revenues consists primarily of fees paid to affiliates  whether it is a web site for web alliance  a list provider for e mail or a traffic provider for website results  which are usually calculated as a percentage of revenues 
cost of revenue also includes depreciation of our connect ad serving system in and bandwidth costs 
in  the actual costs associated with ad serving were accounted for in the cost of revenues for the technology solutions segment which then charged the integrated media solutions segment a cpm  making these costs variable instead of fixed as they were previously accounted for when we used connect 
gross margin increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the increase in margin is due to lower ad serving costs in as fixed costs of connect were a substantial percentage of our revenue  which adversely affected the gross margin  additionally  the royalty percentages paid to web alliance affiliate is trending lower 
excluding the us email product  the margins were and for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
technology cost of revenues and gross profit 
the cost of technology revenues consists of the cost of operating equipment and broadband capacity for our third party ad serving solutions and payroll costs to support software  offset by the portion allocated to the integrated media solutions segment for ad serving 
gross margin increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  as noted above  the periods are not comparable  as the segment is comprised of almost entirely different operations 
operating expenses 
each of sales and marketing  general and administrative  product development and amortization expense decreased significantly in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  as a result of our restructuring activities  the decision to exit latin america and the sales of sabela  exactis and certain assets related to the us email management product 
the decreases were partially offset by the acquisition of real media 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of sales force salaries and commissions  advertising expenditures and costs of trade shows  conventions and marketing materials 
sales and marketing expenses decreased as a percentage of revenue from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  as result of our rationalization efforts 
rationalization efforts decreased headcount by approximately and approximately employees were transferred to naviant  leaving approximately sales and marketing employees at december  general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation  facilities expenses and other overhead expenses incurred to support the business 
general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of revenue from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the significant decrease is due to our reductions of headcount  office space  professional fees and related expenses 
as the economy deteriorated in  we accrued significant bad debt reserves  however  positive collection efforts in have reduced the required reserves  therefore  we enjoyed a net benefit from bad debt expense reversals for the year of approximately million 
rationalization efforts reduced headcount by approximately employees during  leaving approximately general and administrative employees at december  product development expenses 
product development expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs incurred to further enhance our ad serving and other technology capabilities 
product development expenses decreased as a percentage of revenue from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the decrease is due to the sale of exactis on whose technology we spent significant amounts and our focus on oas which requires less enhancements than connect 
also  the expense decreased in as costs related to developing our open advertiser product were capitalized 
we capitalized approximately million during and will continue to capitalize costs until oad is ready for general release  which is expected during the summer of product development headcount was reduced by approximately employees during  leaving approximately at december  amortization of goodwill  intangibles and advances 
amortization expense is broken down as follows acquisition reason for change real media  acquired october  website results  sfas  impairment now marketing assets acquired september  consumernet mail  sfas  sold may  canada  sfas exactis impairment  sold may  sfas no 
states that goodwill is no longer amortized as of january   the adoption of which reduced amortization expense by approximately million 
the remaining decrease is due to the disposition of assets and the impairment of intangible assets on website results 
our net loss attributable to common stockholders for  excluding goodwill amortization would have been million or per share 
the amortization expense and net loss from operations for the year ended december and had sfas no 
been applied for these periods is as follows for the year ended december  in thousands net loss attributable to common stockholders   add back goodwill amortization   adjusted net loss attributable to commons stockholders  basic and diluted net loss per share net loss per share attributable to common shareholders add back goodwill amortization adjusted net loss per share attributable to common shareholders although sfas no 
requires disclosure of these amounts to reflect the impact of adoption on and results  there can be no assurance that this would not have resulted in additional impairment charges in each of the respective years 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation of million for the year ended december  consists of million in stock and options grants to executives for restructuring their employment agreements  million in contractual bonuses that will be paid in stock in lieu of cash to executives for meeting certain earnings targets  million in amortization of deferred compensation for restricted shares issued to certain employees  million in compensation to board members and bonuses to employees paid in stock  million in salary for employees who elected to receive stock instead of cash  and million in amortization of deferred compensation from acquisitions 
the million for the year ended december  consists of million in amortization of deferred compensation for restricted shares issued to certain employees and million in amortization of deferred compensation from acquisitions 
restructuring costs 
during the years ended december  and  restructuring charges of approximately million and million  respectively  were recorded in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
in and eitf  and staff accounting bulletin sab no 
in 
our restructuring initiatives were to reduce employee headcount  consolidate operations and reduce office space in order to better align our sales  development and administrative organization and to position us for profitable growth consistent with our long term objectives 
the restructuring involved the involuntary termination of approximately employees  the exiting of four offices  and a reduction of space at offices in the fourth quarter of the million charge consists of severance of million  office closing costs of million  disposal of fixed assets of million  and other exit costs of million offset by a million reduction in deferred rent 
the restructuring involved the involuntary termination of approximately employees  the exiting of two offices  a reduction of space at two additional offices  and the abandonment of our connect ad serving solution 
the million charge consists of severance of million  acceleration of restricted stock grants of million  office closing costs of million  disposal of fixed assets related to offices of million  disposal of fixed assets related to connect of million  and other exit costs of million primarily related to contracts for connect offset by a reversal of million of unutilized reserve resulting from the sale of exactis 
the restructuring includes non cash charges of approximately million 
loss gain on sale of assets 
the million loss for the year ended december  includes a million loss on the sale of certain assets related to our us email management product offset by a million gain related to the sales of exactis in may as part of the sale of exactis  there were approximately million in deferred gains related to an escrow balance and million in deferred gains related to prepaid service amounts 
the gains are recognized as the escrow balance is released and the prepaid services are utilized 
during the first quarter of  we agreed to pay experian  the acquirer of exactis  million of the escrow balance  with the remainder paid to the company immediately 
therefore  million of the deferred gain was recognized and million was reversed against the escrow balance 
the remaining gain related to exactis consists of million for use of prepaid services and million from the reversal of unnecessary accruals related to exactis 
the million gain for the year ended december  consisted of a million gain for the sale of intellectual property related to sabela and a million for the sale of the intellectual property related to awardtrack  offset by a loss of million for the sale of exactis 
impairment of intangibles assets 
we perform on going business reviews and  based on quantitative and qualitative measures  assess the need to record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when impairment indicators are present 
where impairment indicators were identified  management determined the amount of the impairment charge by comparing the carrying values of goodwill and other long lived assets to their fair values 
through august  we completed numerous acquisitions that were financed principally with shares of our common stock  and were valued based on the price of our common stock at that time 
during the fourth quarter of  we reevaluated the carrying value of our businesses 
our revaluation was triggered by the continued decline in the internet advertising and marketing sectors throughout in addition  each of these entities had experienced declines in operating and financial metrics over the past several quarters  primarily due to the continued weak overall demand of on line advertising and marketing services  in comparison to the metrics forecasted at the time of their respective acquisitions 
these factors significantly impacted current projected revenue generated from these businesses 
our evaluation of impairment was also based on achievement of the unit s business plan objectives and milestones  the fair value of each business unit relative to its carrying value  the financial condition and prospects of each business unit and other relevant factors 
the business plan objectives and milestones that were considered included  among others  those related to financial performance  such as achievement of planned financial results  and other non financial milestones such as successful deployment of technology or launching of new products and the loss of key employees 
the impairment analysis also considered when these properties were acquired and that the intangible assets recorded at the time of acquisition were being amortized over useful lives of years 
the amount of the impairment charge was determined by comparing the carrying value of goodwill and other long lived assets to fair value at each respective period 
where impairment was indicated  we determined the fair value of our business units based on a market approach  which included an analysis of market price multiples of companies engaged in similar businesses 
to the extent that market comparables were not available  we used discounted cash flows in determining the value 
the market price multiples were selected and applied to the business based on the relative performance  future prospects and risk profile of the business in comparison to the guideline companies 
the methodology used to test for and measure the amount of the impairment charge was based on the same methodology used during our initial acquisition valuations 
as a result  during management s review of the value and periods of amortization of both goodwill and certain other intangibles it was determined that the carrying value of goodwill and certain other intangible assets were not recoverable 
the other intangible assets that were determined to be impaired related to the decline in fair market value of acquired technology  a significant reduction in the acquired customer bases and turnover of workforce that was in place at the time of the acquisition of these companies 
as a result  we determined that the fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets attributable to several of our operating units were less than their carrying values 
accordingly  we recognized million in impairment charges to adjust the carrying values in million related to website results  million related to mail and million related to exactis 
there were no impairment charges recorded in the impairment factors evaluated may change in subsequent periods  given that our business operates in a highly volatile business environment 
this could result in significant additional impairment charges in the future 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets and sfas no 
 accounting for impairment of disposal of long lived asset 
sfas eliminates the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  addresses the amortization of intangible assets with finite lives and addresses impairment testing and recognition for goodwill and intangible assets 
sfas establishes a single model for the impairment of long lived assets and broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions 
as required  we had an external valuation of goodwill during for the goodwill that existed at december  we updated this analysis internally for the goodwill that existed at december  neither analysis indicated an impairment of goodwill 
interest income  net 
interest income relates to our cash and cash equivalents and interest expense relates to our notes payable and capital lease obligations 
interest income has decreased due to the decrease in our cash and cash equivalents 
interest expense of million in increased due to an increase in the amount and time outstanding of notes payable 
gain on sales of investments 
the gain on sale of investments in relates to the sale of our remaining available for sale securities and cost based investment in idealab 
impairment of investments 
during  we wrote down certain of our investments and recognized impairment charges of approximately million for other than temporary declines in value of certain investments 
we made an assessment of the carrying value of our cost based investments and determined that they were in excess of their carrying values due to the significance and duration of the decline in valuations of comparable companies operating in the internet and technology sectors 
the write down of cost based investments was million related to media asia 
we also recognized that the decline in value of our available for sale investments in network commerce and imobile were other than temporary and recorded an impairment of million and million  respectively 
other income 
other income consists of amounts received for licensing our patents  net of legal expenses 
loss from discontinued operations 
on august   we determined that we would cease funding to our european subsidiaries and communicated that to europe nv s board of directors 
management of europe shut down all operations 
approximately million of the loss from discontinued operations in related to europe 
all revenue  cost and expenses related to the discontinued business are included in this line for the current period and prior periods have been reclassified to reflect this presentation in accordance with accounting principles board apb no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
on january   we completed the sale of our wholly owned subsidiary  imake 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we accounted for the operations of this component as a discontinued operation 
approximately million of the loss from discontinued operations in related to imake 
our consolidated financial statements have been revised to reflect the sale of the imake subsidiary as a discontinued operation in accordance with sfas no 
dividends on preferred stock 
the series a and series b preferred stock issued during accrue and cumulate dividends at a rate of per year  compounded monthly  payable when  as and if declared by our board of directors 
preferred stock conversion discount 
during the third quarter of  we issued series a and series b preferred stock  which is convertible into common stock at prices of and per share  respectively 
at the time we agreed to the initial terms of the transactions with the third parties  the conversion price of the preferred stock approximated the fair value of our underlying common stock 
from the time the agreements were substantially complete until the transactions closed and all contingencies were resolved eg stockholder approval  the stock price increased to approximately per share for the series a and for the series b 
as a result of the increase in stock price  the preferred stock was issued at a substantial discount to fair market value 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the beneficial conversion feature  calculated as the difference between market value on the date of issuance and the conversion price  is required to be expensed immediately  however  the discount was limited to the amount of cash allocable to each of the preferred stock transactions 
accordingly  we recorded a non cash charge of million for the series a preferred stock and million for the series b preferred stock for a total charge of million 
results of operations compared to factors affecting comparability of to on october   we acquired real media 
this accounted for million of revenue in the fourth quarter of  which was equally derived from the integrated media solutions and technology solutions segments 
the merger created cost synergies for our combined company  one of which was to focus on real media s proprietary open adstream technology and abandon our existing ad serving technology  connect 
the transition of the network business onto the open adstream platform began in december and was completed in february resulting in the elimination of redundant personnel and operating costs associated with having two ad serving platforms 
throughout  in accordance with our business plan  we divested or discontinued many of our non core assets  including in may  we completed the sale of certain technology assets and intellectual property of sabela and completed the shut down of sabela operations on june  in may  we completed the sale of exactis  our email service bureau

revenues integrated media solutions 
our integrated media solutions revenues decreased million  or to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease in revenue was due to a dramatic decrease in advertising dollars spent as the economy continued to deteriorate throughout as a result of the economic recession and the events of september  online advertising was especially hard hit due to the collapse of the dot com companies  which were a significant customer base and as the advertising dollars available went toward traditional media 
revenue was only slightly impacted by our decision to exit the awardtrack product line and the latin american market  which accounted for approximately million or of our overall decrease 
the declines in revenue were partially offset by our merger with real media on october  which added million or and the inclusion of website results for a full year in as compared to only four months in  which added million 
website results also moved to a revenue share model with several strategic partners in order to provide higher quality  more targeted traffic to their clients

the cost of revenues consists primarily of fees paid to affiliated web sites  which are calculated as a percentage of revenues resulting from ads delivered  list providers and traffic providers  depreciation of our connect ad serving system  and internet access costs 
gross margin declined from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the decline in margin is due to the decrease in volume  which is unable to support the fixed costs associated with connect and a shift in the business model of the website results to a lower margin product 
in the future  cost associated with ad serving will be accounted for in the technology solutions segment cost of revenues and an allocation based on usage will be reflected in the integrated media solutions cost of revenues  making these costs variable versus fixed as they were under connect 
technology cost of revenues and gross profit 
the cost of technology revenues consists of time and materials for consulting contracts  the cost of equipment and broadband for our third party adserving solutions and primarily payroll costs to deliver  modify and support software 
gross margin increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the slight increase is due to a change in the mix of revenue toward higher margin products 
impacting the margin was the sale of exactis acquired in june and sold in may whose product had a high gross margin which was offset by the addition of our open adstream product acquired with real media included for two months of operating expenses 
each of sales and marketing  general and administrative  product development and amortization expenses decreased significantly in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  as a result of our restructuring activities  the decisions to discontinue the awardtrack product and exit latin america april and the sale of sabela and exactis

in addition  amortization expense decreased significantly from principally due to the significant impairment charge related to goodwill and other intangible assets taken in the fourth quarter of and throughout while operating expenses decreased in dollar terms  they increased as a percentage of revenue

impairment of intangibles assets 
we perform on going business reviews and  based on quantitative and qualitative measures  assess the need to record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when impairment indicators are present 
where impairment indicators were identified  management determined the amount of the impairment charge by comparing the carrying values of goodwill and other long lived assets to their fair values 
through august  we completed numerous acquisitions that were financed principally with shares of our common stock  and were valued based on the price of our common stock at that time 
during the fourth quarter of  we reevaluated the carrying value of our businesses 
our revaluation was triggered by the continued decline in the internet advertising and marketing sectors throughout in addition  each of these entities had experienced declines in operating and financial metrics over the past several quarters  primarily due to the continued weak overall demand of on line advertising and marketing services  in comparison to the metrics forecasted at the time of their respective acquisitions 
these factors significantly impacted current projected revenue generated from these businesses 
our evaluation of impairment was also based on achievement of the unit s business plan objectives and milestones  the fair value of each business unit relative to its carrying value  the financial condition and prospects of each business unit and other relevant factors 
the business plan objectives and milestones that were considered included  among others  those related to financial performance  such as achievement of planned financial results  and other non financial milestones such as successful deployment of technology or launching of new products and the loss of key employees 
the impairment analysis also considered when these properties were acquired and that the intangible assets recorded at the time of acquisition were being amortized over useful lives of years 
the amount of the impairment charge was determined by comparing the carrying value of goodwill and other long lived assets to fair value at each respective period 
where impairment was indicated  we determined the fair value of our business units based on a market approach  which included an analysis of market price multiples of companies engaged in similar businesses 
to the extent that market comparables were not available  we used discounted cash flows in determining the value 
the market price multiples were selected and applied to the business based on the relative performance  future prospects and risk profile of the business in comparison to the guideline companies 
the methodology used to test for and measure the amount of the impairment charge was based on the same methodology used during our initial acquisition valuations 
as a result  during management s review of the value and periods of amortization of both goodwill and certain other intangibles it was determined that the carrying value of goodwill and certain other intangible assets were not recoverable 
the other intangible assets that were determined to be impaired related to the decline in fair market value of acquired technology  a significant reduction in the acquired customer bases and turnover of workforce that was in place at the time of the acquisition of these companies 
as a result  we determined that the fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets attributable to several of our operating units were less than their carrying values 
in addition  during  we abandoned operations of our awardtrack subsidiary and entered into negotiations for the sale of our sabela subsidiary 
in january  we sold our imake division 
we recorded sabela s assets at their estimated realizable value at december  and  respectively 
as a result of these actions  we wrote off all remaining goodwill and intangible assets related to awardtrack and sabela 
accordingly  we recognized million and million in impairment charges to adjust the carrying values in and  respectively 
impairments taken were as follows in millions website results consumernet exactis sabela ipromotions awardtrack the impairment factors evaluated may change in subsequent periods  given that our business operates in a highly volatile business environment 
this could result in significant additional impairment charges in the future

impairment of investments 
during  the company wrote down certain of its investments and recognized impairment charges of approximately million for other than temporary declines in value of certain investments

these amounts consist primarily of severance and rent exit costs  which are being paid ratably 
we expect to pay approximately million in and million in no provision for federal or state income taxes has been recorded because we incurred net operating losses for all periods presented 
at december   we had approximately million of us net operating loss carryforwards 
our net operating loss carryforwards expire in various years through as a result of various equity transactions during the past five years  we believe that our company has undergone an ownership change as defined by section of the internal revenue code 
accordingly  the utilization of a substantial part of the net operating loss carryforward is limited 
due to our history of operating losses and the section limitation  there is substantial uncertainty surrounding whether we will ultimately realize our deferred tax assets 
accordingly  these assets have been fully reserved 
during and  the valuation allowance decreased by million and increased by million  respectively

with the acquisition of real media  inc in october  the company assumed a note payable of million payable to publigroupe  which at the time of the merger became an approximately shareholder 
the note bears interest at and principal and interest are due on october  in addition  in accordance with the real media purchase agreement in january  the company received cash of million and signed a promissory note payable to publigroupe bearing interest at  with interest and principal due in january we achieved certain target operating results for the three months ended march  and as result  on may   we received another million from publigroupe in exchange for a three year promissory note with interest and principal due in may on january   we completed the sale of our wholly owned subsidiary  imake to schaszberger corporation 
under the terms of the sale  the purchase price payable was approximately million for the stock of imake  of which million was in the form of a four year secured note  approximately million in cash consideration  and a potential earnout of up to million over the next three years based on gross revenue 
additionally  we received series a preferred stock of schaszberger corp which  as of the closing date is convertible into common stock amounting to of the capital stock of the buyer 
the note is secured by certain assets of imake and is guaranteed by schaszberger corporation 
we discounted the note receivable to million and recorded million as the net present value of the earnout based on our estimates of projected revenues 
in january  we received the upfront cash consideration of million 
during  we collected million from imake and reflected the remaining balance as million and million in short and long term  respectively  notes and amounts receivable from disposition at december  on may   we completed the sale of certain assets related to our us email management product  including customer contracts  certain intangibles and employee relationships  to mail  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of naviant  inc under the terms of the sale  the purchase price payable was up to million of which million was paid at closing and million was deferred or subject to an earn out provision 
on july   we received a letter from naviant alleging the breach of certain of our warranties with respect to the assets sold to naviant 
on october   the parties agreed to resolve the dispute through immediate payment of million by naviant to us in lieu of all future amounts that naviant may owe us 
as result of the settlement  we wrote off approximately million of the remaining amount due from naviant in the third quarter of we received the million on october  on july   we entered into a series a and series a preferred stock and common stock warrant purchase agreement with sunra capital holdings limited sunra  a newly formed investment fund advised by merchant s group international 
on july   sunra purchased million of our newly created series a preferred stock  and million of our newly created series a non voting convertible preferred stock  and on august  sunra and affiliated parties agreed  subject to stockholder approval  to purchase an additional million of the series a preferred stock  for a total investment of million 
upon receipt of stockholder approval on september   the outstanding shares of series a preferred stock converted into shares of series a preferred stock and sunra consummated the purchase of an additional million of the series a preferred stock the september  series a preferred stock transactions 
each share of series a preferred stock is convertible into our common stock at any time at the option of the holder thereof at a conversion price of per share of common stock  or  shares of common stock on an as if converted basis 
we also issued warrants to sunra to purchase a total of  shares of common stock at an exercise price of 
all of the warrants issued may be exercised through a cashless exercise and have a five year term 
sunra and affiliated parties are the beneficial owner of approximately  shares of our common stock 
we also issued  warrants to merchant s group international as partial payment of a placement fee and incurred transaction costs of approximately million 
the series a preferred stock accrues and cumulates dividends at the rate of per year  compounded monthly  payable when  as and if declared by our board of directors 
accordingly  the undeclared cumulative dividends of million are reflected as preferred stock dividends on the consolidated statement of operations 
the july  and september  series a preferred stock transactions contained embedded beneficial conversion features that were required to be valued separately 
we allocated the proceeds received in each of the transactions to the series a preferred stock and detachable warrants based on a relative fair value basis 
the intrinsic value of the beneficial conversion feature associated with the july  series a preferred stock transaction was approximately million 
the intrinsic value of the beneficial conversion feature associated with the september  series a preferred stock transactions was calculated as the difference between the conversion price of per share of common stock and the fair value of the common stock into which the series a preferred stock was convertible into on the stockholder approval date of per share  or an intrinsic value of approximately per share  which was greater than the proceeds allocated to the september  series a preferred stock transactions 
accordingly  the amount of the discount was limited to the amount of cash allocable to the september  series a preferred stock transactions 
therefore  we recorded a non cash charge of million in the third quarter of  which is included in the preferred stock conversion discount on the consolidated statement of operations  similar to a preferred stock dividend 
in conjunction with the sunra investment  four executive officers each agreed to modify their respective employment agreements with us to reduce the amount of severance payable to such executive officers by  which would be payable in one lump sum  and to reduce the notice period for termination or non renewal from days to days 
in exchange  such executives received  in the aggregate  approximately million shares of our common stock of which the initial conversion value was based on the approximate fair market value of our common stock as of the date of the sunra investment  or per share  in consideration of approximately million  out of a total of approximately million  future severance benefits forfeited 
in addition  such executives would also received fully vested stock options to acquire approximately million shares of our common stock with an exercise price of per share 
the issuance of the shares and options were subject to stockholder approval of the stock incentive plan and the sunra series a preferred stock transactions 
for accounting purposes  the shares and options are being valued at per share  based on their fair market value using the closing price of our common stock on the stockholder approval date  september  in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock based compensation  this approval resulted in a non cash stock based compensation charge of approximately million in the aggregate 
the compensation charge related to the options is based on their intrinsic value of per option  that is  the fair market value of our common stock on the shareholder approval date of per share less the exercise price of per share  which resulted in million of the million charge 
in addition  the four executive officers agreed to receive the earnings before interest  taxes and amortization ebita portion of their target bonus  if earned  in shares of our common stock 
the number of shares to be issued in connection with the award is based upon the ebita portion of their target bonus award divided by per share 
accordingly  this modification to the executives bonus award resulted in a variable based compensation award which is required to be measured based upon the fair market value of our common stock at each reporting period  namely at the end of the third and fourth quarter of at december   management determined that it was probable that the ebita target would be met and determined  at per share  that the bonus equates to approximately million common shares 
accordingly  the four executives bonus awards resulted in a non cash stock based compensation charge of approximately million based upon the fair market value of our common stock of per share as of the end of the reporting period 
on september   we acquired certain assets of elbit vflash inc and elbit vflash ltd 
d b a now marketing now marketing  a new york based marketing services firm 
the acquisition agreement required now marketing s ultimate parent  elron electronic industries ltd 
and gilbridge  inc  together now marketing s parent  to make a million investment in our company in exchange for  shares of series b preferred stock 
accordingly  the total purchase consideration of million consists of million shares of common stock valued at million   shares of series b preferred stock valued at million and  of transaction costs 
the series b preferred stock is convertible into shares of our common stock at any time at the option of the holder thereof at a conversion price of per share  or  shares of common stock on an as if converted basis 
the excess purchase price excluding the million series b preferred stock discount over the fair market value of net tangible assets of approximately million has been allocated to acquired technology and is being amortized over the expected period of benefit of four years

 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas no 
which nullifies emerging issues task force issue no 
eitf  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit activity or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under eits  a liability for an exit cost as defined in eitf was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  the adoption may affect the timing of the recognition of future exit and disposal costs 
implementation of this new standard has no material effect on our financial statements 
stock based compensation 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas no 
which amends statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 

sfas no 
provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntarily change to fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and also requires more prominent and more frequent disclosures in the financial statements of the effects of stock based compensation 
the provisions of sfas are effective for fiscal years ending after december  and interim disclosure provisions are effective for interim periods beginning after december  the company has compiled with the disclosure provisions of this standard 
revenue arrangements 
in november  the fasb emerging issues task force reached a consensus on issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
eitf addresses the issues of how to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting and how arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate units of accounting in the arrangement 
the eitf will be effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the company has not yet determined the impact of the adoption of eitf will have on the company s financial position and results of operations 
additional factors that may affect our business  future operating results and financial condition risks related to real media  inc 
we anticipate continued losses and we may never be profitable 
we have not achieved profitability in any period and we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability in the future 
we incurred net losses of million and million for the months ended december  and  respectively 
each of our predecessors had net losses in every year of their operation 
we may incur operating losses for the foreseeable future 
even if we do achieve profitability  we may not sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
we may need to raise additional funds to continue operations 
while management believes the company s current financial resources are sufficient to fund our operations for the next twelve months  an unforeseen reduction in our revenues  an impairment of our receivables  or an increase in expenses may require us to raise additional funds to continue operations 
to the extent we encounter additional opportunities to raise cash  we may sell additional equity or debt securities  which would result in further dilution of our stockholders 
stockholders may experience extreme dilution due to our current stock price and the amount of financing we may need to raise and these securities may have rights senior to those of holders of our common stock 
we do not have any contractual restrictions on our ability to incur debt 
any indebtedness could contain covenants  which restrict our operations 
we have limited access to the capital markets to raise capital 
the capital markets have been unpredictable in the past  especially for unprofitable companies such as ours 
in addition  it is difficult to raise capital in the current market conditions 
the amount of capital that a company such as ours is able to raise often depends on variables that are beyond our control  such as the share price of our stock and its trading volume 
as a result  there is no guarantee that efforts to secure financing on terms attractive to us will be successful  or that we will be able to secure additional financing on any terms 
due to our operating losses  it may be difficult to obtain debt financing 
if we are able to consummate a financing arrangement  there is no guarantee that the amount raised will be sufficient to meet our future needs 
if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms  or at all  our business  results of operation  financial condition and continued viability will be materially and adversely affected 
we have a limited operating history on which an investor can evaluate our business 
we have a limited operating history 
you must consider the risks  expenses and difficulties typically encountered by companies with limited operating histories  particularly companies in new and rapidly expanding markets such as internet advertising 
these risks include our ability to develop new relationships and maintain existing relationships with our web sites  advertisers  and other third parties  further develop and upgrade our technology  respond to competitive developments  implement and improve operational  financial and management information systems  and attract  retain and motivate qualified employees 
at times in the past and in certain segments  our revenues have grown significantly 
our limited operating history makes prediction of future revenue growth difficult 
accurate predictions of future revenue growth are also difficult because of the rapid changes in our markets and the possible need by us to sell assets to fund operations 
accordingly  investors should not rely on past revenue growth rates as a prediction of future revenue growth 
our future revenues and results of operations may be difficult to forecast and results in prior periods may not be indicative of future results 
our results of operations have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include the addition of new or loss of existing clients  changes in fees paid by advertisers and direct marketers or other clients  changes in service fees payable by us to owners of web sites or email lists  or ad serving fees payable by us to third parties  the demand by advertisers  web publishers and direct marketers for our advertising solutions  the introduction of new internet marketing services by us or our competitors  variations in the levels of capital or operating expenditures and other costs relating to the maintenance or expansion of our operations  including personnel costs  changes in governmental regulation of the internet  and general economic conditions 
our future revenues and results of operations may be difficult to forecast due to the above factors 
in addition  our expense levels are based in large part on our investment plans and estimates of future revenues 
any increased expenses may precede or may not be followed by increased revenues  as we may be unable to  or may elect not to  adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall 
as a result  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful 
you should not rely on past periods as indicators of future performance 
in future periods  our results of operations may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors  which could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
we disclose pro forma information we prepare and release quarterly unaudited financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
we also disclose and discuss certain pro forma information in the related earnings release and investor conference call 
this pro forma financial information excludes or may exclude certain special charges and other costs 
we believe the disclosure of the pro forma financial information helps investors more meaningfully evaluate the results of our ongoing operations 
however  we urge investors to carefully review the gaap financial information included as part of our quarterly reports on form q  our annual reports on form k  and our quarterly earnings releases  and to compare the gaap financial information with the pro forma financial results disclosed in our quarterly earnings releases and investor calls 
recently enacted and proposed changes in securities laws and regulations are likely to increase our costs 
the sarbanes oxley act of that became law in july requires changes in some of our corporate governance and securities disclosure or compliance practices 
that act also requires the sec to promulgate new rules on a variety of subjects  in addition to rule proposals already made  and nasdaq has proposed revisions to its requirements for companies that are nasdaq listed 
we expect these developments to increase our legal compliance costs 
we expect these developments to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance  and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage 
these developments could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors  or qualified executive officers 
we are presently evaluating and monitoring regulatory developments and cannot estimate the timing or magnitude of additional costs we may incur as a result 
our business may suffer if we are unable to successfully implement our business model a significant part of our business model is to generate revenue by providing interactive marketing solutions to advertisers  ad agencies and web publishers 
the profit potential for this business model is unproven 
to be successful  both internet advertising and our solutions will need to achieve broad market acceptance by advertisers  ad agencies and web publishers 
our ability to generate significant revenue from advertisers will depend  in part  on our ability to contract with web publishers that have web sites with adequate available ad space inventory 
further  these web sites must generate sufficient user traffic with demographic characteristics attractive to our advertisers 
the intense competition among internet advertising sellers has led to the creation of a number of pricing alternatives for internet advertising 
these alternatives make it difficult for us to project future levels of advertising revenue and applicable gross margin that can be sustained by us or the internet advertising industry in general 
intensive marketing and sales efforts may be necessary to educate prospective advertisers regarding the uses and benefits of  and to generate demand for  our products and services  including our newer products and services such as website results 
enterprises may be reluctant or slow to adopt a new approach that may replace  limit or compete with their existing direct marketing systems 
in addition  since online direct marketing is emerging as a new and distinct business apart from online advertising  potential adopters of online direct marketing services will increasingly demand functionality tailored to their specific requirements 
we may be unable to meet the demands of these clients 
acceptance of our new solutions will depend on the continued emergence of internet commerce  communication and advertising  and demand for its solutions 
we cannot assure you that demand for its new solutions will emerge or become sustainable 
we have grown our business through acquisition 
we were formed in february to consolidate three internet advertising companies and have since acquired thirteen more companies 
in combining these entities  we have faced risks and continue to face risks of integrating and improving our financial and management controls  ad serving technology  reporting systems and procedures  and expanding  training and managing our work force 
this process of integration may take a significant period of time and will require the dedication of management and other resources  which may distract management s attention from our other operations 
we may continue pursuing selective acquisitions of businesses  technologies and product lines as a key component of our growth strategy 
any future acquisition or investment may result in the use of significant amounts of cash  potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  incurrence of debt and amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets 
in addition  acquisitions involve numerous risks  including the difficulties in the integration and assimilation of the operations  technologies  products and personnel of an acquired business  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  the availability of favorable acquisition financing for future acquisitions  and the potential loss of key employees of any acquired business 
our inability to successfully integrate any acquired company could adversely affect our business 
the success of our website results operations depend on a small number of search engine affiliates for a significant portion of our website results revenue  the loss of a single search engine affiliate could result in a substantial decrease in our website results revenue 
we have generated a significant portion of our website results revenue from relationships with a limited number of search engines  including inktomi  alta vista  look smart and yellow pages 
com 
we expect that a small number of search engine affiliates will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
we derive most of our search engine traffic from our arrangement with inktomi  our principal search engine partner  which accounted for approximately million of website results revenue in and approximately of our total revenue in similar to our relationships with our other search engine partners  our relationship with inktomi may be cancelled by either party upon thirty days notice 
the loss of any of our principal search engine relationships  and  in particular  our relationship with inktomi  could cause a significant decrease in website results revenue and our total revenue 
in addition  our search engine affiliates operate in industries that experience consolidation from time to time  which could reduce the number of our existing and potential affiliates 
lastly  our search engine affiliates could internally develop or acquire capabilities similar to our service and thus terminate their relationship with us 
our financial condition may affect our ability to enter into new business relationships 
our financial condition may negatively affect our business partners and other market participants perception of our company 
if we are unable to maintain existing relationships and develop new ones  our revenues could suffer materially 
our financial performance and reduction of our workforce may affect the morale and performance of our personnel 
we have incurred significant net losses since our inception 
in an effort to reduce our cash expenses  we have implemented certain restructuring initiatives and headcount and other cost reductions 
in addition  trading levels of our common stock have decreased the value of the stock options granted to employees pursuant to our stock option plan 
as a result of these factors  our remaining personnel may seek employment with larger  more stable companies they perceive to have better prospects 
our failure to retain qualified employees to fulfill our current and future needs could impair our future growth and have a material adverse effect on our business 
if we lose our ceo or other senior managers our business will be adversely effected 
our success depends  to a significant extent  upon our senior management and key sales and technical personnel  particularly david j 
moore  chief executive officer 
the loss of the services of one or more of these persons could materially and adversely affect our ability to develop our business 
our success also depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified technical  sales and marketing  customer support  financial and accounting  and managerial personnel 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to retain our key personnel or that we can attract  integrate or retain other highly qualified personnel in the future 
we have experienced in the past  and may continue to experience in the future  difficulty in hiring and retaining candidates with appropriate qualifications  especially in sales and marketing positions 
our customers and partners may experience adverse business conditions that could adversely affect our business 
as a result of unfavorable conditions in the public equity markets  some of our customers may have difficulty raising sufficient capital to support their long term operations 
as a result  these customers have reduced their spending on internet advertising  which has materially and adversely affected our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  from time to time  we have entered into strategic business relationships with other companies  the nature of which varies  but generally in the context of customer relationships 
these companies may experience similar adverse business conditions that may render them unable to meet our expectations for the strategic business relationship or to fulfill their contractual obligations to us 
such an event could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our technology solutions may not be successful and may cause business disruption 
oas is our proprietary next generation ad serving technology that is intended to serve as our sole ad serving solution 
we must  among other things  ensure that this technology will function efficiently at high volumes  interact properly with our database  offer the functionality demanded by our customers and assimilate our sales and reporting functions 
this development effort could fail technologically or could take more time than expected 
customers may become dissatisfied by any system failure that interrupts our ability to provide our services to them  including failures affecting our ability to deliver advertisements without significant delay to the viewer 
sustained or repeated system failures would reduce the attractiveness of our solutions to advertisers  ad agencies and web publishers and result in contract terminations  fee rebates and make goods  thereby reducing revenue 
slower response time or system failures may also result from straining the capacity of our deployed software or hardware due to an increase in the volume of advertising delivered through our servers 
to the extent that we do not effectively address any capacity constraints or system failures  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
we might experience significant defects in our products software products frequently contain errors or failures  especially when first introduced or when new versions are released 
we might experience significant errors or failures in our products  or they might not work with other hardware or software as expected  which could delay the enhancement of our products  or which could adversely affect market acceptance of our products 
any significant product errors or design flaws would slow the adoption of our products and cause damage to our reputation  which would seriously harm our business 
if customers were dissatisfied with product functionality or performance  we could lose revenue or be subject to liability for service or warranty costs and claims  and our business  operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 
certain software is licensed from third parties some of our products  including one or more modules for our oas platform  contain software licensed from third parties 
some of these licenses may not be available to us in the future or on terms that are acceptable or allow our products to remain competitive 
our inability to use any of this third party software could result in shipment delays  delays in the development of future products or enhancements of existing products  or other disruptions in our business  which could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
our operations are vulnerable to natural disasters and other events  including  terrorist attacks  because we only have limited backup systems 
we have limited backup systems and have experienced system failures and electrical outages from time to time in the past  which have disrupted our operations 
we have a limited disaster recovery plan in the event of damage from fire  floods  typhoons  earthquakes  power loss  telecommunications failures  break ins and similar events 
our operations are dependent on our ability to protect our computer systems against these unexpected adverse events 
if any of the foregoing occurs  we may experience a complete system shutdown 
any business interruption insurance that we carry is unlikely to be sufficient to compensate us for loss of business in the event of a significant catastrophe 
in addition  interruptions in our services could result from the failure of our telecommunications providers to provide the necessary data communications capacity in the time frame we require 
our oas technology resides on computer systems located in our data centers housed by exodus communications in the united states and leve communications in europe 
these systems continuing and uninterrupted performance is critical to our success 
despite precautions that we have taken  unanticipated problems affecting our systems have from time to time in the past caused  and in the future could cause  interruptions in the delivery of our solutions 
our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected by any damage or failure that interrupts or delays our operations 
to improve the performance and to prevent disruption of our services  we may have to make substantial investments to deploy additional servers or one or more copies of our web sites to mirror our online resources 
although we believe we carry property insurance with adequate coverage limits  our coverage may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses  particularly with respect to loss of business and reputation  that may occur 
in addition  terrorist acts or acts of war my cause damage to our employees  facilities  clients  our clients customers  and vendors  which could significantly impact our revenues  costs and expenses and financial position 
the potential for future terrorist attacks  the national and international responses to terrorist attacks or perceived threats to national security  and other acts of war or hostility have created many economic and political uncertainties that could adversely affect our business and results of operations in ways that cannot be presently predicted 
we are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war 
our revenues are subject to seasonal fluctuations 
we believe that our revenues are subject to seasonal fluctuations because advertisers generally place fewer advertisements during the first and third calendar quarters of each year and direct marketers mail substantially more marketing materials in the third quarter each year 
furthermore  internet user traffic typically drops during the summer months  which reduces the number of advertisements to sell and deliver 
expenditures by advertisers and direct marketers tend to vary in cycles that reflect overall economic conditions as well as budgeting and buying patterns 
our revenue could be materially reduced by a decline in the economic prospects of advertisers  direct marketers or the economy in general  which could alter current or prospective advertisers spending priorities or budget cycles or extend our sales cycle 
due to such risks  you should not rely on quarter to quarter comparisons of our results of operations as an indicator of our future results 
our international operations may pose legal and cultural challenges 
we have operations in a number of international markets  including canada  europe and asia 
to date  we have limited experience in marketing  selling and distributing our solutions internationally 
international operations are subject to other risks  including changes in regulatory requirements  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  potentially adverse tax consequences  general import export restrictions relating to encryption technology and or privacy  difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations  political and economic instability  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  and seasonal reductions in business activity during the summer months in europe and certain other parts of the world 
in addition to these factors  due to our minority stake in real media korea in asia  we are relying on our partner to conduct operations  build the network  aggregate web publishers and coordinate sales and marketing efforts 
the success of the network in asia is directly dependent on the success of our partner and its dedication of sufficient resources to our relationship 
our net operating loss carryforwards may be limited 
due to the change in ownership provisions of the internal revenue code  the availability of real media s net operating loss and credit carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation against taxable income in future periods  which could substantially limit the eventual utilization of these carryforwards 
risks related to the market for our common stock 
the low price of our common stock could result in its delisting from the nasdaq smallcap market 
from to  our common stock traded on the nasdaq national market 
under nasdaq rules  our common stock is required to maintain a bid price of at least per share to remain listed on the nasdaq smallcap market 
our common stock has traded below since february however  in october nasdaq suspended the bid price requirement in the aftermath of the september terrorist attacks 
when nasdaq reinstituted the bid price requirement in january  it provided for fresh and extended grace periods 
in order to benefit from the maximum grace period  we transitioned our common stock listing to the nasdaq smallcap market in may nasdaq recently extended the grace periods for companies whose common stock is listed on the nasdaq smallcap market by an additional days  and is seeking the approval of the securities and exchange commission to extend the grace period by up to an additional days 
if our common stock remains below through may   or a later date if the proposed nasdaq rule change is approved by the sec  then we will have to consider steps to regain compliance with nasdaq requirements  including a reverse stock split 
at our annual meeting of stockholders in september  the stockholders of the company granted the board of directors the authority to effect a reverse split of our common stock without further approval from the stockholders of the company  the board may in its discretion approve a reverse split  at one of five ratios between for and for  at any time prior to the next annual meeting of stockholders 
the board has not made any determination as to whether  when and at what ratio it may approve a reverse split 
our failure to meet nasdaq s maintenance criteria may result in the delisting of our common stock from nasdaq 
in such event  trading  if any  in the securities may then continue to be conducted in the non nasdaq over the counter market in what are commonly referred to as the electronic bulletin board and the pink sheets 
as a result  an investor may find it more difficult to dispose of or obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of the securities 
in addition  we would be subject to a rule promulgated by the securities and exchange commission that  if we fail to meet criteria set forth in such rule  imposes various practice requirements on broker dealers who sell securities governed by the rule to persons other than established customers and accredited investors 
for these types of transactions  the broker dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and have received the purchaser s written consent to the transactions prior to sale 
consequently  the rule may have a material adverse effect on the ability of broker dealers to sell the securities  which may materially affect the ability of shareholders to sell the securities in the secondary market 
delisting could make trading our shares more difficult for investors  potentially leading to further declines in share price 
it would also make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital 
we would also incur additional costs under state blue sky laws to sell equity if we are delisted 
we may implement a reverse stock split of our common stock 
our stockholders approved a series of amendments to our certificate of incorporation at our september  stockholders meeting 
these amendments authorized our board of directors to effect a reverse split of all outstanding shares of our common stock at an exchange ratio of either one to  one to  one to  one to or one to at any time prior to the annual meeting of stockholders  the board of directors has the sole discretion to elect  as it determines to be in the best interests of our company and our stockholders  whether or not to effect a reverse stock split  and if so at which of the approved ratios 
if the board of directors elects to implement one of the approved reverse stock splits  the number of issued and outstanding shares of common stock would be reduced in accordance with the exchange ratio for the selected reverse stock split 
the par value of the common stock would remain unchanged at 
per share and the number of authorized shares of common stock would also remain unchanged 
in determining whether or not to implement a reverse stock split  and the appropriate exchange ratio  the board would assess a variety of factors  including but not limited to analysis of our most recent fiscal quarter and general economic conditions  as well as the trading price of our common stock on the days leading up to the date of the reverse stock split 
the effect of any reverse stock split upon the market price of our common stock cannot be predicted  and the history of reverse stock splits for companies in similar circumstances is varied 
the trading price of our common stock may not rise in exact proportion to the reduction in the number of shares of our common stock outstanding as a result of the reverse stock split and there may not be a sustained increase in the trading price of our common stock after giving effect to the reverse stock split 
moreover  the trading price may not remain above the thresholds required by the nasdaq stock market and we may not be able to continue to meet the other continued listing requirements of the nasdaq stock market 
the power of our board of directors to designate and issue shares of preferred stock could have an adverse effect on holders of our common stock 
our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to designate and issue one or more series of preferred stock  having rights and preferences as the board may determine  and any such designations and issuances could have an adverse effect on the rights of holders of common stock 
future sales of our common stock may affect the market price of our common stock 
there were  shares of common stock outstanding as of march   as well as options and warrants to purchase an additional approximately  shares of our common stock 
in addition  there are  shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of our outstanding preferred stock 
we cannot predict the effect  if any  that future sales of common stock  or the availability of shares of common stock for future sale  will have on the market price of our common stock 
sales of substantial amounts of common stock including shares issued upon the exercise of stock options or conversion of shares of preferred stock  or the perception that such sales could occur  may materially and adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock 
sunra  elbit ltd 
and publigroupe collectively hold a majority of the total outstanding voting power of real media and will likely be able to influence certain approval matters and prevent a change of control 
sunra capital holdings ltd 
and affiliated parties are currently the beneficial owner of  shares of our common stock  including shares issuable upon conversion of preferred stock 
elbit ltd 
is currently the beneficial owner of  shares of our common stock  including shares issuable upon conversion of preferred stock 
publigroupe usa holdings is the beneficial owner of  shares of our common stock and has entered into an agreement to vote on all matters in accordance with the recommendations of our board of directors 
additionally  the terms of the series a preferred stock  owned principally by sunra  contain certain protective provisions that provide such holders an effective veto right over certain corporate matters 
based on their voting power  sunra  elbit and publigroupe may effectively be able to determine the outcome of all matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors  amendment of our charter and approval of significant corporate transactions  and will likely be in a position to prevent a change in control of real media even if the other stockholders were in favor of the transaction 
in addition  under certain circumstances  upon the sale  liquidation or dissolution of the company  our series a and series b preferred stockholders may be entitled to receive an aggregate liquidation preference of million  before our common stockholders receive any payment 
after receipt of this payment  the preferred stockholders may also have the right to participate in receiving proceeds payable to common stockholders on an as converted basis 
a a result  in the event of a sale  liquidation or dissolution of the company  including one in which the total proceeds represent a premium to the then prevailing price per share of our common stock  our common stockholders may experience substantial dilution in the amount payable to them  and if the total proceeds are less than or equal to the liquidation preference  then our common stockholders will not receive any proceeds 
effects of anti takeover provisions could inhibit the acquisition of our company 
some of the provisions of our certificate of incorporation  our bylaws and delaware law could  together or separately discourage potential acquisition proposals  delay or prevent a change in control  impede the ability of our stockholders to change the composition of our board of directors in any one year  and limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
high volatility of stock price 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated in the past and may continue to be volatile 
in addition  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
the market prices of the securities of internet related companies have been especially volatile 
investors may be unable to resell their shares of our common stock at or above the purchase price 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company 
many companies in our industry have been subject to this type of litigation in the past 
we may also become involved in this type of litigation 
litigation is often expensive and diverts management s attention and resources  which could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks related to our industry 
our failure to successfully compete may hinder our growth 
the markets for internet advertising and related products and services are intensely competitive and such competition is expected to increase 
our failure to successfully compete may hinder our growth 
we believe that our ability to compete depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control  including the timing and market acceptance of new products and enhancements of existing services developed by us and our competitors  changing demands regarding customer service and support  shifts in sales and marketing efforts by us and our competitors  and the ease of use  performance  price and reliability of our services and products 
many of our competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger customer bases and significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than ours 
in addition  current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase the ability of their products or services to address the needs of our prospective clients 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to successfully compete against current or future competitors 
in addition  the internet must compete for a share of advertisers total budgets with traditional advertising media  such as television  radio  cable and print  as well as content aggregation companies and other companies that facilitate internet advertising 
to the extent that the internet is perceived to be a limited or ineffective advertising or direct marketing medium  advertisers and direct marketers may be reluctant to devote a significant portion of their advertising budgets to internet marketing  which could limit the growth of internet marketing 
our business may not grow if the internet advertising market does not continue to develop 
the internet as a marketing medium has not been in existence for a sufficient period of time to demonstrate its effectiveness 
our business would be adversely affected if the internet advertising continues to remain soft or fails to develop in the near future 
there are currently no widely accepted standards to measure the effectiveness of internet marketing other than clickthrough rates  which generally have been declining 
we cannot be certain that such standards will develop to sufficiently support internet marketing as a significant advertising medium 
actual or perceived ineffectiveness of online marketing in general  or inaccurate measurements or database information in particular  could limit the long term growth of online advertising and cause our revenue levels to decline 
privacy concerns may prevent us from collecting user data 
growing concerns about the use of cookies and data collection may limit our ability to develop user profiles 
web sites typically place small files of information commonly known as cookies on a user s hard drive  generally without the user s knowledge or consent 
cookie information is passed to the web site through the internet user s browser software 
our oas technology targets advertising to users through the use of identifying data  or cookies and other non personally identifying information 
oas enables the use of cookies to deliver targeted advertising and to limit the frequency with which an advertisement is shown to the user 
most currently available internet browsers allow users to modify their browser settings to prevent cookies from being stored on their hard drive  and a small minority of users are currently choosing to do so 
users can also delete cookies from their hard drive at any time 
some internet commentators and privacy advocates have suggested limiting or eliminating the use of cookies 
any reduction or limitation in the use of cookies could limit the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts and impair our targeting capabilities 
microsoft corporation has changed the design and instrumentation of its web browser in such a way as to give users the option to accept or reject third party cookies 
giving users the option to decline such cookies could result in a reduction of the number of internet users we are capable of profiling anonymously 
such changes also could adversely affect our ability to determine the reach of advertising campaigns sold and delivered by us and the frequency with which users of sites in the network see the same advertisement 
if the use or effectiveness of cookies is limited  we would likely have to switch to other technology that would allow us to gather demographic and behavioral information 
while such technology currently exists  it is substantially less effective than cookies 
replacement of cookies could require significant reengineering time and resources  might not be completed in time to avoid negative consequences to our business  financial condition or results of operations  and might not be commercially feasible 
changes in laws and standards relating to data collection and use practices and the privacy of internet users and other individuals could harm our business 
the us federal and various state governments have recently proposed limitations on the collection and use of information regarding internet users 
in october  the european union adopted a directive that may limit our collection and use of information regarding internet users in europe 
the effectiveness of our oas technology could be limited by any regulation limiting the collection or use of information regarding internet users 
since many of the proposed laws or regulations are just being developed  we cannot yet determine the impact these regulations may have on its business 
in addition  growing public concern about privacy and the collection  distribution and use of information about individuals has led to self regulation of these practices by the internet advertising and direct marketing industry and to increased federal and state regulation 
the network advertising initiative  or nai  of which real media is a member along with other internet advertising companies  has developed self regulatory principles for online preference marketing 
we are also subject to various federal and state regulations concerning the collection  distribution and use of information regarding individuals 
these laws include the children s online privacy protection act  and state laws that limit or preclude the use of voter registration and drivers license information  as well as other laws that govern the collection and use of consumer credit information 
although our compliance with the nai s guidelines and applicable federal and state laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on us  we cannot assure you that additional  more burdensome federal or state laws or regulations  including antitrust and consumer privacy laws  will not be enacted or applied to us or our clients  which could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
changes in government regulation could decrease our revenues and increase our costs 
laws and regulations directly applicable to internet communications  commerce and advertising are becoming more prevalent  and new laws and regulations are under consideration by the united states congress and state legislatures 
any legislation enacted or restrictions arising from current or future government investigations or policy could dampen the growth in use of the internet generally and decrease the acceptance of the internet as a communications  commercial and advertising medium 
state governments or governments of foreign countries might attempt to regulate our transmissions or levy sales or other taxes relating to our activities 
the european union has enacted its own privacy regulations that may result in limits on the collection and use of certain user information by us 
the laws governing the internet  however  remain largely unsettled  even in areas where there has been some legislative action 
it may take years to determine whether and how existing laws such as those governing intellectual property  privacy  libel and taxation apply to the internet and internet advertising 
in addition  the growth and development of internet commerce may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws  both in the united states and abroad  that may impose additional burdens on companies conducting business over the internet 
our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected by the adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to the internet 
our network operations may be vulnerable to hacking  viruses and other disruptions  which may make our products and services less attractive and reliable 
internet usage could decline if any well publicized compromise of security occurs 
hacking involves efforts to gain unauthorized access to information or systems or to cause intentional malfunctions or loss or corruption of data  software  hardware or other computer equipment 
hackers  if successful  could misappropriate proprietary information or cause disruptions in our service 
we may be required to expend capital and other resources to protect our web site against hackers 
we cannot assure you that any measures we may take will be effective 
in addition  the inadvertent transmission of computer viruses could expose us to a material risk of loss or litigation and possible liability  as well as materially damage our reputation and decrease our user traffic 
dependence on proprietary rights and risk of infringement 
our success and ability to compete are substantially dependent on our internally developed technologies and trademarks  which we protect through a combination of patent  copyright  trade secret and trademark law 
we have received two patents in the united states  and have filed and intend to file additional patent applications in the united states 
in addition  we apply to register our trademarks in the united states and internationally 
we cannot assure you that any of our patent applications or trademark applications will be approved 
even if they are approved  such patents or trademarks may be successfully challenged by others or invalidated 
if our trademark registrations are not approved because third parties own such trademarks  our use of such trademarks will be restricted unless we enter into arrangements with such third parties that may be unavailable on commercially reasonable terms 
we generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  consultants and corporate partners  and generally control access to and distribution of our technologies  documentation and other proprietary information 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use or disclosure  parties may attempt to disclose  obtain or use our solutions or technologies 
we cannot assure you that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our solutions or technologies  particularly in foreign countries where laws or law enforcement practices may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
we have licensed  and we may license in the future  elements of our trademarks  trade dress and similar proprietary rights to third parties 
while we attempt to ensure that the quality of our brand is maintained by these business partners  such partners may take actions that could materially and adversely affect the value of our proprietary rights or our reputation 
we cannot assure you that any of our proprietary rights will be of value in the future since the validity  enforceability and scope of protection of certain proprietary rights in internet related industries is uncertain and still evolving 
we may be subject to claims of alleged infringement of the trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third parties by us or the web publishers with web sites in the network 
such claims and any resultant litigation could subject us to significant liability for damages and could result in the invalidation of our proprietary rights 
in addition  even if we prevail  such litigation could be time consuming and expensive to defend  and could result in the diversion of our time and attention  any of which could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
any claims or litigation from third parties may also result in limitations on our ability to use the trademarks and other intellectual property subject to such claims or litigation unless we enter into arrangements with the third parties responsible for such claims or litigation which may be unavailable on commercially reasonable terms 
intellectual property liability 
we may be liable for content available or posted on the web sites of our publishers 
we may be liable to third parties for content in the advertising we serve if the music  artwork  text or other content involved violates the copyright  trademark or other intellectual property rights of such third parties or if the content is defamatory 
any claims or counterclaims could be time consuming  result in costly litigation or divert management s attention 
risks associated with technological change 
the internet and internet advertising markets are characterized by rapidly changing technologies  evolving industry standards  frequent new product and service introductions  and changing customer demands 
our future success will depend on our ability to adapt to rapidly changing technologies and to enhance existing solutions and develop and introduce a variety of new solutions to address our customers changing demands 
we may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful design  development  introduction or marketing of our solutions 
in addition  our new solutions or enhancements must meet the requirements of our current and prospective customers and must achieve significant market acceptance 
material delays in introducing new solutions and enhancements may cause customers to forego purchases of our solutions and purchase those of our competitors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve capital 
cash and cash equivalents are investments with original maturities of three months or less 
therefore  changes in the market s interest rates do not affect the value of the investments as recorded by real media 
the following table presents the amounts of our financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk by expected maturity and average interest rates as of december  in thousands thereafter total cash and cash equivalents   average interest rate loan payable    average interest rate we did not hold any derivative financial instruments as of december  foreign currency risk we transact business in a variety of foreign countries and are thus subject to exposure from adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
this exposure is primarily related to revenue and operating expenses denominated in european currencies 
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations for  and were not material 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to limit our foreign currency risk exposure 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents denominated in foreign currencies
