should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize  or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect  actual future results could differ materially from those anticipated  projected or estimated 
the factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in this section  particularly in results of operations  and liquidity and capital resources 
the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
results of operations the following table shows  for the fiscal years indicated  certain items from the company s consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of net sales 
percentage of net sales fiscal year ended may  net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses facility relocation and legal settlement costs operating profit loss other income expense interest expense interest and other income earnings loss from operations before income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle income tax expense benefit earnings loss before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle cumulative effect of change in accounting principle net earnings loss fiscal compared to fiscal the company s net sales for fiscal were million  down million or from fiscal sales of million 
the graphics business segment had sales of million  down million or from fiscal sales of million 
the web business segment had sales of million  down million or from fiscal sales of million 
the company s net sales performance for fiscal is summarized in the following chart net sales fiscal fiscal change change graphics    web    all other  total    the company s net sales are comprised as follows sales breakdown fiscal fiscal graphics web all other total the continuing and sustained decline in general economic conditions continue to negatively impact the company and the industry in which it operates 
in addition  two customers with formerly recurring business in the graphics segment together representing million in sales during fiscal reduced ongoing projects with the company  these actions both further reduced sales and will continue to affect sales going forward 
the lower sales reflect continued weakness in the promotional projects market  especially direct mail 
increased competitive pressures have also had a negative impact on prices 
the potential for future terrorist attacks  the national and international responses to terrorist attacks  war with iraq and other acts of war or hostility have created many economic and political uncertainties 
these events could adversely affect business and operating results in other ways that presently cannot be predicted 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company announced that it had signed a five year supply chain agreement with international masters publishers inc imp 
the imp contract provides for total net sales of approximately million  although that amount cannot be assured and actual sales under this agreement will depend upon the actual level of orders and activity 
assuming the net sales under the imp contract occur as anticipated  they would substantially affect the company s sales and costs 
due to the timing of the contract  only  of imp sales were recorded in fiscal  and imp sales are not expected to reach their potential until the second quarter of fiscal under the imp agreement  the company incurred significant start up costs  which will be recovered over the term of the agreement  therefore  by its nature  this type of contract exposes the company to additional risk in the event the customer does not perform the agreement or other factors arise which were not anticipated at the onset of this arrangement 
the company s gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the gross profit margin decreased million from fiscal to million 
gross margins decreased primarily as a result of reduced sales  increases in certain raw materials  a product sales mix that produced lower overall profit margins and the continued economic slowdown that continued to put a squeeze on the already competitive markets in which the company operates 
as a consequence of the downturn in sales and termination of certain relationships during the third quarter  the company was overstaffed for its remaining business  however  it decided to retain certain employees in excess of its needs in anticipation of the execution of the imp contract  in addition to the regular labor and material costs for production and services 
that decision increased employee related costs because the company did not take certain steps to lower labor costs than it otherwise would have taken 
the company currently believes that it has sufficient personnel to carry on its current and anticipated business needs  but will occasionally contract for and or hire temporary employees to increase the number of personnel in certain operations  as project commitments require 
in addition to these factors  the company incurred approximately  of direct charges in the fourth quarter for start up costs related to the imp contract 
the company estimates that additional costs for freight  set up  and training will be incurred during the remainder of the imp transition  primarily in the first quarter of fiscal inventory write offs were  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal inventory at may  was million  approximately million higher than at may  the increase in raw material inventory was primarily for clients whose projects began in the first quarter of fiscal in addition  the company began building finished goods inventory in conjunction with the signing of several new long term contracts 
the company continues its efforts related to continuous process improvement and is committed to increasing efforts to provide defect free products and services  all of which have contributed to the overall reduction of costs 
the company experienced quality issues in materials supplied by certain vendors  which negatively affected its performance 
the company is pursuing the reimbursement from the third party vendors  however  it cannot assure that it will receive reimbursement for any of these costs 
in addition  one of the company s presses required unexpected maintenance and repair  which resulted in a loss of net sales and increased expenses 
the company s selling  general and administrative expenses decreased  and represented of the company s net sales during fiscal as compared to of net sales in fiscal the results for fiscal include an impairment charge of   net of tax for the write off of technology and   net of tax related to the amortization of a customer list  both of which related to the company s acquisition of paragon direct in june the company continues to focus on reducing operating expenses  in particular those that do not contribute to increased sales or increased profit margins 
the company has recently made significant investments in training current and new employees to service the new major accounts  without the benefit of corresponding increases in sales to offset them 
during fiscal  the company incurred non recurring facility relocation and legal settlement expenses of  these charges relate to certain unusual charges generated in the first six months for the relocation of the company s former oak creek facility to its neenah facility and the settlement of a lawsuit related to the company s oak creek production facility 
the company incurred approximately  of charges related to the relocation of the facility 
approximately  relates to the facility relocation along with severance costs  and approximately  associated with equipment renovations and start up costs 
these costs included stay bonuses to certain oak creek employees to incent them to remain through the move 
in addition  the costs included moving and reconfiguring certain items of machinery  its subsequent installation in neenah and certain infrastructure changes in neenah to accommodate the move 
the remaining  is the net recovery of legal expenses associated with a lawsuit of the company s former oak creek facility 
the company recognized a charge of  in connection with this lawsuit along with approximately  of associated legal expense during the first quarter of fiscal through a subsequent lawsuit settlement of litigation against a third party and insurance proceeds  the company recognized the  legal recovery during the third quarter of fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recognized an additional  for recovery of related legal expenses  including some legal expenses incurred during the previous fiscal year 
interest expense decreased approximately  from the prior year 
the reduction is due primarily to the extinguishment of the company s long term debt 
the company paid off its remaining long term debt during the second quarter of fiscal in conjunction with the sale of its manufacturing facility in oak creek  wisconsin 
at may   the company had million outstanding on its revolving credit facility at a rate of  and pays an unused credit facility charge of to maintain its line of credit 
the company expects that it will continue to use its revolving credit facility to meet its increased working capital needs as it relates to the new contracts and increased capital expenditures 
the company had a  pre tax loss before a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
the results for fiscal include a  pre tax impairment charge for the write off of technology and  related to the amortization of a customer list both of which related to the company s acquisition of paragon direct in june and direct start up costs related to the imp contract of  fiscal pre tax earnings were million 
the fiscal results include  for the facility relocation and legal settlement costs 
the company s effective tax rate for fiscal was as compared to during fiscal in fiscal the company had a net loss per diluted common share of before a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
the net loss reported by the company including the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle was per diluted common share 
in fiscal  the company reported net earnings of per diluted common share 
the company reported a loss related to the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle net of tax of  or per diluted common share 
effective june  the company adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this statement changed the accounting for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets from an amortization approach to an impairment only approach 
the sfas no 
goodwill impairment model is a two step process 
first  it requires comparison of the book value of net assets to the fair value of the related reporting units that have goodwill assigned to them 
if the fair value is determined to be less than book value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of impairment 
in the second step  the implied fair value of goodwill is estimated as the fair value of the reporting unit used in the first step less the fair values of all other tangible and intangible assets of the reporting unit 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair market value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess  not to exceed the carrying amount of the goodwill 
under adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets being amortized  were tested for impairment 
using the sfas no 
approach described above  the company estimated the fair values of its reporting units using the present value of future cash flows approach  subject to a comparison for reasonableness to its market capitalization at the date of valuation 
as a result  the company recorded a transitional goodwill impairment charge as of june  of approximately   net of income taxes  which is reflected as a cumulative effect of accounting change in the consolidated statement of earnings 
the change in the carrying amount of goodwill by reportable segments were as follows graphics web total june     amortization    may     impairment charge   may    no treasury stock was purchased during the fiscal year fiscal compared to fiscal the company s net sales were million for fiscal  down or million from fiscal net sales of million 
the graphics business segment had net sales for fiscal of million  down million or  from fiscal net sales of the web business segment had net sales for fiscal of million  down or million from fiscal net sales of the economic slowdown experienced in the last six months of fiscal continued into fiscal the effects were exacerbated by the terrorist attacks of september  and the anthrax scare  which diminished promotional mailings and related services 
the ensuing loss of investor confidence and a volatile stock market have further affected the markets for the company s materials 
all of the company s business segments have been negatively impacted by the weakened economy 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the gross profit margin decreased million from fiscal to million 
gross margins decreased primarily as a result of reduced sales  a product sales mix that produced lower overall profit margins  and the continued economic slowdown that continued to put a squeeze on the already competitive markets in which the company operates 
the combination of these factors coupled with operating inefficiencies beyond the non recurring charges as the company merged its oak creek and neenah web facilities  also decreased the company s gross profit margin as compared to its results of operations from the prior year 
inventory write offs were  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal inventory at may  was million  approximately million lower than at may  during fiscal  the company had built up its work in process and finished goods inventory in anticipation of its facility move from oak creek to neenah  and to attempt to help ensure that clients would have the necessary finished goods expected to draw upon during the transition time 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal include approximately  of non recurring facility relocation and legal settlements costs 
excluding the company s non recurring facility relocation and legal settlement costs  the company s selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million and represented of the company s net sales during fiscal as compared to of net sales in fiscal compared to fiscal  the company experienced decreases in travel expenses  professional services  bad debt expenses  administrative wages  and recruiting expenses 
the decrease in professional services was the result of the company resolving its outstanding legal issues and the classification of some analogous expenses in fiscal in the non recurring charges 
the decrease in bad debt expense results from adjusting increases to the bad debt reserves based on continued on going analysis of the potential exposure 
the company continues to focus on reducing operating expenses  in particular those that do not contribute to increased sales or increased profit margins 
the company is deploying resources into marketing strategies in an attempt to increase the company s efforts to increase its sales and marketing concentrations 
the company experienced increases in sales wages and commission expense compared to fiscal year interest expense decreased approximately  from the prior year 
the reduction is due primarily to the extinguishment of the company s long term debt 
the company paid off its remaining long term debt during the second quarter of fiscal in conjunction with the sale of its manufacturing facility in oak creek  wisconsin 
the company s long term debt decreased from million at may  to zero at may  the company did not have to use its line of credit facility during fiscal but pays an unused credit facility charge of to maintain its line of credit 
liquidity and capital resources as shown on the consolidated statements of cash flows  fiscal cash provided from operating activities was  as compared to million in fiscal in fiscal  the company used million to acquire and upgrade existing machinery and equipment 
in addition  the company used million cash from operations to finance the acquisition of its paragon direct operations in june the company s operating cash was decreased by a million increase in inventory 
the company continues to monitor its inventory requirements and the credit worthiness of its clients 
outlook group s board of directors has authorized the payment of quarterly cash dividends 
the company has paid approximately  or per common share in cash dividends in fiscal a continuation of dividends at that level or any level is dependent on resources available in future periods 
the company recently announced its fourth consecutive quarterly cash dividend payment paid during july the cash dividend of per share will result in a total payment of approximately  during the first quarter of fiscal during june  the company purchased selected assets of paragon direct  inc for million in cash plus assumed liabilities 
the paragon direct business was combined into the company s graphics division 
paragon direct provides computer based information management services for clients in the direct marketing industry 
this acquisition opportunity was financed from operating cash flows 
as previously reported  the company holds a single note receivable that is overdue 
the company has obtained a favorable judgment in excess of the value of the note and the company continues to pursue collection 
the company is fully reserved for the possibility that if collection efforts prove ineffective and no payments are received  no impact on current earnings would result if the remaining balance of the note were written off 
the company maintains a credit facility with a bank that provides for a maximum revolving credit commitment of million 
interest on the debt outstanding can vary with the company s selection to have the debt based upon margins over the bank determined preference or an ibor rate 
the company s actual rate is dependent upon the company s performance against a specific ratio as measured against a predetermined performance chart 
the company s failure to meet specified performance measures could adversely affect the company s ability to acquire future capital to meet its needs 
the company did not use its facility during fiscal or the first nine months of fiscal  however  the company is subject to an unused line fee of to maintain its credit facility 
as of may   the company has million outstanding on its revolving credit line at a rate of  as a result of increased working capital needs and increased capital expenditures  and is in compliance with all of its loan covenants 
as of july   the company has million outstanding on its revolving credit line 
the company regularly reassesses how its various operations complement the company as a whole and considers strategic decisions to acquire new operations  expand  terminate  or sell certain existing operations 
these reviews resulted in various transactions during recent fiscal years and may result in additional transactions during fiscal and beyond 
the company continues to pursue the sale of its troy  ohio facility 
although the company has not yet received an acceptable offer  the facility is being leased to a third party on a month to month basis 
it is unclear whether the continuing economic slowdown or other factors will continue to affect the company s ability to sell that facility on terms acceptable or profitable to the company  or whether the company will continue to successfully lease the facility 
the company s primary source of liquidity has been  and continues to be  cash flows 
the company s future cash flows are dependent upon and affected by many factors  including but not limited to the following the ability of the company to attract new and retain existing clients the number and size of the projects completed for these customers the effects of any loss of business of one or more primary customers cancellations or delays of customer orders changes in sales mix changes in general economic conditions and world events the company s ability to successfully complete start up activities related to new long term contracts management s effectiveness in managing the manufacturing process the ability to collect in full and in a timely manner  amounts due the company the ability to acquire and maintain appropriate machinery and equipment the ability to hire  train and retain a suitable work force acquisitions or divestiture activities capital asset additions or disposals environmental matters the company is dependent upon its ability to retain its existing client base  and additionally  obtain new clients 
it s success will depend upon the company s ability to use existing technical and manufacturing capabilities and knowledge in the development and introduction of new value added products and services targeted at new markets and clients through increased marketing initiatives that allow the company to differentiate its products and services from that of its competitor s 
the failure to utilize its capabilities or properly identify and address the evolving needs of targeted customers and markets  will limit the company s ability to capture and develop new business opportunities 
in addition  the company s success is dependent on its ability to manufacture products at a competitive cost and subsequently price them competitively 
the company s failure to do this could significantly affect the future profitability of the company 
due to the project oriented nature of the company s business  the company s largest clients have historically tended to vary from year to year depending on the number and size of the projects completed for these clients 
as with many of the company s clients  the timing and volume of activities can vary significantly from period to period 
there can be no assurance that the volume from any one particular client will continue beyond the current period 
the company had no clients during fiscal or fiscal that accounted for more than of net sales 
the loss of one or more principal clients or a change in the number or character of projects for particular clients could have a material adverse effect on the company s sales volume and profitability 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the company was notified of reductions in volume by two of its major clients with ongoing projects 
these clients represented approximately million of sales during fiscal  and approximately million of sales during fiscal in addition  approximately million of calendar business was lost due to foreign competition 
clients generally purchase the company s services under cancelable purchase orders rather than long term contracts  although exceptions sometimes occur when the company is required to purchase substantial inventories or special machinery to meet orders 
while the company believes that operating without long term contracts is consistent with industry practices  it is committed to developing multi year projects that can add stability to its business  like the imp multi year contract announced march  the company continues to concentrate its efforts on increasing the number of clients with long term contracts  however  the failure of the company to add multi year projects would mean that the company would remain significantly dependent on project by project business  thus increasing the company s vulnerability to losses of business and significant period to period changes 
in addition  significant contracts  such as the contract with imp  expose the company to additional risks  which would result from non performance by the particular customer because of the relative significance of those contracts 
this would continue to make predictions of the company s future results very difficult 
even though the company is looking to increase the volume of longer term contract work  the company expects that it will continue to experience significant sales concentration given the relatively large size of projects accepted for certain clients 
due to the range of services that the company provides  the product sales mix can produce a range of profit margins 
some business in which the company operates  produce lower profit margins than others 
a substantial change in the mix of product sales  could materially affect profit margins 
the profit margin experienced for the current period  is not indicative of future profit margins 
the company believes that while there may be several competitors for individual services that it offers  few competitors offer the single source solution that the company can provide 
the company cannot assure the levels of its sales under its longer term contracts  including the imp contract  due to many factors that could cause its actual results to differ 
these factors include contract disputes  performance problems  customer financial difficulties or changes in business strategies  changes in demand for the customer s products and or future negotiated change to the agreements 
on september   new york city and washington dc suffered serious terrorist attacks and there is the risk that the united states may suffer additional attacks in the future 
furthermore  tensions between the united states and iraq have recently escalated resulting in war 
the ultimate cost associated with terrorism and the war with iraq has placed significant burdens on the united states economy as a whole 
the potential for future terrorist attacks  the national and international responses to terrorist attacks  war with iraq and other acts of war or hostility have created many economic and political uncertainties 
these events could adversely affect our business and operating results in other ways that presently cannot be predicted and for an undeterminable period of time 
promotional mailings by the company s clients were significantly reduced as a result of the terrorist attacks and the subsequent anthrax mailings 
technologies such as the internet will continue to affect the demand for printing services in general and the continuing increases in postal rates and legislation changes such as do not call could impact the direct mail business 
management s effectiveness in managing its manufacturing process will have a direct impact on its future profitability 
the company regularly makes decisions that affect production schedules  shipping schedules  employee levels  and inventory levels 
the company s ineffectiveness in managing these areas could have an effect on future profitability 
from time to time  the company has had significant accounts receivable or other amounts due from its customers or other parties 
on occasion  certain of these accounts receivable or other amounts due have become unusually large and or overdue  and the company has written off significant accounts receivable balances 
the failure of the company s customers to pay in full amounts due to the company could affect future profitability 
declining general economic conditions also increase the risk for the company  as many of its clients could negatively be impacted by the depressed economy 
the company uses complex and specialized equipment to provide its services and manufacture its products  therefore  the company depends upon the functioning of such machinery and its ability to acquire and maintain appropriate equipment 
in addition  the company sometimes must acquire specific machinery in order to perform tasks for particular customers or types of projects  and sometimes must make modifications to meet customer needs 
among other factors  the company may be affected by equipment malfunctions  the inability to timely configure machinery  training and operational needs related to the equipment  which may delay its utilization  maintenance requirements and technological or mechanical obsolescence 
in addition  larger companies with greater capital resources may have an advantage in financing state of the art equipment 
the company is dependent upon its ability to hire  train  and retain a skilled work force 
on occasion  the company will contract for and or hire temporary employees to increase the number of personnel in certain operations as project commitments require 
in may  the company announced a workforce reduction of approximately of its workforce 
the company currently believes that it has appropriately aligned its staffing to be consistent with its current and anticipated levels of business activity 
the failure of the company to properly align and maintain skilled staffing levels could affect the future profitability of the company 
in addition  as occurred in the third quarter of fiscal  the company may in the future again incur additional employee expenses because of the need to maintain a work force in excess of current needs to service anticipated customer products  such a decision would increase expenses in the short term 
the company regularly reassesses how its various operations complement the company as a whole and considers strategic decisions to acquire new operations or expand  terminate or sell certain existing operations 
there can be no assurance that any decisions to acquire new operations  expand  terminate or sell certain existing operations will be implemented successfully 
acquisitions  in particular  are subject to potential problems and inherent risks  including difficulties in identifying  financing and completing viable acquisitions difficulties in integrating the acquired company  retaining the acquired company s customers and achieving the expected benefits of the acquisition  such as expected revenue increases and cost savings loss of key employees of the acquired company the resulting diversion of managements attention away from current operations the assumption of undisclosed liabilities the company s failure to successfully implement any initiatives could affect future profitability 
from time to time  the company may sell or dispose of assets  which it feels are under performing or are no longer needed in the businesses in which the company operates 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to sell or dispose of the assets in a manner  which is profitable to the company 
in addition  the company will make investments in assets that it feels are needed to acquire and maintain the businesses in which the company operates 
again  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to acquire the necessary assets  or that the company can obtain a reasonable return on the investments 
the company and the industry in which it operates are subject to environmental laws and regulation concerning emissions into the air  discharges into waterways and the generation  handling and disposal of waste materials 
these laws and regulations are constantly evolving  making it difficult to predict the effect they may have upon the future capital expenditures  profitability and competitive position of the company 
growth in the company s production capacity with a resultant increase in discharges and emissions could require significant capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in the future 
the company has no off balance sheet arrangements  which would otherwise constitute balance sheet liabilities 
see below  however  for information regarding the company s operating leases 
disclosures about contractual obligations and commercial commitments the sec believes that investors would find it beneficial if aggregated information about contractual obligations and commercial commitments were provided in a single location such that a total picture of obligations would be readily available 
in addition  the sec had suggested the use of a least one additional aid to present the total picture of a registrant s liquidity and capital resource and the integral role of on and off balance sheet arrangements may be schedules of contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of the latest balance sheet date 
the company had no commercial commitments to report as of the latest balance sheet date 
less than contractual obligations total year years years after years long term debt capital lease obligation operating lease     unconditional purchase obligations other long term obligations total contractual cash     disclosures about certain trading activities that include non exchange traded contracts accounted for at fair value the company does not have any trading activities that include non exchange traded contracts accounted for at fair value 
disclosures about effects of transactions with related and certain other parties as previously reported  the company agreed to make loans to certain officers and key employees to purchase the common stock of the company 
at may   the company had loans totaling  the loans bear an interest rate of and are for a five year term 
it is the company s policy that all material transactions between the company  its officers  directors or principal shareholders  or affiliates of any of them  shall be on terms no less favorable to the company than those which could have been obtained if the transaction had been with unaffiliated third parties on an arm s length  and such transactions are approved by a majority of the members of the audit committee of the board of directors  or a majority of the directors who are independent and not financially interested in the transactions 
as a result of legislation enacted on july   the company will no longer make or modify loans to its officers  however  outstanding amounts at that date may continue until paid in accordance with their terms 
disclosure about critical accounting policies the company s accounting policies are disclosed in its fiscal report on form k 
the more critical of these policies include revenue recognition and the use of estimates which inherently involve judgment and uncertainties in valuing inventory  accounts receivable  fixed assets  and intangible assets 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates and assumptions with the audit committee and its board of directors 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized by the company when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of a selling arrangement exists  the company s price to the customer is fixed  collectibility is reasonably assured  and title has transferred to the customer 
generally  these criteria are met at the time of shipment 
the company also offers certain of its customers the right to return products that do no meet the standards agreed upon 
the company continuously monitors and tracks such product returns  and while such returns have historically been minimal  the company cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience the same return rates that it has in the past 
any significant increase in product quality failure rates and the resulting credit returns could have a material adverse impact on the company s operating results 
accounts and notes receivable the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and adjusts credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by the review of the customer s current credit information 
the company continuously monitors collections and payments from its customers and maintains a provision for estimated credit losses based upon the company s historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified 
the company values accounts and notes receivable  net of an allowance for uncollectible accounts 
the allowance is calculated based upon the company s evaluation of specific customer accounts where the company has information that the customer may have an inability to meet its financial obligations bankruptcy  etc in these cases  the company uses its judgment  based on the best available facts and circumstances  and records a specific reserve for the customer against amounts due  to reduce the receivable to the amount that is expected to be collected 
these specific reserves are re evaluated and adjusted as additional information is received that impacts the amount reserved 
the same technique used to compute this allowance at may  has been used during fiscal however  the ultimate collectibility of a receivable is dependent upon the financial condition of an individual customer  which could change rapidly and without advance warning 
inventory the company values inventory at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the first in  first out method 
valuing inventories at the lower of cost or market requires the use of estimates and judgment 
as discussed under further disclosures concerning liquidity and capital resources  including off balance sheet arrangements  customers may cancel their order  change production quantities or delay production for a number of reasons 
any of these  or certain additional actions  could create excess inventory levels  which would impact the valuation of inventory 
the company continues to use the same techniques to value inventory as have been used in the past 
any actions taken by the company s customers that could impact the value of inventory are considered when determining the lower of cost or market valuations 
the company regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on its forecast of product demand and production requirements 
generally  the company does not experience issues with obsolete inventory due to the nature of its products 
if the company were not able to achieve its expectations of the net realizable value of the inventory at its current value  the company would have to adjust its reserves accordingly 
fixed assets and goodwill the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets during fiscal in accordance with the provision of sfas  the company reviews property  plant  and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of property  plant and equipment is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to future net cash flows which the property  plant and equipment are expected to generate 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the property  plant and equipment  if any  exceeds its fair market value 
the company had previously written down the value of certain idle assets by  and  as of may  and  respectively 
on june   the company adopted the provision of sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets for evaluating whether goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets are impaired 
going forward the company will need to review goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets on at least an annual basis to determine whether they are impaired 
under the transitional provisions of sfas no 
 the company has completed the initial impairment tests on goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets associated with each of the company s reporting units  using a valuation date of june  the company recognized a goodwill impairment charge of   net of taxes during fiscal  in its graphics segment 
the impairment has been recorded as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle on the consolidated statements of earnings in accordance with the transitional provisions of sfas no 
in addition  the company wrote off   net of tax of technology related to the company s acquisition of paragon direct in june recently issued financial accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb or the board issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
this statement is effective for the company in fiscal year this pronouncement is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial statements 
in may  the financial accounting standards boars fasb or the board issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity this standard specifies that instruments within its scope embody obligations of the issuer and that  therefore  the issuer must classify them as liabilities 
this statement is effective for the company in fiscal year this pronouncement is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial statements 
other in general  the company believes that the effects of inflation on the company have not been material in recent years 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the following discussion about the company s risk management activities may include forward looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those discussed 
the company has financial instruments  consisting of notes receivable  which are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
however  the company does not use any interest rate swaps or other types of derivative financial instruments to limit its sensitivity to changes in interest rates because of the relatively short term nature of its notes receivable
