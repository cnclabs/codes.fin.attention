the company  through its us industrial switching subsidiary  also provides freight car switching and related services to united states industrial companies with railroad facilities within their complexes 
the company generates revenues primarily from the movement of freight over track owned or operated by its railroads 
the company also generates non freight revenues primarily by providing freight car switching and ancillary rail services 
the company s operating expenses include wages and benefits  equipment rents including car hire  purchased services  depreciation and amortization  diesel fuel  casualties and insurance  materials  net gain loss on sale and impairment of assets  and other expenses

the general downturn in economies in north america for and has adversely affected the company s cyclical shipments of commodities such as paper products in canada  chemicals in the united states  and cement in mexico 
however  shipments of other important commodities such as coal and salt are less affected by economic downturns and are more closely affected by the weather

additionally  the company contributed million of cash to arg partially funded by a million private placement of the convertible preferred with the fund while wesfarmers contributed million in cash  including million which represents a long term australian dollar denominated non interest bearing note to match a similar note due to the company from asr at the date of the transaction 
arg funded the remaining purchase price with proceeds from its australian bank credit facility 
as a direct result of the arg transaction  asr stock options became immediately exercisable by key management of asr and  as allowed under the provisions of the stock option plan  the option holders  in lieu of asr stock  were paid an equivalent value in cash  resulting in a million compensation charge to asr earnings 

table of contents the company recognized a million gain upon the issuance of asr stock to wesfarmers upon the formation of arg as a result of such issuance being at a per share price in excess of the company s book value per share investment in asr

the combined gains totaling million relating to the formation of arg represented the difference between the recorded balance of the company s previously wholly owned investment in australia  less investment amounts that the company estimated would be reimbursed by arg  and the value of those australian operations when arg was formed 
in the fourth quarter of  the company  arg and wesfarmers reached agreement as to the level of acquisition related costs to be reimbursed to both venture partners 
accordingly  in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a  decrease to its previously recorded gains to reflect the lower than estimated reimbursed amount for acquisition related costs 
the company accounts for its ownership in arg under the equity method of accounting and therefore deconsolidated asr from its consolidated financial statements as of december  prior to its deconsolidation  asr accounted for million and of operating revenue and income from operations including the option buyout charge  respectively  for mexico on december   in conjunction with the refinancing of the company s then wholly owned subsidiary  compania de ferrocarriles chiapas mayab  sa de sa fccm  and its parent company  gw servicios  sa de sa servicios see note to consolidated financial statements  the international finance corporation ifc invested million of equity for a indirect interest in fccm  through servicios

the diversity of the company s services  customers  geographic operations  sources of supply and markets reduces the risk that any one event would have a severe impact on the 
table of contents company s operating results 
those areas requiring the greatest degree of management judgment or deemed most critical to the company s financial reporting are discussed below 
management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates described below with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the company s disclosure relating to it in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
goodwill and intangible assets acquired in business combinations the valuation of intangible assets acquired in business combinations requires management to use judgment and make estimates that are critical to the company s financial reports 
the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
as of january  under this pronouncement  a two step goodwill impairment model is used 
step compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount  goodwill would be considered impaired and step measures the goodwill impairment as the excess of recorded goodwill over its implied fair value 
the company tests impairment on an annual basis or when specific triggering events occur 
recoverability and realization of tangible assets the company continually evaluates whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate that its long lived tangible assets may not be recoverable 
when factors indicate that assets should be evaluated for possible impairment  the company uses an estimate of the related undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining lives of assets in measuring whether or not impairment has occurred 
if impairment is identified  a loss would be reported to the extent that the carrying value of the related assets exceeds the fair value of those assets as determined by valuation techniques available in the circumstances 
the company closely monitors its assets in foreign operations where fluctuating currencies and unsettled economic conditions can create greater uncertainty 
the company adopted sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets effective january  financial risk management the company actively monitors its exposure to interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risks and uses derivative financial instruments to manage the impact of certain of these risks 
the company uses derivatives only for purposes of managing risk associated with underlying exposures 
the company does not trade or use instruments with the objective of earning financial gains on the interest rate or exchange rate fluctuations alone  nor does it use instruments where there are not underlying exposures 
complex instruments involving leverage or multipliers are not used 
management believes that its use of derivative instruments to manage risk is in the company s best interest 
however  the company s use of derivative financial instruments may result in short term gains or losses and increased earnings volatility 
derailment and property damages  personal injuries and third party claims the company maintains insurance  with varying deductibles up to  per incident for liability and up to  per incident for property damage  for claims resulting from train derailments and other 
table of contents accidents related to its railroad and industrial switching operations 
accruals for federal employers liability act claims by the company s railroad employees and third party personal injury or other claims  limited when appropriate to the applicable deductible  are estimated and recorded when such claims are incurred 
pensions and other post retirement benefits the company administers two noncontributory defined benefit plans for union and non union employees of two us subsidiaries  one of which was implemented in conjunction with the acquisition of south buffalo 
benefits are determined based on a fixed amount per year of credited service 
the company s funding policy is to make contributions for pension benefits based on actuarial computations which reflect the long term nature of the plans 
the company has met the minimum funding requirements according to the employee retirement income security act 
the plan assets are managed by registered investment companies that invest in balanced asset funds  none of which are invested in the company s stock 
on january   the company froze the defined benefit plan for non union employees 
effective that date  new employees will not be eligible to participate in this plan  and future earnings for current participants will not be eligible in the computation of benefits for those participants 
the company provides health care and life insurance benefits for certain retired employees including union employees of one of its us subsidiaries and certain nonunion employees who have reached the age of with or more years of service 
as of december   there were current or retired employees eligible for these health care and life insurance benefits 
thirty five of the employees currently participate and the remaining sixty nine employees may become eligible for these benefits upon retirement if certain combinations of age and years of service are met 
the company funds the plans on a pay as you go basis 
income taxes the company files consolidated us federal income tax returns which include all of its us subsidiaries 
each of the company s foreign subsidiaries files appropriate income tax returns in their respective countries 
no provision is made for the us income taxes applicable to the undistributed earnings of controlled foreign subsidiaries as it is the intention of management to utilize those earnings in the operations of the foreign subsidiaries 
if the earnings were to be distributed in the future  those distributions may be subject to us income taxes appropriately reduced by available foreign tax credits and withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries 
the amount of undistributed earnings of the company s controlled foreign subsidiaries as of december  is million 
it is not practicable to determine the amount of us income and foreign withholding taxes payable if a distribution of earnings were to occur 
deferred income taxes reflect the net income tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes as well as available income tax credits 
in the company s balance sheets  these deferred benefits and deferred obligations are classified as current or non current based on the classification of the related asset or liability for financial reporting 
a deferred tax obligation or benefit that is not related to an asset or liability for financial reporting  including deferred tax assets related to carry forwards  are classified according to the expected reversal date of the temporary difference as of the end of the year 

table of contents the company s alternative minimum tax credit can be carried forward indefinitely  however  the company must achieve future us taxable income in order to realize this credit 
the company had net operating loss carry forwards from its mexican operations as of december  and of million and million  respectively 
the mexican losses  for income tax purposes  primarily relate to the immediate deduction of the purchase price paid for the fccm operations 
these loss carry forwards will expire  if unused  between and the company had net operating loss carry forwards from its canadian operations as of december  and of million and million  respectively 
the canadian losses primarily represent losses generated prior to the company gaining control of those operations in april these loss carry forwards will expire between and in  the australian government enacted a law allowing the company to deduct  for income tax purposes  depreciation in excess of the financial reporting basis of certain fixed assets it acquired from the government in november at the time  management estimated the company would be unable to fully realize all of the potential income tax benefits and recorded a partial valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets 
the net income tax benefit recorded in as a result of this tax law change was million 
during  management revised its assessment of the likelihood this tax benefit would be realized 
the reassessment resulted in a decrease in the valuation allowance of million 
pursuant to the deconsolidation of asr  the deferred tax assets and related valuation allowance are no longer included in the consolidated results of the company 
as of december  and  the income tax benefit of the canadian net operating losses has been offset by a valuation allowance 
management does not anticipate sufficient taxable income  in amount or character  to utilize the losses prior to expiration 
a portion of the valuation allowance was established in the acquisition of gro  and accordingly  if reversed will result in a decrease to goodwill 
management does not believe a valuation allowance is required for any other deferred tax assets based on anticipated future profit levels and the reversal of current deferred tax obligations 
depreciation due to the capital intensive nature of the railroad industry  depreciation expense is a significant component of the company s operating expense 
the company recorded depreciation and amortization expense of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
at december  and  the company had property and equipment  net balances of million and million which include million and million  respectively  of accumulated depreciation 
property and equipment are carried at historical cost 
acquired railroad property is recorded at the allocated cost 
major renewals or betterments are capitalized while routine maintenance and repairs are charged to expense when incurred 
depreciation is provided on the straight line method over the useful lives of the road property years and equipment years 
management believes that full consideration has been given to all relevant circumstances that the company may be currently subject to  and the financial statements accurately reflect management s best estimate of the results of operations  financial condition and cash flows of the company for the years presented 

table of contents risk factors of foreign operations the company s operations and financial condition are subject to certain risks that could cause actual operating and financial results to differ materially from those expressed or forecast in the company s forward looking statements 
these risks include the fact that the company s joint venture in australia  arg  and some of the company s significant subsidiaries transact business in foreign countries  namely in australia  canada  mexico and bolivia 
in addition  the company may consider acquisitions in other foreign countries in the future 
the risks of doing business in foreign countries may include changes or greater volatility in the economies of those countries  effects of currency exchange controls  changes to the regulatory environment of those countries  changes to the tax laws and regulations of those countries  restrictions on the withdrawal of foreign investment and earnings  the nationalization of the businesses that the company operates  the actual or perceived failure by the company to fulfill commitments under concession agreements  the potential instability of foreign governments  including from domestic insurgency  and the challenge of managing a culturally and geographically diverse operation 
the company s operations in foreign countries are also subject to economic uncertainties  including among others  risk of renegotiation or modification of existing agreements or arrangements with governmental authorities  exportation and transportation tariffs  foreign exchange restrictions and changes in taxation structure 
arg derives a significant portion of its rail freight revenues from shipments of grain 
for example  for the years ended december  and  grain shipments in south australia and western australia generated approximately and  respectively  of arg s operating revenues 
a decrease in grain shipments as a result of adverse weather or other negative agricultural conditions could have a material effect on the company s income from arg and financial condition 
for example  drought conditions during the growing season are expected to result in a significant reduction in arg s grain shipments in australia s open access regime could lead to additional competition for arg s business  which could result in decreased revenues and profit margins 
the legislative and regulatory framework in australia allows third party rail operators to gain access to arg s railway infrastructure upon payment of a regulated fee 
a similar framework governs arg s access to track owned by others 
arg currently operates on the commonwealth owned interstate network from sydney  new south wales and melbourne  victoria to kalgoorlie  western australia and on state owned track in new south wales 
access charges continue to evolve because privatization of railways in australia is recent 
if fees paid by arg to others are increased  arg s operating margins could be negatively affected 
conversely  if a regulator reduces access fees charged to others by arg  then arg s income could be negatively affected 
furthermore  arg has agreements with some customers which would obligate arg to make refunds should access fees charged by arg be reduced 
when arg operates over track networks owned by others  including commonwealth owned and state owned networks  the owners of the network rather than the operators are responsible for scheduling the use of the tracks as well as for determining the amount and timing of the expenditures necessary to maintain the network in satisfactory condition 
therefore  in areas where arg operates over tracks owned by others  it is subject to train scheduling set by the owners as well as the risk that the network may not be maintained adequately 
either risk could affect arg s results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents the results of operations of the company s foreign operations are reported in the local currency the australian dollar  the canadian dollar and the mexican peso and then translated into us dollars at the applicable exchange rates for inclusion in the company s financial statements 
the functional currency of the company s bolivian operations is the us dollar 
the exchange rates between some of these currencies and the us dollar have fluctuated significantly in recent years and may continue to do so in the future 
in addition  because the company s financial statements are stated in us dollars  the translation effect of such fluctuations may affect the company s results of operations and financial position and may affect the comparability of the company s results between financial periods
