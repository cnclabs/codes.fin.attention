these forward looking statements are subject to business and economic risks and uncertainties  and our actual results of operations may differ materially from those contained in the forward looking statements

we also provide services  including design  configuration  implementation and training services  plus customer support services and software enhancement subscriptions 
critical accounting policies and estimates the consolidated financial statements include accounts of the company and all subsidiaries 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
we do not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to the accounting policies described below 
however  application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
revenues and revenue recognition revenue recognition rules for software companies are very complex 
although we follow very specific and detailed guidelines in measuring revenue  certain judgments affect the application of our revenue recognition policy 
the complexity of the revenue recognition rules and estimates inherent in the revenue recognition process makes revenue results difficult to predict  and any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and could result in future operating losses 
our revenues consist of fees from the licensing of software  fees from consulting  implementation and training services collectively  professional services  plus customer support services and software enhancement subscriptions  and sales of hardware 
we recognize software fees in accordance with statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition sop  as amended by statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions sop 
under sop  we recognize software license revenue when the following criteria are met a signed contract is obtained  delivery of the product has occurred  the license fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
sop requires recognition of revenue using the residual method when there is vendor specific objective evidence of the fair values of all undelivered elements in a multiple element arrangement that is not accounted for using long term contract accounting  vendor specific objective evidence of fair value does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements in the arrangement  and all revenue recognition criteria in sop other than the requirement for vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of each delivered element of the arrangement are satisfied 
for those contracts that 
table of contents contain significant customization or modifications  license revenue is recognized under the percentage of completion method 
fees from professional services performed by us are generally billed on an hourly basis  and revenue is recognized as the services are performed 
from time to time  we will enter into professional services agreements in which billings are limited to contractual maximums or based upon a fixed fee for portions of or all of the engagement 
revenue related to fixed fee based contracts is recognized on a percent complete basis based on the hours incurred 
project losses are provided for in their entirety in the period in which they become known 
fees from customer support services and software enhancement subscriptions are generally paid in advance and recognized as revenue ratably over the term of the agreement  typically months 
hardware revenue is generated from the resale of a variety of hardware products  developed and manufactured by third parties  which are integrated with and complementary to our software solutions 
these products include computer equipment  radio frequency terminal networks  bar code printers and scanners and other peripherals 
we generally purchase hardware from our vendors only after receiving an order from a customer  and revenue is recognized upon shipment by the vendor to the customer 
accounts receivable we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
our top five customers in aggregate accounted for  and of total revenue for each of the years ended december    and  respectively 
sales to one customer the significant customer accounted for approximately of total revenue for the year ended december  most of the revenue from the significant customer in arose from purchases of hardware 
no single customer accounted for more than of revenue in or accounts receivable from the significant customer on december  was approximately million 
on january   the significant customer for filed for bankruptcy under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
as a result of the filing  the uncertainties around the bankruptcy proceedings and the ultimate timing of payment  we recorded an allowance of million in to effectively defer revenues arising in the fourth quarter of from the significant customer  but unpaid at the time of the bankruptcy declaration 
the allowance included approximately million of software fees  million of fees for professional services and million of hardware 
in september  the united states bankruptcy court for the northern district of illinois eastern division authorized the significant customer s request to assume the software license  services  support and enhancement agreement 
with the appeals process completed in october  we recovered approximately million during the fourth quarter of valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill our business acquisitions have resulted in  and future acquisitions typically will result in  the recording of goodwill  which represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired  as well as capitalized technology and other definite lived intangible assets 

table of contents in  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets became effective and as a result  we ceased amortizing goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives 
in lieu of amortization  we perform annual impairment reviews 
we completed the initial impairment review of our goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives on june  as required by sfas no 
and no impairment losses were recognized 
additionally  we performed our periodic review of our goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment as of december   and did not identify any asset impairment as a result of the review 
we will continue to test for impairment on an annual basis as of december  or on an interim basis if circumstances change that would indicate the possibility of an impairment 
the impairment review requires an analysis of future projections and assumptions about the company s operating performance 
should such review indicate the assets are impaired  we would record an expense for the impaired assets 
in august  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
this new statement also supercedes certain aspects of apb  reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual  and infrequently occurring events and transactions  with regard to reporting the effects of a disposal of a segment of a business 
sfas no 
requires that we evaluate long lived assets based on the net future cash flow expected to be generated from the asset on an undiscounted basis whenever significant events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in addition  sfas no 
will require expected future operating losses from discontinued operations to be reported as discontinued operations in the period incurred rather than as of the measurement date as presently required by apb 
in addition  more dispositions may qualify for discontinued operations treatment 
the provisions of this statement are required to be applied for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the adoption of this statement did not have a significant impact on the company s financial statements 
acquisitions on october   we acquired substantially all of the assets of intepra  llc intepra for a purchase price of approximately million 
intepra was a provider of warehouse management and transportation management solutions 
we completed the acquisition to enhance our product offering and to expand our customer base 
the purchase price consisted of a cash payment of million  the issuance of approximately million of our 
par value per share common stock totaling  shares  and the issuance by us of a promissory note for million 
we also incurred approximately million of transaction costs related to the acquisition 
the purchase price included the assumption of substantially all of the liabilities of intepra  including immediate payment by us of the remaining million of principal and up to  of interest on a promissory note previously issued by intepra 
the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
based on an independent appraisal  the purchase price was allocated to net liabilities assumed of million  acquired in process research and development of million  acquired developed technology of million  and other intangible assets of million 
values assigned to the acquired in process research and development iprd were determined using the income approach 
to determine the value of the iprd  we considered  among other factors  the state of development of each project  the time and costs required to complete each project  expected income and associated risks  which included the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in completing the project and achieving technological feasibility and risks related to the viability of and potential changes in future target markets 
this analysis resulted in amounts assigned to iprd for projects that had not yet reached technological feasibility and do not have alternative future uses 
acquired developed technology is being amortized over the greater of the amount computed using a the ratio that current gross revenues for a product bear to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues for that product or b the straight line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product including the period being reported on 
approximately million of other intangible assets are being amortized over a seven year useful life 
the remaining million of goodwill was amortized until december   which resulted in accumulated amortization expense of approximately million 
effective january   the other indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer being amortized  but are being reviewed for impairment on at least an annual basis 
on december   we acquired certain assets of logistics 
com  inc from internet capital group for a cash payment of approximately million 
the acquisition has been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
based on an independent appraisal  the purchase price has been allocated to net assets assumed of million  acquired in process research and development of million  acquired developed technology of million  and other intangible assets of million 
values assigned to the acquired in process research and development iprd were determined using the income approach 
to determine the value of the iprd  we considered  among other factors  the state of development of each project  the time and costs required to complete each project  expected income and associated risks  which included the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in completing the project and achieving technological feasibility and risks related to the viability of and potential changes in future target markets 
this analysis resulted in amounts assigned to iprd for projects that had not yet reach technological feasibility and do not have alternative future uses 
acquired developed technology is being amortized over the greater of the amount computed using a the ratio that current gross revenues for a product bear to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues for that product or b the straight line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product including the period being reported on 
approximately million and million of the other intangible assets are being amortized over seven year and two year useful lives  respectively 
the remaining million of goodwill and other intangible assets will not be amortized  but will be reviewed for impairment on an annual basis 
the allocation of purchase price is based on preliminary estimates of the fair value and the estimated useful life of the acquired assets and is subject to revision based upon the finalization of management s assessment of the fair value and estimated useful life of the acquired net assets  particularly intangible assets 
changes in the allocation of purchase price will be limited to changes to the estimated useful lives of other identified intangible assets  possibly resulting in a change in the allocation between indefinite lived assets  which are not amortized  but rather are tested for impairment  and definite lived assets  which are amortized over their useful lives 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentages of total revenues represented by certain items reflected in our consolidated statements of income year ended december  statement of income data revenue software fees services hardware and other recovery allowance for bankrupt customer total revenue costs and expenses cost of software fees cost of services cost of hardware and other research and development sales and marketing general and administrative in process research and development and acquisition related charges amortization of acquisition related intangibles total operating expenses income from operations other income  net income before income taxes income tax provision net income years ended december   and revenue our revenue consists of fees generated from the licensing of software  fees from professional services  customer support services and software enhancement subscriptions  and sales of complementary radio frequency and computer equipment  which are considered non strategic 
total revenue increased from million in to million in  reflecting an overall growth in demand for our sce solutions 
total revenue increased from million in to million in  reflecting continued growth in fees from licensing software and professional services partially offset by an decline in non strategic hardware sales 
we believe our revenue growth in is attributable to several factors  including  among others  geographic expansion  our market leadership positions as to breadth of product offerings and financial stability and a compelling return on investment proposition for our customers 
in spite of the increase in software fees and services revenue over the prior year  we have continued to experience effects from the deterioration of the united states and european economies in the form of delayed and cancelled buying decisions by customers for our software  services and hardware  deferrals by customers of service engagements previously scheduled and pressure by our customers and competitors to discount our offerings 
we believe that prolonged continuation of or further deterioration in the current macro economic conditions and business climates within the united states and or other geographic regions in which we operate  principally the united kingdom and continental europe  could have a material adverse impact on our operations 
there remains much uncertainty as to whether the macro economic and business environmental conditions will further deteriorate or improve in the near future  making forecasting difficult 
software fees 
software fees increased from million in to million in  an increase of million or 
software fees increased from million in to million in  an increase of million or

during the economic downturn  we have experienced some pricing pressures with regard to our services 
we believe that the pricing pressures are attributable to global macro economic conditions and competitive pressures

see further discussion on research and development in item business and in exhibit computer software development costs are charged to research and development expense until technological feasibility is established  after which remaining software production costs are capitalized 
we have defined technological feasibility as the point in time at which the company has a detailed program design on a working model of the related product  depending upon the type of development effort 
for the years ended december  and  the company capitalized no research and development costs because the costs between the attainment of technological feasibility for the related software product through the date of general release were insignificant
