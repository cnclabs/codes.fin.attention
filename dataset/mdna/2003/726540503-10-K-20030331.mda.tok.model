paa was formed in and its first distributions were paid in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following information should be read in connection with the information contained in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
we are an independent energy company 
we are principally engaged in the midstream activities of marketing  gathering  transporting  terminalling  and storage of oil through our equity ownership in paa 
paa is a publicly traded master limited partnership actively engaged in the midstream energy markets 
as of march  we owned of the general partner of paa and million limited partner units of paa  which represented approximately aggregate ownership interest in paa 
we also participate in the upstream activities of acquiring  exploiting  developing  exploring for and producing oil through our wholly owned subsidiary  calumet florida llc  which has producing properties in the sunniland trend in south florida 
the book value of our investment in paa represents of our total assets as of december  and the book value of our florida oil properties represents 
as of december   the present value of our proved oil reserves was approximately million see oil production operations 
we own million common units  million class b common units and million subordinated units of paa 
the closing price of publicly traded paa common units  as reported on the new york stock exchange  was on december  the class b common units and the subordinated units are not publicly traded but do receive cash distributions from paa 
paa s partnership agreement contains provisions which  upon the occurrence of certain future events  will result in the conversion of the subordinated units to common units 
see plains all american pipeline  lp paa cash distributions 
paa s financial performance directly impacts our financial performance and the market value performance of paa s limited partner interests directly impacts the value of our assets 
as a result  we encourage you to review paa s sec filings  including its annual report on form k for the year ended december   to review and assess  among other things  paa s financial performance and financial condition  paa s business  operations  and competition  and risk factors associated with paa s business 

table of contents spin off of plains exploration production company on december  we distributed of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of pxp  to the holders of record of our common stock as of the close of business on december  each stockholder received one share of pxp common stock for each share of our common stock held 
prior to the spin off  we borrowed million under a new term loan facility and used a portion of the proceeds to make a million cash capital contribution to pxp 
in addition  prior to the spin off we made a million cash contribution to pxp and transferred to pxp certain assets and pxp assumed certain liabilities  primarily related to land  unproved oil and gas properties  office equipment and pension obligations 
we received a favorable private letter ruling from the irs stating that  for united states federal income tax purposes  the distribution of our common stock qualified as a tax free distribution under section of the internal revenue code 
the spin off was completed to  among other things allow us to obtain cost savings through improved access to capital markets for our midstream affiliate  paa  allow pxp and us to focus corporate strategies and management teams for each business  and simplify our corporate structure 
in contemplation of the spin off  under the terms of a master separation agreement between us and pxp  on july  we contributed to pxp of the capital stock of our wholly owned subsidiaries that own oil and gas properties in offshore california and illinois 
we also contributed to pxp million in cash and million of intercompany payables that pxp or its subsidiaries owed to us 
on july  pxp issued million of senior subordinated notes due  or the notes  and entered into a million revolving credit facility 
pxp distributed the net proceeds of million from the notes and million of initial borrowings under its credit facility to us 
of such distribution  we used million to redeem our senior subordinated notes  and million to repay and terminate our revolving credit facility 
as a result of the spin off  the number of shares of our common stock into which shares of our series d preferred stock  or series d preferred  is convertible increased from  shares to  shares as a result of the reduction in the conversion price from per share of common stock to per share 
we have  shares of series d preferred outstanding with a stated value per share of million aggregate stated value that bears an annual dividend of per share 
as a result of the spin off the historical results of the operations of pxp are reflected in our financial statements as discontinued operations 
except where noted  discussions in this form k with respect to oil and gas operations relate to our activities other than the discontinued operations 
general upstream operations we follow the full cost method of accounting whereby all costs associated with property acquisition  exploration  exploitation and development activities are capitalized 
our revenues are derived from the sale of oil 
we recognize revenues when our production is sold and title is transferred 
our revenues are highly dependent upon the prices of  and demand for oil 
historically  the markets for oil and gas have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future 
the prices we receive for our oil and our levels of production are subject to wide fluctuations and depend on numerous factors beyond our control  including supply and demand  economic conditions  
table of contents foreign imports  the actions of opec  political conditions in other oil producing countries  and governmental regulation  legislation and policies 
under the sec s full cost accounting rules  we review the carrying value of our proved oil and gas properties each quarter 
these rules generally require that we price our future oil and gas production at the oil and gas prices in effect at the end of each fiscal quarter to determine a ceiling value of our properties 
the rules require a write down if our capitalized costs exceed the allowed ceiling 
we have had no write downs due to these ceiling test limitations since given the volatility of oil prices  it is likely that our estimate of discounted future net revenues from proved oil and gas reserves will fluctuate in the near term 
if oil prices decline in the future  write downs of our oil and gas properties could occur 
write downs required by these rules do not directly impact our cash flows from operating activities 
decreases in oil and gas prices have had  and will likely have in the future  an adverse effect on the carrying value of our proved reserves and our revenues  profitability and cash flow 
to manage our exposure to commodity price risks  we use various derivative instruments to hedge our exposure to oil sales price fluctuations 
our hedging arrangements provide us protection on the hedged volumes if oil prices decline below the prices at which these hedges are set 
however  if oil prices increase  ceiling prices in our hedges may cause us to receive lower revenues on the hedged volumes than we would receive in the absence of hedges 
gains and losses from hedging transactions are recognized as revenues when the associated production is sold 
our oil production expenses include salaries and benefits of personnel involved in production activities  electric costs  maintenance costs  production  ad valorem and severance taxes  and other costs necessary to operate our producing properties 
depletion of capitalized costs of producing oil and gas properties is provided using the units of production method based upon proved reserves 
for the purposes of computing depletion  proved reserves are redetermined as of the end of each year and on an interim basis when deemed necessary 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related benefits of administrative personnel  office rent  systems costs and other administrative costs 
midstream operations we account for our investment in paa using the equity method of accounting 
we record equity in earnings of paa based on our aggregate ownership interest  as adjusted for general partner incentive distributions 
equity in earnings for our general partner interest is based on our share of of paa s net income plus the amount of the general partner incentive distribution 
equity in earnings for our limited partner units is based on our ownership percentage of limited partner units at december  multiplied by of paa s net income less the general partner incentive distribution 
increased earnings attributable to the general partner incentive distributions will be somewhat offset because of our ownership of limited partner units 
cash distributions received from paa are not reflected in earnings  but reduce our investment in paa 
when paa sells additional limited partner units and we do not purchase additional units  our ownership interest in paa is reduced  creating an implied sale of a portion of our investment 
we have recognized gains from paa equity issuances representing the difference between our carrying cost and the fair value of the interest deemed sold 
results of operations our and income statements reflect the results of operations of pxp as discontinued operations 
also  as a result of the sale of a portion of our interest in paa and the resulting change to the equity method of accounting for our investment in paa in  our income statement presentation for is not comparable to our income statement presentations for subsequent periods

oil revenues 
our oil revenues increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to higher realized oil prices that increased revenues by million in versus this increase was offset by lower sales volumes that decreased revenues by million in we reported sales volumes from our florida properties of mbbls in compared to  mbbls in in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin  or sab  we reflect revenue from oil production in the period it is sold as opposed to when it is produced 
oil volumes increased on an as produced basis  with production volumes of mbbls in compared to mbbls in the location of our florida properties and the timing of the barges that transport the oil to market cause reported sales volumes to differ from production volumes 
actual timing of sales volumes is difficult to predict 
the florida oil is typically sold in shipments that range from approximately mbbls to mbbls and typically occurs every days 
in addition  our florida properties consist of a relatively low number of higher volume wells and downtime due to equipment failures and other operational issues can cause production from this area to be volatile 
our average realized price for oil excluding transportation costs increased  or  to per bbl for the year ended december  from per bbl for the prior year 
the increase is primarily attributable to an improvement in the location and quality differential to nymex  which was per bbl in versus per bbl in the average nymex oil price 
table of contents increased slightly to per bbl in compared to per bbl in hedging had the effect of decreasing our average price per bbl by in and in production expenses 
our production expenses decreased  or million  to million for the year ended december  from million for due to lower reported sales volumes 
unit production expenses for were per bbl compared to in the per bbl increase is primarily attributable to increased severance taxes due to higher oil prices in as well as the expiration of severance tax exemptions for several wells during the second quarter of oil transportation costs

loss on debt extinguishment 
we incurred a million loss on debt extinguishment in primarily from the early retirement of million of outstanding senior subordinated notes 
the loss consisted of a call premium of on the outstanding principal amount of the notes  or million  and million of unamortized issue costs on the notes and our revolving credit facility  net of million of unamortized issue premium on the notes 
interest expense 
our interest expense decreased million  to million for the year ended december  from million for the decrease is primarily due to the redemption of the notes and the repayment of amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility on july  from this date through early december  when we borrowed million under our term loan facility  we had no outstanding debt 
outstanding debt during this period was debt of pxp and accordingly  interest expense for this period is reflected in discontinued operations 
income tax expense 
our income tax expense decreased million to million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to lower pre tax income from 
table of contents continuing operations 
pre tax income from continuing operations was significantly higher in as a result of the gains related to the sale of the paa interest 
income from discontinued operations 
income from discontinued operations decreased from million in to million in  primarily reflecting lower revenues due to lower realized prices partially offset by higher sales volumes  higher costs and expenses  and expenses related to a terminated public equity offering

income from discontinued operations 
income from discontinued operations increased from million in to million in  primarily due to higher revenues  reflecting higher prices and sales volumes  partially offset by higher costs and expenses 
cumulative effect of accounting change 
the cumulative effect of accounting change recognized for the year ended december  is for the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
the amount in is for the adoption of sec staff accounting bulletin revenue recognition in financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources general at december  we had negative working capital of million 
cash generated from our upstream operations and paa distributions are our primary sources of liquidity 
we believe that we have sufficient liquid assets and cash from operations and paa distributions to meet our short term and long term normal recurring operating needs  debt service obligations  contingencies and anticipated capital expenditures 
if paa could not  for any reason  make its minimum quarterly distribution payments on its limited partnership interests  this would impair our cash flows and our ability to meet our short and long term cash needs 
in addition  this would trigger our payment obligations under the value assurance agreements for a description of the value assurance agreements  see contingencies value assurance agreements  which would compound the negative impact on our cash flows and our ability to meet our short and long term cash needs 
thus  paa s financial and operational performance directly affects our financial and operational performance 
we encourage you to review paa s sec filings  including its annual report on form k for the year ended december  paa cash distributions paa s partnership agreement requires that it distribute of available cash within days after the end of each quarter to unitholders of record and to its general partner 
available cash is generally defined as all cash and cash equivalents on hand at the end of each quarter less reserves established by paa s general partner for future requirements 
distributions to holders of subordinated units are subject to the rights of holders of common units to receive minimum quarterly distribution  or mqd  of per unit per unit on an annual basis 
common units accrue arrearages with respect to distributions for any quarter during the subordination period and subordinated units do not accrue any arrearages 
the subordination period will end if paa meets certain financial tests for three consecutive four quarter periods 
if paa meets certain financial requirements  of the subordinated units will convert in the fourth quarter of and the remainder will convert in the first quarter of class b common units are initially pari passu with common units with respect to distributions  and are convertible into common units upon approval of a majority of the common unitholders 
if we request that paa call a meeting of common unitholders to consider approval of the conversion of 
table of contents class b units into common units and the approval is not obtained within days  each class b common unitholder will be entitled to receive distributions  on a per unit basis  equal to of the amount of distributions paid on a common unit  with such distribution right increasing to if such approval is not secured within days after the end of the day period 
except for the vote to approve the conversion  class b common units have the same voting rights as the common units 
paa s general partner is entitled to receive incentive distributions if the amount distributed with respect to any quarter exceeds levels specified in its partnership agreement 
generally the general partner is entitled  without duplication  to of amounts paa distributes in excess of per unit  of the amounts paa distributes in excess of per unit and of amounts paa distributes in excess of per unit 
based on paa s current annual distribution rate of per unit  we would receive for an annual distribution from paa of approximately million  including million for our general partner distribution including million for the general partner incentive distribution 
cash distributions on paa s outstanding common units  class b common units and subordinated units and the portion of the distributions representing an excess over the mqd for  and were as follows year excess excess excess distribution over mqd distribution over mqd distribution over mqd first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter reflects distributions to common and class b common unitholders only 
no distribution was declared or paid on the subordinated units owned by us in this period 
financing activities in december we entered into a million secured term loan facility with a group of banks 
we used proceeds from the term loan and cash on hand to make a million capital contribution and repay a million note payable to pxp 
the term loan is repayable in quarterly installments of million each commencing on february  with a final maturity of may  amounts outstanding under the term loan bear an annual interest rate  at our election  equal to either the base rate as defined in the agreement plus  or libor plus 
the term loan requires that we maintain million on deposit in a debt service reserve account with one of the lending banks 
to secure the term loan  we pledged of the shares of stock of our subsidiaries and pledged  of our paa common units 
to the extent that the outstanding principal under the term loan exceeds the balance in the debt reserve account as defined in the agreement plus of the fair market value of the pledged common units  we are required to repay the excess 
the fair market value of the pledged units is determined based on the closing price of paa common units on the new york stock exchange 
the term loan contains covenants that limit our ability  as well as the ability of our subsidiaries  to incur additional debt  make investments  create liens  enter into leases  sell assets  change the nature of our business or operations  guarantee other indebtedness  enter into certain types of hedge agreements  enter into take or pay arrangements  merge or consolidate and enter into transactions with affiliates

environmental matters 
as discussed in items and business properties regulation environmental 
as an owner or lessee and operator of oil and gas properties  we are subject to various federal  state  and local laws and regulations relating to discharge of materials into  and protection of  the environment 
typically when producing oil and gas assets are purchased  one assumes the obligation to plug and abandon wells that are part of such assets 
we have established policies for continuing compliance with environmental laws and regulations 
also  we maintain insurance coverage for environmental matters  which we believe is customary in the industry  but we are not fully insured against all environmental risks 
there can be no assurance that current or future local  state or federal rules and regulations will not require us to spend material amounts to comply with such rules and regulations 
plugging  abandonment and remediation obligations 
consistent with normal industry practices  our oil and gas leases require that  upon termination of economic production  the working interest owners plug and abandon non producing wellbores  remove tanks  production equipment and flow lines and restore the wellsite 
typically when producing oil and gas assets are purchased  one assumes the obligation to plug and abandon wells that are part of such assets 
we have estimated that at december  the costs to perform these tasks will be approximately million  net of salvage value 
effective january   upon adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  we will record the fair value of the liabilities associated with our asset retirement obligations  see recent accounting pronouncements 
other commitments and contingencies 
as is common within the industry  we have entered into various commitments and operating agreements related to the exploration and development of and production from proved oil and gas properties and the marketing  transportation  terminalling and storage of oil 
it is management s belief that such commitments will be met without a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
as discussed in item legal proceedings  in the ordinary course of business  we are a claimant and or defendant in various legal proceedings 
in particular  we are a party to a lawsuit as a result of stocker resources  inc s merger into us regarding an electric services contract with commonwealth energy corporation 
in this lawsuit  we are seeking a declaratory judgment that we are entitled to terminate the contract and that commonwealth has no basis for proceeding against a related million performance bond 
in a countersuit against us  commonwealth is seeking unspecified damages 
we intend to defend our rights vigorously in this matter 
under the spin off agreements  pxp will indemnify us against this lawsuit 
we do not believe that the outcome of these legal proceedings  individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
operating risks and insurance coverage 
our operations are subject to all of the risks normally incident to the exploration for and the production of oil and gas  including well blowouts  cratering  explosions  spills of oil  gas or well fluids  fires  pollution and releases of toxic gas  each of which could result in damage to or destruction of oil and gas wells  production facilities or other property  or injury to persons 
although we maintain insurance coverage considered to be customary in the industry  we are not fully insured against all risks  either because insurance is not available or because of high premium costs 
the occurrence of a significant event that is not fully insured against could have a material adverse effect on our financial position 
our insurance does not cover every potential risk associated with operating our pipelines  including the potential loss of significant revenues 
consistent with insurance coverage generally available to the industry  our insurance

in  paa paid us million for such equity production and we paid paa million in marketing fees  and a separation agreement whereby  among other things  we agreed to indemnify paa  its general partner  and its subsidiaries against a any claims related to the upstream business  whenever arising  and b any claims related to federal or state securities laws or the regulations of any self regulatory authority  or other similar claims  resulting from alleged acts or omissions by us  our subsidiaries  paa  or paa s subsidiaries occurring on or before 
table of contents june   and paa agreed to indemnify us and our subsidiaries against any claims related to the midstream business  whenever arising 
we are currently negotiating a new marketing agreement with paa to  among other things  add a definitive term to the agreement and provide that paa will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the best price for our oil production 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will enter into a new marketing agreement with paa

industry concentration financial instruments which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of accounts receivable with respect to our oil operations and derivative instruments related to our hedging activities 
paa is the exclusive marketer purchaser for all of our equity oil production 
this concentration has the potential to impact our overall exposure to credit risk  either positively or negatively  in that paa may be affected by changes in economic  industry or other conditions 
we do not believe the loss of paa as the exclusive purchaser of our equity production would have a material adverse affect on our results of operations 
we believe paa could be replaced by other purchasers under contracts with similar terms and conditions 
there are a limited number of alternative methods of transportation for our production 
substantially all of our oil production is transported by pipelines  trucks and barges owned by third parties 
the inability or unwillingness of these parties to provide transportation services to us for a reasonable fee could result in our having to find transportation alternatives  increased transportation costs or involuntary curtailment of a significant portion of our oil production which could have a negative impact on future results of operations or cash flows 
the contract counterparties for our derivative commodity contracts are all major financial institutions with standard poor s ratings of a or better 
critical accounting policies and factors that may affect future results based on the accounting policies which we have in place  certain factors may impact our future financial results 
the most significant of these factors and their effect on certain of our accounting policies are discussed below 
commodity pricing and risk management activities 
prices for oil have historically been volatile 
decreases in oil prices from current levels will adversely affect our revenues  results of operations  cash flows and proved reserves 
if the industry experiences significant prolonged future price decreases  this could be materially adverse to our operations and our ability to fund planned capital expenditures 
periodically  we enter into hedging arrangements relating to a portion of our oil production to achieve a more predictable cash flow  as well as to reduce our exposure to adverse price fluctuations 
hedging instruments used are typically fixed price swaps and collars and purchased puts and calls 
while the use of these types of hedging instruments limits our downside risk to adverse price movements  we are subject to a number of risks  including instances in which the benefit to revenues is limited when commodity prices increase

table of contents write downs under full cost ceiling test rules 
under the sec s full cost accounting rules we review the carrying value of our proved oil and gas properties each quarter 
under these rules  capitalized costs of proved oil and gas properties net of accumulated depreciation  depletion and amortization  and deferred income taxes may not exceed a ceiling equal to the standardized measure including  for this test only  the effect of any related hedging activities  plus the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties not included in the costs being amortized net of related tax effects 
these rules generally require that we price our future oil production at the prices in effect at the end of each fiscal quarter and require a write down if our capitalized costs exceed this ceiling  even if prices declined for only a short period of time 
we have had no write downs due to these ceiling test limitations since given the volatility of oil prices  it is likely that our estimate of discounted future net revenues from proved oil reserves will change in the near term 
if oil prices decline in the future  even if only for a short period of time  write downs of our oil and gas properties could occur 
write downs required by these rules do not directly impact our cash flows from operating activities 
based on the book value of our proved oil and gas properties including related deferred income taxes and our proved reserve reports as of december   we believe that we would have a write down under the full cost ceiling test rules at a net realized price for our oil production of approximately per barrel 
based on an estimated oil differential for of per barrel  we would have a write down at a nymex oil index price of per barrel 
oil and gas reserves 
the proved reserve information included herein were based on estimates prepared by outside engineering firms 
estimates prepared by others may be higher or lower than these estimates 
estimates of proved reserves may be different from the actual quantities of oil and gas recovered because such estimates depend on many assumptions and are based on operating conditions and results at the time the estimate is made 
the actual results of drilling and testing  as well as changes in production rates and recovery factors  can vary significantly from those assumed in the preparation of reserve estimates 
as a result  such factors have historically  and can in the future  cause significant upward and downward revisions to proved reserve estimates 
you should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows is the current market value of our estimated proved oil and gas reserves 
in accordance with sec requirements  we base the estimated discounted future net revenues from proved reserves on prices and costs on the date of the estimate 
actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
all of our reserve base is comprised of oil properties that are sensitive to oil price volatility 
historically  we have experienced significant upward and downward revisions to our reserves volumes and values as a result of changes in year end oil and gas prices and the corresponding adjustment to the projected economic life of such properties 
prices for oil and gas are likely to continue to be volatile  resulting in future downward and upward revisions to our reserve base 
our rate of recording dd a is dependent upon our estimate of proved reserves including future development and abandonment costs as well as our level of capital spending 
if the estimates of proved reserves decline  the rate at which we record dd a expense increases  reducing our net income 
this decline may result from lower market prices  which may make it uneconomic to drill for and produce higher cost fields 
the decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of the ceiling test discussed above 
in addition  increases in costs required to develop our reserves would increase the rate at which we record dd a expense 
we are unable to predict changes in 
table of contents future development costs as such costs are dependent on the success of our exploitation and development program  as well as future economic conditions

 accounting for asset retirement obligations becomes effective january  sfas no 
requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred and a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
each period the liability is accreted to its then present value  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
if the liability is settled for an amount other than the recorded amount  a gain or loss is recognized 
for all historical periods presented  we have included estimated future costs of abandonment and dismantlement in our full cost amortization base and these costs have been amortized as a component of our depletion expense 
we have completed our assessment of sfas no 
and we estimate that at january  the present value of our future asset retirement obligation aro for oil and gas properties and equipment is approximately million 
we estimate that the cumulative effect of our adoption of sfas no 
and the change in accounting principle will result in an increase in net income during the first quarter of of million reflecting a million decrease in accumulated dd a  partially offset by million in accretion expense  million net of taxes

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s we are exposed to various market risks  including volatility in oil commodity prices and interest rates 
to manage our exposure  we monitor current economic conditions and our expectations of future commodity prices and interest rates when making decisions with respect to risk management 
we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative trading purposes 
derivative instruments are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended by sfas and sfas  or sfas all derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
if the derivative does not qualify as a hedge or is not designated as a hedge  the gain or loss on the derivative is recognized currently in earnings 
to qualify for hedge accounting  the derivative must qualify either as a fair value hedge  cash flow hedge or foreign currency hedge 
currently  we use only cash flow hedges and the remaining discussion will relate exclusively to this type of derivative instrument 
if the derivative qualifies for hedge accounting  the gain or loss on the derivative is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income  or oci  a component of our stockholders equity  to the extent the hedge is effective 
the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item must be highly effective in achieving the offset of changes in cash flows attributable to the hedged risk both at the inception of the contract and on an ongoing basis 
hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively when a hedge instrument becomes ineffective 
gains and losses deferred in oci related to cash flow hedges that become ineffective remain unchanged until the related product is delivered 
if it is determined that it is probable that a hedged forecasted transaction will not occur  deferred gains or losses on the hedging instrument are recognized in earnings immediately 
we formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items  as well as our risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking the hedge 
hedge effectiveness is measured on a quarterly basis 
this process includes specific identification of the hedging instrument and the hedged item  the nature of the risk being hedged and how the hedging instrument s effectiveness will be assessed 
both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis  we assess whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items 
no amounts were excluded from the computation of hedge effectiveness 
at december   all open positions qualified for hedge accounting 

table of contents we utilize various derivative instruments to hedge our exposure to price fluctuations on oil sales 
the derivative instruments consist primarily of cash settled oil option and swap contracts entered into with financial institutions 
at december  oci consisted of unrealized losses of i million million  net of tax on our oil hedging instruments  ii million million  net of tax related to our equity in the oci loss of paa  and iii million million  net of tax related to pension liabilities 
at december   the liability related to our open oil hedging instruments was included in current liabilities million  and deferred income taxes a tax benefit of million during oil sales revenues were reduced by million for non cash expense related to the amortization of option premiums 
as of december   million million  net of tax of deferred net losses on our oil hedging instruments recorded in oci are expected to be reclassified to earnings during commodity price risk 
at march   we had the following open oil hedge positions barrels per day swaps average price bbl average price bbl assuming our fourth quarter sales volumes are held constant in subsequent periods  these positions result in our hedging approximately and of oil sales in and  respectively 
location and quality differentials attributable to our properties are not included in the foregoing prices 
because of the quality and location of our oil production  these adjustments will reduce our net price per barrel 
the agreements provide for monthly cash settlement based on the differential between the agreement price and the actual nymex price 
gains or losses are recognized in the month of related production and are included in oil sales revenues 
such contracts resulted in a reduction of revenues of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the fair value of outstanding oil derivative commodity instruments and the change in fair value that would be expected from a percent price decrease are shown in the table below in millions december  effect of effect of fair price fair price value decrease value decrease swaps and options contracts the fair value of the swaps and option contracts are estimated based on quoted prices from independent reporting services compared to the contract price of the swap and approximate the gain or loss that would have been realized if the contracts had been closed out at year end 
all hedge positions offset physical positions exposed to the cash market 
none of these offsetting physical positions are included in the above table 
price risk sensitivities were calculated by assuming an across the board percent decrease in price regardless of term or historical relationships between the contractual price of the instruments and the underlying commodity price 
in the event of an actual percent change in prompt month oil prices  the fair value of our derivative portfolio would typically change less than that shown in the table due to lower volatility in out month prices 
in the fourth quarter of we terminated our open oil put options with enron risk management corp 
and charged earnings for million  representing unamortized premiums for 
table of contents such options 
the contract counterparties for our current derivative commodity contracts are all major financial institutions with standard poor s ratings of a or better 
our management intends to continue to maintain hedging arrangements for a significant portion of our production 
these contracts may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances 
our hedging arrangements provide us protection on the hedged volumes if oil prices decline below the prices at which these hedges are set  but ceiling prices in our hedges may cause us to receive less revenue on the hedged volumes than we would receive in the absence of hedges 
interest rate risk 
our debt instruments are sensitive to market fluctuations in interest rates 
at december  we had million outstanding under our credit facility  repayable million in  million in and million in our credit facility bears interest at a base rate as defined or libor plus the applicable margin at december  
the carrying value of our credit facility debt approximates fair value because interest rates are variable  based on prevailing market rates
