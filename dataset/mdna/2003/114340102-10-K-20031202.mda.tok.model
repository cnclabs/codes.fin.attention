overview we are a leading supplier of automation products and solutions primarily serving the worldwide semiconductor market 
we supply hardware  software and services to both chip manufacturers and original equipment manufacturers  or oems  who make process equipment for semiconductor manufacturing 
our offerings range from hardware and software modules to fully integrated systems and services 
although our core business addresses the increasingly complex automation requirements of the global semiconductor industry  we are also focused on providing automation solutions for a number of related industries  including flat panel display manufacturing  data storage and other complex manufacturing 
we operate in three major segments equipment automation  factory automation hardware and factory automation software 
equipment or tool automation consists of hardware and software used on or within process tools to move individual wafers in and out of a tool 
factory automation hardware consists of equipment used inside the fab  but external to a process tool  to automate the handling of batches of wafers or other material throughout the production floor  as well as specialized tools for automatically sorting  storing and inspecting material 
factory automation software is used within a factory in computer integrated manufacturing for controlling and managing production and resources in a fab 
we sell our products and services to nearly every major semiconductor chip manufacturer and oem in the world  including all of the top ten chip companies and nine of the top ten equipment companies 
traditionally  our foreign revenues have been generally denominated in united states dollars 
accordingly  foreign currency fluctuations have not had a significant impact on the comparison of the results of operations for the periods presented 
the costs and expenses of our international subsidiaries are generally denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar 
however  since the functional currency of our international subsidiaries is the local currency  foreign currency translation adjustments are reflected as accumulated other comprehensive income loss  which is a component of stockholders equity 
to the extent that we expand our international operations or change our pricing practices to denominate prices in foreign currencies  we will be exposed to increased risk of currency fluctuation 
in view of the recent downturn in the semiconductor industry and the resulting market pressures  together with recent indications of a possible market recovery  we are focusing our major efforts in the following areas controlling and reducing costs  aligning costs and revenues to move to break even and then profitable levels of operation  including positive operating cash flow  even if the recent downturn continues  consolidating and integrating the businesses and assets that we have acquired in recent years  completing the consolidation of manufacturing without diminishing our ability to respond to customer demand  either currently or at such time as market conditions improve  developing the products and services required for future success in the market  expanding sales and service in china  expanding into other industries such as flat panel display manufacturing and life sciences  
table of contents preparing ourselves for possible increases in customer demand in the event of a market upturn while at the same time maintaining expense control and limiting increases to our cost structure  and improving the efficiency of our internal information and business systems

related party transactions and amounts included in accounts receivable and revenue are on standard pricing and contractual terms and manner of settlement for products and services of similar types and at comparable volumes 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to product returns  bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  excess component order cancellation costs  restructuring and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  including current and anticipated worldwide economic conditions both in general and specifically in relation to the semiconductor industry  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
as discussed under restructuring  asset impairments and the year over year comparisons below  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenues revenue from product sales and software licenses that do not include significant customization is recorded upon transfer of title and risk of loss to the customer provided there is evidence of an arrangement  fees are fixed or determinable  collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured and customer acceptance criteria have been successfully demonstrated 
customer acceptance provisions include final testing and acceptance carried out prior to shipment 
these pre shipment testing and acceptance procedures ensure that the product meets the published specification requirements before the product is shipped 
shipping terms are customarily fob shipping point 
costs incurred for shipping and handling are included in revenues and cost of sales 
a provision for product warranty costs is recorded to estimate costs associated with warranty liabilities 
when significant on site customer acceptance provisions are present in the arrangement  revenue is generally recognized upon completion of customer technical acceptance testing 
in the event significant uncertainties remain  revenue is deferred and recognized when such obligations are fulfilled by us or the uncertainties are resolved 
we enter into two types of significant multi element arrangements tailored software arrangements  described below  and software sales with post contract support 
revenue for the undelivered support on multi element software sales with post contract support is deferred based on vendor specific objective evidence of the value of the support 
for tailored software contracts  we provide significant consulting services to tailor the software to the customer s environment 
if we are able to reasonably estimate the level of effort and related costs to complete the contract  we utilize the percentage of completion method 
revisions in revenue and cost estimates are recorded in the periods in which the facts that require such revisions become known 
if our ability to complete the tailored software is uncertain or if we cannot reasonably estimate the level of effort and related costs  completed contract accounting is applied 
losses  if any  are provided for in the period in which such losses are first identified by management 
generally  the terms of long term contracts provide for progress billing based on completion of certain phases of work 
for maintenance contracts  service revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract 
deferred revenue primarily relates to services and maintenance agreements and long term contracts accounted for using the completed contract method 
in transactions that include multiple products and or services  we allocate the sales value among each of the deliverables based on their relative fair values and recognizes such revenue when they are delivered 
revenue recognition involves judgments  and assessments of expected returns  the likelihood of nonpayment and estimates of expected costs and profits on long term contracts 
we analyze various factors  including a review of specific transactions  historical experience  credit worthiness of customers and current market and economic conditions in determining when to recognize revenue 
changes in judgments on these 
table of contents factors could impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized with a resulting impact on the timing and amount of associated income 
intangible assets and goodwill we have made a number of acquisitions  and as a result  identified significant intangible assets and generated significant goodwill 
intangible assets are valued based on estimates of future cash flows and amortized over their estimated useful life 
goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing 
intangible assets and other long lived assets are subject to an impairment test if there is an indicator of impairment 
the carrying value and ultimate realization of these assets is dependent upon estimates of future earnings and benefits that we expect to generate from their use 
if our expectations of future results and cash flows change and are significantly diminished  intangible assets and goodwill may be impaired and the resulting charge to operations may be material 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure impairment based on one of three methods 
for assets related to ongoing operations that we plan to continue  we use a projected undiscounted cash flow method to determine whether impairment exists  and then measure impairment using discounted cash flows 
for assets to be disposed of  we assess the fair value of the asset based on current market condition for similar assets 
for goodwill  we assess fair value by measuring discounted cash flows of our reporting units and measures impairment as the difference between the resulting implied fair value of goodwill and the recorded book value 
the estimates of useful lives and expected cash flows require us to make significant judgments regarding future periods that are subject to some factors outside of our control 
changes in these estimates can result in significant revisions to the carrying value of these assets and may result in material charges to the results of operations 
accounts receivable we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate or economic conditions were to further deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required  with a resulting charge to results of operations 
restructuring we provide reserves for estimated severance benefits and estimated lease obligations net of estimated sublease income for abandoned facilities 
should actual severance benefits and lease obligations differ from our estimates  excess reserves may be identified or additional reserves may be required  with a resulting benefit or charge to results of operations 
warranty we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required and may result in additional charges to results of operations 
inventory we provide reserves for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
we fully reserve for inventories deemed obsolete 
we perform periodic reviews of all inventory items to identify excess inventories on hand by comparing on hand balances to anticipated usage using recent historical activity as well as anticipated or forecasted demand  based upon sales and marketing 
table of contents inputs through our planning systems 
if estimates of demand diminish further or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
deferred taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
in the event we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in excess of their net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
restructuring our business is significantly dependent on capital expenditures by semiconductor manufacturers and oem s  that are  in turn  dependent on the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors 
our revenues grew substantially in fiscal and the first half of fiscal  due in large part to high levels of capital expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers 
demand for semiconductors is cyclical and has historically experienced periodic downturns 
the semiconductor industry has experienced such a downturn during the past two years 
the downturn adversely affected revenues  gross margins and operating results 
in response to this prolonged and continued downturn  we have implemented and continue to implement cost reduction programs aimed at aligning our ongoing operating costs with our currently expected revenues over the near term 
these cost management initiatives have included consolidating facilities  reductions to headcount  salary and wage reductions and reduced spending 
although we continue to address cost management in response to the downturn  we will continue to invest in those areas which we believe are important to our long term growth  including customer support and new products 
fiscal restructuring based on estimates of our near term future revenues and operating costs  we announced and implemented in fiscal several plans to take additional and significant cost reduction actions 
accordingly  charges of million were recorded for these actions 
of this amount  million related to workforce reductions of approximately  employees  million related to excess facilities and million related to the write off of capitalized costs of cancelled internal systems application infrastructure programs 
excess facilities charges of million consisted of million for excess facilities identified in fiscal that were recorded to recognize the remaining lease obligations  net of any sublease rentals 
these costs have been estimated from the time when the space is expected to be vacated and there are no plans to utilize the facilities in the future 
costs incurred prior to vacating the facilities are being charged to operations 
the remaining million represents a reevaluation of assumptions used in determining the fair value of certain lease obligations related to facilities abandoned in a previous restructuring 
the revised assumptions  including lower estimates of expected sub rental income over the remainder of the lease terms are based on management s evaluation of the rental space available 
periodically  the accruals related to restructuring charges are reviewed and compared to their respective cash requirements 
as a result of those reviews  the accruals are adjusted for changes in cost and timing assumptions of previously accrued and recorded initiatives 
during fiscal  we identified million of excess accruals associated with headcount reduction plans previously announced and implemented and million of excess accruals for other restructuring costs 
the final costs associated with these actions were lower than originally anticipated and accrued 
as a result  the excess accruals for these actions were reversed  with a corresponding reduction to restructuring expense 
we believe that the cost reduction programs implemented will align costs with revenues and allow us to achieve breakeven results and eventual profitability 
in the event we are unable to achieve this alignment  additional cost cutting programs may be required in the future 
given the severity of current market conditions  however  we cannot make any assurance that these cost reduction programs will actually 
table of contents align our operating expenses and revenues or be sufficient to avoid operating losses  or that additional cost reduction programs will not be necessary in the future 
fiscal restructuring in september  we approved a formal plan of restructure in response to the ongoing downturn in the semiconductor industry  which continued to exert downward pressure on our revenues and cost structure 
to that effect  we recorded restructuring charges of million in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 
of this amount  million was related to workforce reductions of approximately employees  which was paid in fiscal  million was for the consolidation of several of our facilities  and million was for other restructuring costs 
these measures were largely intended to further align our capacity and infrastructure to anticipated customer demand  which was adversely affected by the continuing downturn in the semiconductor industry 
workforce related charges  consisting principally of severance costs  were recorded based on specific identification of employees to be terminated  along with their job classifications or functions and their locations 
the charges for our excess facilities were recorded to recognize the remaining lease obligations  net of any sublease rentals 
these costs have been estimated from the time when the space was expected to be vacated and there are no plans to utilize the facility in the future 
costs incurred prior to vacating the facilities were charged to operations 
as part of the plan to integrate the pri acquisition  certain sales  technical support and administrative functions were combined and headcount and related costs reduced 
accordingly  during the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded million of restructuring charges comprised of million for workforce reduction related costs for our existing employees  million related to our excess existing facilities and million of other restructuring costs 
the million for our excess facilities was recorded to recognize the remaining lease obligations  net of any sublease rentals 
these costs were estimated from the time that these facilities are expected to be vacated and there were no plans to utilize the facility in the future 
costs incurred prior to vacating the facilities were charged to operations 
restructuring costs of million for former pri employees  million for pri facilities and million for other costs were accrued as part of the purchase accounting for the pri acquisition  relating to the consolidation and elimination of certain pri duplicate facilities and redundant pri personnel 
we anticipated headcount reductions of approximately people across all functional areas of the combined company and  as such  included an estimated accrual for workforce reductions of million comprised of severance  employee benefits and outplacement support 
as of september   of these employees had been terminated  and million of severance and other workforce related costs had been paid 
the former chief executive officer of pri entered into a non competition agreement with us  which became effective upon completion of the combination and which required a total payment of million over a two year period 
we identified redundant facilities consisting of sales and support offices  manufacturing facilities and administrative offices 
as such  an accrual of million to terminate lease obligations under these agreements was provided 
these payments represent the fair value of the minimum rental commitment on facilities with lease terms to as discussed above  we accrued an additional million in fiscal related to these facilities 
in addition  we accrued million for amounts to be incurred subsequent to the acquisition related to legal costs to close subsidiaries of pri 
periodically  the accruals related to the acquisition related and restructuring charges are reviewed and compared to their respective cash requirements 
as a result of those reviews  the accruals are adjusted for changes in cost and timing assumptions of previously approved and recorded initiatives 
during the year ended september   we identified excess workforce related accruals recorded for earlier initiatives of million  which were reversed in the year ended september  fiscal restructuring in september  we approved a formal plan of restructure in response to the downturn in the semiconductor industry 
to that effect  we recorded restructuring charges of million in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 
of this amount  million was related to workforce reductions of approximately 
table of contents employees  which was paid in  and million for the consolidation and strategic focus realignment of several facilities 
workforce charges  consisting principally of severance costs  were recorded based on specific identification of employees to be terminated  along with their job classifications or functions and their locations 
the charges for our excess facilities were recorded to recognize the remaining lease obligations  net of any sublease rentals 
these costs were estimated from the time the space was expected to be vacated and there are no plans to utilize the facility in the future 
costs incurred prior to vacating the facilities were charged to operations 
the activity related to our restructuring accruals described above is below in thousands fiscal activity new initiatives balance balance september  purchase september  expense accounting reversals utilization facilities workforce related other fiscal activity new initiatives balance balance september  purchase september  expense accounting reversals utilization facilities workforce related other fiscal activity new initiatives balance balance september  purchase september  expense accounting reversals utilization facilities workforce related other asset impairments we elected to early adopt the provisions of fas effective october  accordingly  we ceased the ratable amortization of goodwill on that date 
we were required to perform an annual impairment test of our goodwill by march  under the provisions of fas we completed our initial testing as required and determined that there was no impairment as of october  we compared the fair value of each reporting unit to its recorded book value 
an excess of book value over fair value indicates that an impairment of goodwill exists 
the fair value of goodwill is determined on an implied residual basis by deducting the fair value of all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit  including non acquired intangible assets not recorded  from the total fair value of the reporting unit 
impairment of goodwill is measured as the excess of the recorded value of goodwill over the implied residual value 
the impairment testing was based on discounted cash flow analyses of expectations of future 
table of contents earnings for each of the reporting units over the remaining estimated lives of the primary assets of the reporting unit 
during this annual impairment test in fiscal  as we completed our annual budgeting process  we concluded that the goodwill related to our factory automation hardware segment was impaired due to estimated revenues and cash flows of our product offerings related to this segment 
the write down of goodwill of million is included within amortization of acquired intangible assets and asset impairment charges in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended september  in fiscal  primarily as a result of the continuing downturn in the semiconductor industry and uncertainty as to the timing and speed of recovery for the sector  we concluded that goodwill related to our equipment automation  factory automation hardware and factory automation software segments was impaired 
accordingly  we recorded a charge to operations of million for the write down of goodwill 
the write down of goodwill is included within amortization of acquired intangible assets and asset impairment charges in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended september  we perform an assessment of the carrying values of our intangible assets as prescribed by financial accounting standards board statement no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets fas if indicators of impairment exist 
the impairment testing is based on undiscounted cash flows to determine if an impairment existed 
any resulting impairments are measured utilizing discounted cash flow analyses of expectations of future earnings related to existing long lived assets for each of the reporting units over the remaining estimated useful lives of the primary assets of the reporting unit 
as a result of the potential impairment indicated by the impairment of our goodwill  testing was performed 
this assessment resulted in no impairment of intangible assets in our segments for the year ended september  in fiscal  we performed this assessment under the provisions of financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of fas due to the potential impairment indicated by the large impairment of our goodwill 
the assessment resulted in the impairment of intangible assets in each of our segments 
accordingly  we recorded a charge to operations of million for the write down of intangible assets 
this charge is included within amortization of acquired intangible assets and asset impairment charges in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended september  year ended september   compared to year ended september  we reported a net loss of million in the year ended september   compared to a net loss of million in the previous year 
the results for the year ended september  include charges of million for the ratable amortization of acquired intangible assets  million for the impairment of goodwill associated with our acquisitions  million of acquisition related and restructuring charges and million of other charges 
these other charges include million recorded to cost of product revenues  million recorded to research and development expense  million recorded to selling  general and administrative expense and million recorded to other income expense  net 
the charge to cost of product revenues is comprised of million for valuation adjustments to inventories  million for accelerated depreciation on property  plant and equipment  million for retention bonuses and million for deferred compensation related to stock options granted to employees of acquired companies 
the charge to research and development represents million of accelerated depreciation on property  plant and equipment and million for deferred compensation related to stock options granted to employees of acquired companies 
the charge to selling  general and administrative expense is comprised of million of accelerated depreciation on property  plant and equipment and million for deferred compensation related to stock options granted to employees of acquired companies 
the charge to other income expense  net is comprised of million for the loss on the disposal of shinsung engineering co  ltd 
shinsung warrants  million for the loss on the disposal of shinsung common shares and million of other charges 
the results for the year ended september  include charges of million for the ratable amortization of acquired intangible assets  million for the impairment of identifiable intangible assets 
table of contents and million for the impairment of goodwill associated with our acquisitions  million for the write down of the value of our net deferred tax asset  million of restructuring and acquisition related charges and million of other charges 
these other charges include million recorded to cost of product revenues  million recorded to research and development expense and million recorded to selling  general and administrative expense 
the charge to cost of product revenues is comprised of million for valuation adjustments to inventories  million for additional warranty reserves  million for loss reserves on acquired contracts  million for the write down of an obsolete tool used in our manufacturing process and million for deferred compensation related to stock options granted to employees of acquired companies 
the charge to research and development represents deferred compensation related to stock options granted to employees of acquired companies 
the charge to selling  general and administrative expense is comprised of million for deferred compensation related to stock options granted to employees of acquired companies and million of executive severance accruals 
we provided million and million in fiscal and  respectively  as a result of the periodic reviews of obsolete and excess inventory 
the inventory affected was across several hardware product lines in the equipment automation and factory automation hardware segments 
it has been our practice to also discuss certain of our financial measures and results excluding certain acquisition related  restructuring and other charges 
these measures and results are not measures recognized under generally accepted accounting principles and may not be comparable to those of other companies 
we do not intend or suggest that you consider these alternative measures and results as indicators of operating performance 
we believe that presenting our operating results before taking into account such charges provides useful information to aid in understanding ongoing  recurring operations 
revenues we reported revenues of million for the year ended september   compared to million in the previous year  a increase 
the increase in revenues is principally attributable to a full year of incremental revenue from the acquisitions consummated during fiscal offset by the downturn that affected the semiconductor industry throughout the year 
our equipment automation segment reported revenues of million in the year ended september   an increase of from the prior year 
this increase is attributable to a full year of incremental revenues from fiscal acquisitions  partially offset by the continuing downturn in the semiconductor industry 
our factory automation hardware segment reported a increase  to million  in the year ended september   compared to the previous year 
the increase is attributable to a full year of incremental revenues from fiscal acquisitions 
our factory automation software segment reported revenues of million  a slight increase from million in the prior year 
product revenues increased million  or  to million  in the year ended september   from million in the previous fiscal year 
this increase is attributable to a full year of incremental revenues from fiscal acquisitions 
service revenues increased million  or  to million 
this increase is primarily attributable to a full year of incremental revenues from fiscal acquisitions 
revenues outside the united states were million  or of revenues  and million  or of revenues  in the years ended september  and  respectively 
we expect that foreign revenues will continue to account for a significant portion of total revenues 
the current international component of revenues is not indicative of the future international component of revenues 
deferred revenues of million at september  consisted of million related to deferred maintenance contracts and million related to revenues deferred for completed contract method arrangements 
gross margin gross margin increased to for the year ended september   compared to for the previous year 
before other charges as described above of million and million in the years ended 
table of contents september  and  respectively  gross margins on revenues were and  respectively 
our equipment automation segment gross margin increased to in the year ended september   from in the prior year 
gross margin for our factory automation hardware segment increased to in the year ended september   from in the prior year 
the increases above are primarily the result of our plant consolidation and other cost reduction measures 
our factory automation software segment s gross margin for the year ended september   increased to  compared to in the prior year 
the change is primarily due to favorable product mix shifts between license and service revenues 
gross margin on product revenues was for the year ended september   compared to for the prior year 
gross margin on product revenues was for the year ended september   before other charges aggregating million 
gross margin on product revenues was for the year ended september   before other charges aggregating million 
the decrease in margin is primarily attributable to the lower manufacturing utilization we experienced in connection with the continuing downturn in the semiconductor industry 
many of our manufacturing costs are fixed  and a decrease in revenue therefore has the effect of reducing our gross margin 
gross margin on service revenues increased to for the year ended september   from in the previous year 
the increase is primarily a result of changes in our service revenue mix from services to license revenues  coupled with the impact of our cost reduction initiatives 
we provided million and million in fiscal and  respectively  as a result of the periodic reviews of obsolete and excess inventory 
the inventory affected was across several hardware product lines in the equipment automation and factory automation hardware segments 
research and development research and development expenses for the year ended september   were million  a decrease of million  compared to million in the previous year 
research and development expenses also decreased as a percentage of revenues  to  from in the prior year 
research and development expenses were of revenues in fiscal  before other charges of million 
research and development expenses were of revenues in fiscal  before other charges of million 
the decrease in absolute spending and as a percentage of revenues is primarily the result of our cost reduction actions 
our plan is to continue to invest in research and development to enhance existing and develop new tool and factory hardware and software automation solutions for the semiconductor  data storage and flat panel display manufacturing industries 
these investments will be focused on those research and development projects that are most consistent with our business realignment 
we expect our future research and development expenses will trend lower as a full year of cost reduction benefits are realized in fiscal selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended september   a decrease of million  compared to million in the prior year 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of revenues  to in the year ended september   from in the previous year 
selling  general and administrative expenses were of revenues in the year ended september   before other charges of million 
selling  general and administrative expenses were of revenues in the year ended september   before other charges of million 
the decrease in absolute spending and as a percentage of revenues is primarily the result of our cost reduction activities including headcount reductions 
we expect that future expenditure levels will trend lower as a full year of the benefits from the cost reduction activities is realized 
amortization of acquired intangible assets and impairment charges amortization expense and impairment charges for acquired intangible assets and goodwill totaled million for the year ended september   and are comprised of million of impairment charges of our goodwill as described previously in asset impairments and million of ratable amortization of acquired intangible assets from prior acquisitions 
we adopted fasb statement no 
 
table of contents goodwill and other intangibles fas on october  and accordingly  we ceased the ratable amortization of goodwill 
amortization expense and impairment charges for acquired intangible assets and goodwill totaled million for the year ended september   and are comprised of million and million of impairment charges of our identifiable intangible assets and goodwill  respectively  and million of ratable amortization of acquired intangible assets from prior acquisitions 
acquisition related and restructuring costs we recorded a charge to operations of million in the year ended september   of which million related to acquisitions  million related to the write off of capitalized costs associated with cancelled internal systems applications and infrastructure programs  and million to restructuring costs as detailed above 
the million related to acquisitions is comprised of the million loss on the disposition of our swiss subsidiary  associated legal costs of million and million of legal  relocation and consulting costs to integrate and consolidate acquired entities into our existing entities 
we recorded a million charge to operations in the year ended september   of which million related to acquisitions and aborted acquisitions and million to restructuring costs as detailed above 
the acquisition costs are comprised of million related to the vesting by our chief executive officer in certain incremental retirement benefits upon the closing of the acquisition of pri on may   million to write off loans to aborted acquisition targets that management determined are no longer collectible and million of other costs 
interest income and expense interest income decreased by million  to million  in the year ended september   from million the previous year 
this decrease is due primarily to lower cash balances that were available for investment and lower interest rates that were realized on our investment balances 
interest expense of million for the year ended september  relates primarily to the convertible subordinated notes 
interest expense of million in the prior year relates primarily to the convertible subordinated notes  and imputed interest on notes payable related to the e diagnostics and simcon acquisitions 
the notes issued for these acquisitions were settled on july  and may   respectively 
other income expense other expense increased by million  to million  in the year ended september   from million the previous year 
we incurred losses as a result of the disposal of the shinsung warrants and shares in the amount of million and million  respectively 
income tax provision benefit we recorded a net income tax provision of million in the year ended september  and net income tax provision of million in the year ended september  the tax provision recorded in fiscal is primarily due to foreign withholding taxes 
the tax provision recorded in fiscal is primarily due to the recording of a valuation allowance when we determined that deferred tax assets were not more likely than not to be realizable 
year ended september   compared to year ended september  we reported a net loss of million in the year ended september   compared to a net loss of million in the previous year 
the results for the year ended september  include charges of million for the ratable amortization of acquired intangible assets  million for the impairment of identifiable intangible assets and million for the impairment of goodwill associated with our acquisitions  million for the write down of the value of our net deferred tax asset  million of 
table of contents restructuring and acquisition related charges and million of other charges 
these other charges include million recorded to cost of product revenues  million recorded to research and development expense and million recorded to selling  general and administrative expense 
the charge to cost of product revenues is comprised of million for valuation adjustments to inventories  million for additional warranty reserves  million for loss reserves on acquired contracts  million for the write down of an obsolete tool used in our manufacturing process and million for deferred compensation related to stock options granted to employees of acquired companies 
the charge to research and development represents deferred compensation related to stock options granted to employees of acquired companies 
the charge to selling  general and administrative expense is comprised of million for deferred compensation related to stock options granted to employees of acquired companies and million of executive severance accruals 
the results for the year ended september  include million of amortization of acquired intangible assets and goodwill  million of restructuring and acquisition related charges and million of other charges 
these other charges  recorded in the fourth quarter  include million recorded to cost of product revenues  comprised of million for valuation adjustments to inventories and million for additional warranty reserves  million of accelerated amortization of research and development expense  and million of sales  general and administrative expense for additional accounts receivable allowances 
because of the significant decline in revenues in fiscal  and the fourth quarter expectation of a continuation of depressed demand in the first half of fiscal  we projected additional shortfalls in the expected usage of certain inventories and recorded the resulting charges in the fourth quarter of fiscal the reserves for excess and obsolete inventories included million and million in fiscal and  respectively  for non cancelable purchase order obligations for items deemed excess or obsolete 
the inventory affected was across several hardware product lines in the equipment automation and factory automation hardware segments 
during this process  we reviewed all open purchase orders with the affected vendors across our various segments and cancelled orders where possible 
we had provided million in the first three quarters of both fiscal and  as a result of the periodic reviews of obsolete and excess inventory that we performed 
during fiscal  we experienced a continued deterioration across both our end user and oem customer base in our receivable aging and a resultant increase in our days sales outstanding  driven by the overall slowdown in the industry 
we increased our reserves in fiscal against receivables due to collection issues caused by the slowdown 
during fiscal  we increased our emphasis on collection efforts  including higher staffing levels for collections  which resulted in a decrease in our day sales outstanding at september  accordingly  no additional increase to reserves was required 
it has been our practice to also discuss certain of our financial measures and results excluding certain acquisition related  restructuring and other charges 
these measures and results are not measures recognized under generally accepted accounting principles and may not be comparable to those of other companies 
we do not intend or suggest that you consider these alternative measures and results as indicators of operating performance 
we believe that presenting our operating results before taking into account such charges provides useful information to aid in understanding ongoing  recurring operations 
revenues we reported revenues of million for the year ended september   compared to million in the previous year  a decrease 
the decrease in revenues was principally attributable to the downturn in the semiconductor industry  partially offset by approximately million of incremental revenue from acquisitions consummated during fiscal our net revenues  excluding the impact of these acquisitions  decreased in the year ended september   compared to the prior year 
our equipment automation segment reported revenues of million in the year ended september   an increase of from the prior year 
this decrease was attributable to the continuing downturn in the semiconductor industry  partially offset by approximately million of incremental revenues from fiscal acquisitions 
these incremental revenues were primarily generated by the pri businesses acquired 
excluding these incremental revenues  the segment s revenues declined from the prior year 
our factory 
table of contents automation hardware segment reported a increase  to million  in the year ended september   compared to the previous year 
the increase was attributable to acquisitions completed during fiscal  which contributed approximately million to the segment s revenues 
excluding this incremental revenue  the segment s revenues declined from the prior year 
our factory automation software segment reported revenues of million  a decrease of from the prior year 
the decrease resulted from the downturn in the semiconductor industry was partially offset by approximately million of incremental revenues from fiscal acquisitions 
these incremental software revenues were principally generated by the pri businesses acquired 
excluding these incremental revenues  the segment s revenues declined  compared to the prior year 
product revenues decreased million  or  to million  in the year ended september   from million in the previous fiscal year 
this decrease was attributable to the continued slowdown in the semiconductor industry  which began to impact us during the second half of fiscal excluding the impact of acquisitions consummated during fiscal  product revenues decreased 
service revenues increased million  or  to million 
this increase was primarily attributable to our fiscal acquisitions 
excluding the impact of acquisitions consummated during fiscal  service revenues decreased revenues outside the united states were million  or of revenues  and million  or of revenues  in the years ended september  and  respectively 
gross margin gross margin decreased to for the year ended september   compared to for the previous year 
excluding other charges detailed above of million and million in the years ended september  and  respectively  gross margins were and  respectively 
the decrease was primarily attributable to lower revenue levels which were a result of the downturn which affected the semiconductor industry  coupled with the historically lower margin rates of several of our fiscal acquisitions 
lower revenue levels impact cost absorption  exerting downward pressure on gross margins 
our equipment automation segment gross margin decreased to in the year ended september   from in the prior year 
the decrease was primarily the result of product and customer mix  coupled with the effects of the continuing downturn in the semiconductor industry and the resultant impact of excess manufacturing capacity and lower margin rates of our acquired businesses 
gross margin for the our factory automation hardware segment decreased to in the year ended september   from in the prior year 
the decrease is the result of the acquisition of lower margin hardware businesses  coupled with reduced volume within existing business  which led to absorption variances 
our factory automation software segment s gross margin for the year ended september   decreased to  compared to in the prior year 
the change was primarily due to unfavorable product mix shifts between license and service revenues 
gross margin on product revenues was for the year ended september   compared to for the prior year 
excluding other charges aggregating million  gross margin on product revenues was for the year ended september  excluding other charges aggregating million  gross margin on product revenues was for the year ended september  the decrease in margin is primarily attributable to the effects of the continuing downturn in the semiconductor industry  causing lower absorption of manufacturing fixed costs 
gross margin on service revenues decreased to for the year ended september   from in the previous year 
the decrease was primarily a result of business mix  combined with the pricing pressure of the end user services business and the effects of the downturn in the semiconductor industry on our fixed cost absorption 
we performed cycle and year end inventory counts 
as a result of these counts  we recorded adjustments of million and million in fiscal and  respectively  to reduce the carrying value of our inventories 
included in the process of the physical count was the review of the useful life and expected benefits of utilizing demonstration equipment inventory 
as a result of this review  we recorded an adjustment 
table of contents of million for excess and idle demonstration equipment inventory in fiscal there was no charge for demonstration equipment arising in fiscal we accrued for warranty obligations related to our hardware products 
due to increased warranty return repair costs during the second half of the fiscal year and fiscal year of certain products under warranty  we determined that additional warranty reserves of million and million were required  and they were recorded in fiscal and  respectively 
we capitalized certain costs related to in house software development during the first half of fiscal consistent with statement of position  accounting for the costs of computer software developed for internal use sop 
consistent with sop  we performed a review at fiscal year end of the projects for which we capitalized costs 
based upon this review  particularly considering the industry slowdown in the second half of the year and the expected continuing slowdown  we determined that the related projects no longer provided us with incremental and substantial benefit and cancelled the projects 
as a result  million of capitalized costs were expensed in the year ended september  research and development research and development expenses for the year ended september   were million  an increase of million  compared to million in the previous year 
research and development expenses also increased as a percentage of revenues  to  from in the prior year 
excluding other charges of million  research and development expenses were of revenues in fiscal excluding other charges of million  research and development expenses were of revenues in the fiscal the increase in absolute spending was the result of the research and development related to our acquisitions as well as incremental spending associated with the launch of new products 
the increase in these expenditures as a percentage of revenues was primarily attributable to the downturn that continues to affect the semiconductor industry  which began to impact us during the quarterly period ended june  selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended september   an increase of million  compared to million in the prior year

amortization of acquired intangible assets and impairment charges amortization expense and impairment charges for acquired intangible assets and goodwill totaled million for the year ended september   and are comprised of million and million of impairment charges of our identifiable intangible assets and goodwill  respectively  and million of ratable amortization of acquired intangible assets from prior acquisitions 
we adopted fas on october  and accordingly  we ceased the ratable amortization of goodwill 
amortization expense for goodwill and assembled workforces was million in the year ended september  for the year ended september   amortization expense for acquired intangible assets was million  and relates to acquisitions prior to and during fiscal acquisition related and restructuring costs we recorded a charge to operations of million in the year ended september   of which million related to acquisitions and aborted acquisitions and million to restructuring costs as 
table of contents detailed above 
the acquisition costs were comprised of million related to the vesting by our chief executive officer in certain incremental retirement benefits upon the closing of the acquisition of pri on may   million to write off loans to aborted acquisition targets that management determined are no longer collectible and million of other costs 
we recorded million of acquisition related and restructuring charges during the year ended september   comprised of million of acquisition related costs and million of restructuring charges 
the acquisition related costs relate to transaction costs  principally legal  accounting and investment banking fees incurred for the acquisition of pti 
interest income and expense interest income decreased by million  to million  in the year ended september   from million the previous year 
this decrease was due primarily to lower cash balances available for investment 
interest expense of million for the year ended september   related primarily to the convertible subordinated notes  and imputed interest on notes payable related to the e diagnostics and simcon acquisitions 
the notes issued for these acquisitions were settled on july  and may   respectively 
interest expense of million in the prior year related primarily to the convertible subordinated notes  imputed interest on the notes payable for the e diagnostics and simcon acquisitions and the our note payable to daifuku america in connection with the acquisition of asc and asi  which was discharged on january  income tax provision benefit we recorded a net income tax provision of million in the year ended september  and net income tax benefit of million in the year ended september  the tax provision recorded in fiscal is primarily due to the recording of a valuation allowance 
we determined that the realization of our deferred tax assets was not likely 
the tax benefit recorded in fiscal is primarily due to anticipated future tax benefit of domestic net operating losses and research and development credits  partially offset by provisions for taxes on overseas earnings 
liquidity and capital resources we have recorded significant losses from operations and have an accumulated deficit of million at september  revenues and income from operations have decreased substantially and net cash outflows from operations have increased significantly as a result of the current downturn within the semiconductor sector and related industries 
consequently  we have undertaken several restructuring programs during the year ended september  to align our cost structures and our revenues 
these actions follow a series of similar efforts conducted in the year ended september   which were insufficient 
the cyclical nature of the industry  the extended period of the recent downturn and the current uncertainty as to the timing and speed of recovery make estimates of future revenues  results of revenues  results of operations and net cash flows inherently uncertain 
at september   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities aggregating million 
this amount was comprised of million of cash and cash equivalents  million of investments in short term marketable securities and million of investments in long term marketable securities 
at september   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities aggregating million 
this amount was comprised of million of cash and cash equivalents  million of investments in short term marketable securities and million of investments in long term marketable securities 
cash and cash equivalents were million at september   a decrease of million from september  this decrease in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to cash used in operations of million and capital expenditures of million 
these amounts were offset by million of net sales and maturities of marketable securities  million for proceeds primarily from the sale of shinsung common stock and warrants and million of net proceeds from the issuance of common stock 

table of contents cash used in operations was million for the year ended september   and was primarily attributable to our net loss of million  adjusted for depreciation and amortization of million  a charge for the impairment of fixed assets  long term assets and goodwill totaling million  compensation expense related to common stock options and stock based compensation expense of million  a decrease in accounts receivable of million and a decrease in inventories of million 
our days sales outstanding dso increased slightly to days at september   from days at september  maintaining this level is primarily attributable to our continued emphasis on collection efforts 
cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended september   and is principally comprised of net proceeds from sale of marketable securities of million and proceeds from the sale of long lived assets of million offset by million used for capital additions 
cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended september   and is primarily comprised of million from the issuance of stock under our employee stock purchase plan and the exercise of options to purchase our common stock 
on may   we completed the private placement of million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due in interest on the notes is paid on june and december of each year 
we made its first interest payment on december  the notes will mature on june  we may redeem the notes at stated premiums on or after june   or earlier if the price of our common stock reaches certain prices 
holders may require us to repurchase the notes upon a change in control of us in certain circumstances 
the notes are convertible at any time prior to maturity  at the option of the holders  into shares of our common stock  at a conversion price of per share  subject to certain adjustments 
the notes are subordinated to our senior indebtedness and structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries 
while we have no significant capital commitments  as we expand our product offerings  we anticipate that we will continue to make capital expenditures to support our business and improve our computer systems infrastructure 
we may also use our resources to acquire companies  technologies or products that complement our business 
at september   we had approximately million of an uncommitted demand promissory note facility still in use  all of it for letters of credit 
our contractual obligations consist of the following in thousands less than one to four to total one year three years five years thereafter contractual obligations operating leases continuing operating leases exited facilities debt interest on convertible subordinated notes total contractual obligations the table above does not include an accrual of million related to the projected retirement benefit to be paid to our chief executive officer under his current employment agreement 
the projected amount payable is earned over time and due immediately upon his retirement  however  at this time  his retirement date is not determinable 
his current employment agreement will expire on october  in april  we executed a tender offer the exchange program under which our employees excluding certain of our executive officers and the directors holding stock options awarded under our various stock option plans which have an exercise price equal to or in excess of per share the old options were permitted to exchange their old options for new options to purchase a smaller number of shares the 
table of contents new options 
under the exchange program  options to purchase  shares of common stock of participating employees were cancelled 
subsequently  on october   we issued new options to purchase  shares of common stock to those employees at an exercise price equal to  the market price of our common stock on that date 
as the new options were granted more than six months after the cancellation of the old options  no compensation expense was recorded related to the new issuance 
in conjunction with the exchange program we recognized million of compensation expense in the year ended september   related to unamortized deferred compensation for those options cancelled  which were originally granted to the employees of acquired companies 
we believe that our existing resources will be adequate to fund our currently planned working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  we used million to fund our operations for fiscal  and the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry makes it very difficult for us to predict future liquidity requirements with certainty 
we may be unable to obtain any required additional financing on terms favorable  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms  we may be unable to fund our expansion  successfully develop or enhance products  respond to competitive pressure or take advantage of acquisition opportunities  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb emerging issues task force released issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
eitf addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which it will perform multiple revenue generating activities 
eitf establishes three principles a revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting  b arrangement consideration should be allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values  and c revenue recognition criteria should be considered separately for separate units of accounting 
eitf is effective for all arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june   with early adoption permitted 
the adoption of eitf has not had any significant impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb fin 
the primary objectives of fin are to provide guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than through voting rights variable interest entities or vies and how to determine when and which business enterprise should consolidate the vie 
this new model for consolidation applies to an entity which either a the equity investors if any do not have a controlling financial interest  or b the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity s activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
in addition  fin requires that both the primary beneficiary and all other enterprises with a significant variable interest in a vie make additional disclosures 
in october  the fasb deferred the effective date for applying the provisions of fin to interests held in certain variable interest entities or potential variable interest entities until the end of the first interim or annual period ending after december  if the vie or potential vie was created before february  and the entity has not issued financial statements reporting that vie in accordance with fin  other than in certain disclosures required 
we do not expect the adoption of fin to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity fas  which establishes standards for how an issuer of financial instruments classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances if  at inception  the monetary value of the obligation is based solely or predominantly on a fixed monetary amount known at inception  variations in something other than the fair value of the issuer s equity shares or variations inversely related to changes in the fair value of the issuer s equity shares 
in november  the fasb deferred the classification and measurement provisions for certain mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interests for an indefinite period of time 
the instruments covered by this deferral would be redeemable only upon the liquidation or termination of the finite lived subsidiary and would apply to both existing and future 
table of contents arrangements 
for all other mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interests those that are a liability under fas to the subsidiary and also a liability when consolidated by the parent  only the measurement provisions relating to forward contracts are deferred for an indefinite period  if the security was created on or before november  for sec registrants  the disclosure provisions of fas are expected to apply without any deferral 
we will continue to evaluate the impact of fas on its financial position and results of operations 
factors that may affect future results you should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information in this report before deciding to invest in shares of our common stock 
these are the risks and uncertainties we believe are most important for you to consider 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us  which we currently deems immaterial or which are similar to those faced by other companies in our industry or business in general  may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks or uncertainties actually occur  our business  financial condition and operating results would likely suffer 
in that event  the market price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment 
risks relating to our industry due in part to the cyclical nature of the semiconductor manufacturing industry  we have recently incurred substantial operating losses and may have future losses 
our business is largely dependent on the semiconductor manufacturing industry and other businesses employing similar manufacturing technology 
in recent years  these businesses have experienced unpredictable and volatile business cycles due in large part to rapid changes in demand and manufacturing capacity for semiconductors 
the semiconductor industry has been in a prolonged downturn  which has negatively impacted us since the third quarter of fiscal as a result of the downturn  our oem and end user customers have significantly reduced the rate at which they purchase our products and services 
this reduced demand has adversely affected our sales volume and gross margins and has resulted in substantial operating losses during fiscal  and these losses are due to  among other things  writedowns for obsolete inventory and expenses related to investments in research and development and global service and support necessary to maintain our competitive position 
we may have future operating losses while the industry downturn and uncertain demand continues 
if the industry downturn continues for an extended period of time  our business could be materially harmed 
conversely  if demand improves unexpectedly  we may have insufficient inventory and manufacturing capacity to meet our customer needs on a timely basis  which could result in the loss of customers and various other expenses that could reduce gross margins and profitability 
we cannot assure you as to whether or when we will become profitable or whether we will be able to sustain such profitability  if achieved 
risks relating to brooks our operating results could fluctuate significantly  which could negatively impact our business 
our revenues  operating margins and other operating results could fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter depending upon a variety of factors  including demand for our products as a result of the cyclical nature of the semiconductor manufacturing industry or otherwise  changes in the timing and terms of product orders by our customers as a result of our customer concentration or otherwise  changes in the mix of products and services that we offer  timing and market acceptance of our new product introductions  
table of contents delays or problems in the planned introduction of new products  our competitors announcements of new products  services or technological innovations  which can  among other things  render our products less competitive due to the rapid technological change in our industry  the timing and related costs of any acquisitions  our ability to reduce our costs due to decreased demand for our products and services  disruptions in our manufacturing process or in the supply of components to us  write offs for excess or obsolete inventory  and competitive pricing pressures 
as a result of these risks  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our revenue and operating results may not be meaningful  and that these comparisons may not be an accurate indicator of our future performance 
if our quarterly results fluctuate significantly  our business could be harmed 
our restructuring activities and cost reduction measures may be insufficient to offset reduced demand for our products and may have materially harmed our business 
primarily in response to reduced demand for our products  during the recent downturn in the semiconductor industry  we implemented cost reductions and other restructuring activities throughout our organization 
these cost saving measures included several reductions in workforce  salary and wage reductions  reduced inventory levels  consolidation of certain of our manufacturing facilities to our chelmsford  massachusetts facilities and the discontinuation of certain product lines and information technology projects 
we cannot assure you that these cost reductions will be sufficient to offset the reduced sales levels we experienced during the downturn 
our failure to adequately reduce our costs  without a corresponding increase in demand for our products and sales level  could materially harm our business and prospects and our ability to maintain our competitive position 
our restructuring activities may have harmed us because they may have resulted in reduced productivity by our employees and increased difficulty in retaining and hiring a sufficient number of qualified employees familiar with our products and processes and the locales in which we operate 
delays and technical difficulties in our products and operations may result in lost revenue  lost profit  delayed or limited market acceptance or product liability claims 
as the technology in our systems and manufacturing operations has become more complex and customized  it has become increasingly difficult to design and integrate these technologies into our newly introduced systems  procure adequate supplies of specialized components  train technical and manufacturing personnel and make timely transitions to volume manufacturing 
due to the complexity of our manufacturing processes  we have on occasion failed to meet our customers delivery or performance criteria  and as a result we have deferred revenue recognition  incurred late delivery penalties and had higher warranty and service costs 
we cannot guarantee that we will not experience these problems in the future 
we may be unable to recover expenses we incur due to changes or cancellations of customized orders 
there are also substantial unanticipated costs associated with ensuring that new products function properly and reliably in the early stages of their life cycle 
these costs have been and could in the future be greater than expected as a result of these complexities 
our failure to control these costs could materially harm our business and profitability 
because many of our customers use our products for business critical applications  any errors  defects or other performance or technical problems could result in financial or other damage to our customers and could significantly impair their operations 
our customers could seek to recover damages from us for losses related to any of these issues 
a product liability claim brought against us  even if not successful  would likely be time consuming and costly to defend and could adversely affect our marketing efforts 

table of contents if we do not continue to introduce new products and services that reflect advances in technology in a timely manner  our products and services will become obsolete and our operating results will suffer 
our success is dependent on our ability to respond to the rapid rate of technological change present in the semiconductor manufacturing industry 
the success of our product introduction and development depends on our ability to accurately identify and define new market opportunities and products  obtain market acceptance of our products  such as onefab amhs  timely innovate  develop and commercialize new technologies and applications  adjust to changing market conditions  differentiate our offerings from our competitors offerings  continue to develop a comprehensive  integrated product and service strategy  and properly price our products and services 
if we cannot succeed in responding in a timely manner to technological and or market changes  we could lose our competitive position which could materially harm our business and our prospects 
our systems integration services business has grown significantly  and poor execution of that business could adversely affect our operating results 
the number of projects for our systems integration services business  which integrates our software and hardware products with products provided by our customers or others  has grown significantly 
we are in the early stages of developing this business 
accordingly  we are subject to the risks attendant to entering a business in which we have little direct experience 
due to complexities in this business  we may be unable to integrate our customers products with our software and hardware products in a cost effective and timely manner  which could adversely affect our operating results and materially harm our business 
our ability to succeed in this business and increase our revenues is further limited by our ability to retain  hire and train systems integration personnel 
we believe that there is significant competition for personnel with the advanced skills and technical knowledge that this business requires 
since some of our competitors may have greater resources to hire personnel with those skills and knowledge  our operating margins could be adversely affected if we cannot hire and train additional personnel or deliver integrated systems to our customers on a timely basis consistent with our budgets 
the global nature of our business exposes it to multiple risks 
for the year ended september   approximately of our revenues were derived from sales outside north america 
we expect that international sales  including increased sales in asia  will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues 
as a result of our international operations  we are exposed to many risks and uncertainties  including difficulties in staffing  managing and supporting operations in multiple countries  longer sales cycles and time to collection  tariff and international trade barriers  fewer legal protections for intellectual property and contract rights abroad  different and changing legal and regulatory requirements in the jurisdictions in which we operate  government currency control and restrictions on repatriation of earnings  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interest rates  and political and economic changes  hostilities and other disruptions in regions where we operate 

table of contents negative developments in any of these areas in one or more countries could result in a reduction in demand for our products  the cancellation or delay of orders already placed  threats to our intellectual property  difficulty in collecting receivables  and a higher cost of doing business  any of which could materially harm our business and profitability 
our business could be materially harmed if we fail to adequately integrate the operations of the businesses that we may acquire 
we have made in the past  and may make in the future  acquisitions or significant investments in businesses with complementary products  services and or technologies 
our acquisitions present numerous risks  including difficulties in integrating the operations  technologies  products and personnel of the acquired companies and realizing upon the anticipated synergies of the combined businesses  defining and executing a comprehensive product strategy  managing the risks of entering markets or types of businesses in which we have limited or no direct experience  the potential loss of key employees  customers and strategic partners of acquired companies  unanticipated problems or latent liabilities  such as problems with the quality of the installed base of the target company s products  problems associated with compliance with the target company s existing contracts  difficulties in managing geographically dispersed operations  and the diversion of management s attention from normal daily operations of the business 
if we acquire a new business  we may be required to expend significant funds  incur additional debt or issue additional securities  which may negatively affect our operations and be dilutive to our stockholders 
in periods following an acquisition  we will be required to evaluate goodwill and acquisition related intangible assets for impairment 
when such assets are found to be impaired  they will be written down to estimated fair value  with a charge against earnings 
for example  we were required to record impairment charges on acquired intangible assets and goodwill aggregating million in fiscal the failure to adequately address these risks could materially harm our business and financial results 
risks relating to our customers we face substantial competition which may lead to price pressure an otherwise adversely affect our sales 
we face substantial competition throughout the world in each of our product areas 
our primary competitors range from large companies such as asyst shinko  daifuku  hp compaq  ibm  murata  rorze  tdk and yaskawa to smaller  regional companies 
we also compete with oem manufacturers  such as applied materials  that satisfy their semiconductor and flat panel display handling needs internally rather than by purchasing systems or modules from a supplier like us 
some of our competitors have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive engineering  manufacturing  marketing and customer support capabilities than we do 
we expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products and technologies that could adversely affect sales of our current and future products and services 
new products and technologies developed by our competitors or more efficient production of their products could require us to make significant price reductions to avoid losing orders 
if we fail to respond adequately to pricing pressures or fail to develop products with improved performance or developments with respect to the other factors on which we compete  we could lose customers or orders 
if we are unable to compete effectively  our business and prospects could be materially harmed 

table of contents because we rely on a limited number of customers for a large portion of our revenues  the loss of one or more of these customers could materially harm our business 
we receive a significant portion of our revenues in each fiscal period from a relatively limited number of customers  and that trend is likely to continue 
sales to our ten largest customers accounted for approximately of our total revenues in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal as the semiconductor manufacturing industry continues to consolidate and further shifts to foundries which manufacture semiconductors designed by others  the number of our potential customers could decrease  which would increase our dependence on our limited number of customers 
the loss of one or more of these major customers or a decrease in orders from one of these customers could materially affect our revenue  business and reputation 
because of the lengthy sales cycles of many of our products  we may incur significant expenses before we generate any revenues related to those products 
our customers may need several months to test and evaluate our products 
this increases the possibility that a customer may decide to cancel or change plans  which could reduce or eliminate our sales to that customer 
as a result of this lengthy sales cycle  we may incur significant research and development expenses  and selling  general and administrative expenses before we generate the related revenues for these products  and we may never generate the anticipated revenues if a customer cancels or changes its plans 
in addition  many of our products will not be sold directly to the end user but will be components of other products 
as a result  we rely on oems of our products to select our products from among alternative offerings to be incorporated into their equipment at the design stage  so called design ins 
the oem s decisions often precede the generation of volume sales  if any  by a year or more 
moreover  if we are unable to achieve these design ins from oems  we would have difficulty selling our products to that oem because changing suppliers involves significant cost  time  effort and risk on the part of that oem 
customers do not make long term commitments to purchase our products and our customers may cease purchasing our products at any time 
sales of our products are often made pursuant to individual purchase orders and not under long term commitments and contracts 
our customers frequently do not provide any assurance of minimum or future sales and are not prohibited from purchasing products from our competitors at any time 
accordingly  we are exposed to competitive pricing pressures on each order 
our customers also engage in the practice of purchasing products from more than one manufacturer to avoid dependence on sole source suppliers for certain of their needs 
the existence of these practices makes it more difficult for us to gain new customers and to win repeat business from existing customers 
other risks we may be subject to claims of infringement of third party intellectual property rights  or demands that we license third party technology  which could result in significant expense and prevent us from using our technology 
we rely upon patents  trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures  copyrights  trademarks and licensing agreements to protect our technology 
due to the rapid technological change that characterizes the semiconductor and flat panel display process equipment industries  we believe that the improvement of existing technology  reliance upon trade secrets and unpatented proprietary know how and the development of new products may be as important as patent protection in establishing and maintaining competitive advantage 
to protect trade secrets and know how  it is our policy to require all technical and management personnel to enter into nondisclosure agreements 
we cannot guarantee that these efforts will meaningfully protect our trade secrets 
there has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the semiconductor related industries 
we have in the past been  and may in the future be  notified that we may be 
table of contents infringing intellectual property rights possessed by other third parties 
we cannot guarantee that infringement claims by third parties or other claims for indemnification by customers or end users of our products resulting from infringement claims will not be asserted in the future or that such assertions  if proven to be true  will not materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
particular elements of our technology could be found to infringe on the intellectual property rights or patents of others 
other companies may hold or obtain patents on inventions or otherwise claim proprietary rights to technology necessary to our business 
for example  twice in and once in we received notice from general signal corporation that it believed that certain of our tool automation products infringed general signal s patent rights 
we believe the matters identified in the notice from general signal were also the subject of a dispute between general signal and applied materials  inc  which was settled in november there are also claims that have been made by asyst technologies inc that certain products we acquired through acquisition embody intellectual property owned by asyst 
to date no action has been instituted against us directly by general signal  applied materials or asyst 
we cannot predict the extent to which we might be required to seek licenses or alter our products so that they no longer infringe the rights of others 
we also cannot guarantee that the terms of any licenses we may be required to seek will be reasonable 
similarly  changing our products or processes to avoid infringing the rights of others may be costly or impractical and could detract from the value of our products 
if a judgment of infringement were obtained against us  we could be required to pay substantial damages and a court could issue an order preventing us from selling one or more of our products 
further the cost and diversion of management attention brought about by such litigation could be substantial  even if we were to prevail 
any of these events could result in significant expense to us and may materially harm our business and our prospects 
our failure to protect our intellectual property could adversely affect our future operations 
our ability to compete is significantly affected by our ability to protect our intellectual property 
existing trade secret  trademark and copyright laws offer only limited protection  and certain of our patents could be invalidated or circumvented 
in addition  the laws of some countries in which our products are or may be developed  manufactured or sold may not fully protect our products 
we cannot guarantee that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property will be adequate to prevent the misappropriation of our technology 
other companies could independently develop similar or superior technology without violating our intellectual property rights 
in the future  it may be necessary to engage in litigation or like activities to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others  including our customers 
this could require us to incur significant expenses and to divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from our business operations 
if the site of the majority of our manufacturing operations were to experience a significant disruption in operations  our business could be materially harmed 
most of our manufacturing facilities are concentrated in one location 
if the operations of these facilities were disrupted as a result of a natural disaster  fire  power or other utility outage  work stoppage or other similar event  our business could be seriously harmed because we may be unable to manufacture and ship products and parts to our customers in a timely fashion 
our business could be materially harmed if one or more key suppliers fail to deliver key components 
we currently obtain many of our key components on an as needed  purchase order basis from numerous suppliers 
we do not generally have long term supply contracts with these suppliers  and many of them have undertaken cost containment measures in light of the recent downturn in the semiconductor industry 
in the event of an industry upturn these suppliers could face significant challenges in delivering components on a timely basis 
our inability to obtain components in required quantities or of acceptable quality could result in delays or reductions in product shipments to our customers 
this could cause us to lose customers  result in delayed or lost revenue and otherwise materially harm our business 

table of contents our stock price is volatile 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated widely 
for example  between may  and september   the closing price of our common stock dropped from approximately to per share and between april  and september   the price of our common stock rose from approximately to per share 
the market price of our common stock reached a low of approximately on april  consequently  the current market price of our common stock may not be indicative of future market prices  and we may be unable to sustain or increase the value of an investment in our common stock 
factors affecting our stock price may include variations in operating results from quarter to quarter  changes in earnings estimates by analysts or our failure to meet analysts expectations  changes in the market price per share of our public company customers  market conditions in the industry  general economic conditions  political changes  hostilities or health risks such as sars  low trading volume of our common stock  and the number of firms making a market in our common stock 
in addition  the stock market has recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
these fluctuations have particularly affected the market prices of the securities of high technology companies like ours 
these market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
provisions in our organizational documents  contracts and convertible subordinated notes due may make it difficult for someone to acquire control of the us 
our certificate of incorporation  bylaws  contracts and convertible subordinated notes due contain provisions that would make more difficult an acquisition of control of us and could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for our securities  including the ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series without further authorization of stockholders  a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent  the elimination of the right of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders  a requirement that stockholders provide advance notice of any stockholder nominations of directors to be considered at any meeting of stockholders  a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least percent of our shares be obtained for certain actions requiring the vote of our stockholders  a requirement under our shareholder rights plan that  in many potential takeover situations  rights issued under the plan become exercisable to purchase our common stock at a price substantially discounted from the then applicable market price of our common stock  and a requirement upon specified types of change of control that we repurchase the convertible subordinated notes at a price equal to of the principal outstanding amount thereof  plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate exposure at september   we had no variable interest rate debt  accordingly  a change in the effective interest rate percentage would not materially affect the consolidated results of operations or financial position 
currency rate exposure our foreign revenues are generally denominated in united states dollars 
accordingly  foreign currency fluctuations have not had a significant impact on the comparison of the results of operations for the periods presented 
the costs and expenses of our international subsidiaries are generally denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar 
however  since the functional currency of our international subsidiaries is the local currency  foreign currency translation adjustments do not impact operating results  but instead are reflected as a component of stockholders equity under the caption accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
to the extent that we expand our international operations or change our pricing practices to denominate prices in foreign currencies  we will be exposed to increased risk of currency fluctuation 
assets and liabilities of our international subsidiaries are translated at period end exchange rates 
as such  foreign currency fluctuation results in increases and decreases in translated foreign currency assets and liabilities with the resulting offset being reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income loss
