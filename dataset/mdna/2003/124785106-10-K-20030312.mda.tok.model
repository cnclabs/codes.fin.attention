item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains statements relating to future results of the company including certain projections and business trends that are considered forward looking statements 
actual results may differ materially from those projected as a result of certain risks and uncertainties including  but not limited to  changes in political and economic conditions  interest rate fluctuations  competitive product and pricing pressures within the company s market  equity and bond market fluctuations  personal and corporate customers bankruptcies and financial condition  inflation and results of litigation 
accordingly  historical performance  as well as reasonably applied projections and assumptions  may not be a reliable indicator of future earnings due to risks and uncertainties 
as circumstances  conditions or events change that affect the company s assumptions and projections on which any of the statements are based  the company disclaims any obligation to issue any update or revision to any forward looking statement contained herein 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to its investments  loans and allowance for loan losses  intangible assets  income taxes  contingencies  and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on current market conditions  historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies require significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
allowance for credit losses 
the allowance for credit losses is periodically evaluated for adequacy by management 
factors considered include the company s loan loss experience  known and inherent risks in the portfolio  current economic conditions  known adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  regulatory policies  and the estimated value of underlying collateral 
the evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is based on the above factors along with prevailing and anticipated economic conditions that may impact borrowers ability to repay loans 
determination of the allowance is in part objective and in part a subjective judgment by management given the information it currently has in its possession 
adverse changes in any of these factors or the discovery of new adverse information could result in higher charge offs and loan loss provisions 
impairment of investments 
the realization of the company s investment in certain mortgage asset backed securities and collateralized loan and bond obligations is dependent on the credit quality of the underlying borrowers and yields demanded by the marketplace 
increases in market interest rates and deteriorating credit quality of the underlying borrowers because of adverse conditions may result in additional losses 
the company records an investment impairment charge when it believes an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
since the collateralized loan and bond obligations do not have a liquid trading market  management s estimate of value is based upon estimates of future returns that may or may not actually be realized 
accordingly  under different assumptions  the value could be adversely affected 
as of december   approximately million of these investments were carried on the books of the company 
deferred tax assets 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized 
this requires an objective as well as a subjective judgment by management 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made

in these evaluations  management considers numerous factors including  but not limited to  global  national and local economic conditions  loan portfolio composition  loan loss experience and management s estimate of potential losses 
these various analyses lead to a determination of the amount needed in the allowance for credit losses 
to the extent the existing allowance is below the amount so determined  a provision is made that will bring the allowance to such amount 
thus  the provision for credit losses may fluctuate and may not be comparable from year to year

the hawaii economy was emerging from a decade long recession when the events of september  occurred  significantly affecting the travel and tourism industry upon which hawaii is very dependent 
with the continued global instability and geopolitical issues in the middle east and asia  the hawaii economy and many businesses are vulnerable to another economic downturn 
management believes that the higher provision for loan losses in is appropriate given the charge off level and the continued uncertainty of the local  national and global economies 
total charge offs were million in  an increase of  over the million in installment and consumer charge offs and recoveries increased by million and million  respectively  in over the increases were primarily related to charge off and recoveries in a certain sector of the dealer and automobile financing market

the net investment in loans that are considered to be impaired was million at december   a decrease of million from the million at december  additional information on impaired loans is presented in note d of notes to the company s consolidated financial statements 
in management s judgment  the allowance for credit losses was adequate to absorb potential losses currently inherent in the loan portfolio at december  however  changes in prevailing economic conditions in the company s markets or in the financial condition of its customers could alter the level of nonperforming assets and charge offs in the future and  accordingly  affect the allowance for credit losses

advances from the fhlb were made under a credit line agreement providing for advances up to million  of which million was undrawn at december  see notes h and i of notes to the company s consolidated financial statements 
at december   there were nine long term fhlb advances totaling million  callable between february and august financial condition total assets at december  were  million  an increase of million  or  from the increase was due primarily to increases in cash  fed funds sold  and investments of million  or  million  or  and million  or  respectively 
these increases were a result of cash flows generated from a decrease in loans of million  or  an increase in deposits of million  or  and an increase in borrowings of million  or 
liquidity management the primary objective of liquidity management is to maintain a balance between sources and uses of funds in order that the cash flow needs of the company are met in the most economical and expedient manner 
the liquidity needs of a financial institution require the availability of cash to meet the withdrawal demands of depositors and the credit commitments of borrowers 
in order to optimize liquidity  management monitors and forecasts the various sources and uses of funds in an effort to continually meet the financial requirements of the company and the financial needs of its customer base 
to ensure liquidity on a short term basis  the company s primary sources are cash or cash equivalents  loan repayments  proceeds from the sale of assets available for sale  increases in deposits  proceeds from maturing securities and  when necessary  federal funds purchased  brokered deposits and credit arrangements with correspondent banks and the fhlb 
maturities of investment securities are also structured to cover large commitments and seasonal fluctuations in credit arrangements 
at december   the company had advances outstanding from the fhlb of million of total liabilities compared to million of total liabilities at december  the maximum amount of advances from the fhlb that the company had outstanding at any month end during such periods was million 
as of december   the bank had available unused credit lines of million from the fhlb 
during  million of short term and million of long term borrowings from the fhlb mature see note i of notes to the company s consolidated financial statements for future maturity of long term borrowings from the fhlb 
it has been the company s general practice to satisfy maturing obligations to the fhlb in part by additional advances under its credit line agreement with the fhlb 
the creditline agreements have standard fhlb default provisions which  among other matters  accelerate the maturity date if there is a material adverse change to the financial condition of the bank and or if repayment ability becomes impaired 
the company s ability to continue to draw upon this credit line and avoid an acceleration of the maturity dates is dependent upon the company s continued adequate financial condition and fulfillment of collateral requirements 
as of december   these borrowings were collateralized by million in us treasuries and agencies and loans 
in the remote case that the fhlb ceases to make advances available as a reliable source of liquidity  the company would be required to repay the advances as they mature or are accelerated from other sources of funds in order to mitigate the risk that the security pledged as collateral for the advances might be realized upon by the fhlb 
management believes that the company could obtain other sources of funding  such as through repurchase agreements  brokered cds  federal fund lines with other correspondent banks or lines of credit with the federal reserve system in order to meet such repayment requirements 

table of contents the consolidated statements of cash flows identify three major sources and uses of cash as operating  investing and financing activities

effects of inflation the financial statements and related data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset liability management and interest rate sensitivity market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from adverse changes in market rates prices such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the company s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
the ongoing monitoring and management of this risk is an important component of the company s asset liability management process which is governed by policies established by its board of directors that are reviewed and approved annually 
the board of directors delegates responsibility for carrying out the asset liability management policies to the asset liability committee alco 
in this capacity  alco develops guidelines and strategies impacting the company s asset liability management related activities based upon estimated market risk sensitivity  policy limits and overall market interest rate levels and trends 
the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring an institution s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets 
during a period of falling interest rates  the net earnings of an institution with a positive gap theoretically may be adversely affected due to its interest earning assets repricing to a greater extent than its interest bearing liabilities 
conversely  during a period of rising interest rates  theoretically  the net earnings of an institution with a positive gap position may increase as it is able to invest in higher yielding interest earning assets at a more rapid rate than its interest bearing liabilities reprice 
the company also measures and monitors its sensitivity to interest rates using net interest income simulations on a quarterly basis 
any identified exposure is managed primarily through the use of derivative instruments that have been designated and have qualified as either cash flow hedging instruments such as swaps  caps and floors or fair value hedging instruments such as options 
additionally  the company extends or shortens the duration of the investment and mortgage asset backed securities portfolio  retail certificates of deposit and fhlb advances 
the company currently does not engage in the use of trading activities  high risk derivatives and synthetic instruments in controlling its interest rate risk 
such uses are permitted at the recommendation of alco with the approval of the board of directors 
the following table sets forth the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december   which are anticipated by the company  based upon certain assumptions  to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown 
except as stated below  the amounts of assets and liabilities shown which reprice or mature during a particular period were determined in accordance with the earlier of the term to repricing or the contractual terms of the asset or liability 
since all interest rates and yields do not adjust at the same velocity or magnitude  and since volatility is subject to change  the gap is only a general indicator of interest rate sensitivity

in connection with these asset and liability management objectives  various actions have been taken  including changes in the composition of assets and liabilities  and the use of financial instruments 

table of contents when appropriate  alco may utilize off balance sheet instruments such as interest rate floors  caps and swaps to hedge its interest rate risk position 
a board of directors approved hedging policy statement governs the use of these instruments 
the financial instruments used and their notional amounts outstanding at december for the years indicated were as follows dollars in thousands interest rate swaps pay floating swaps notional amount average receive rate average pay rate pay fixed swaps notional amount average receive rate average pay rate under interest rate swaps  the company agrees with other parties to exchange  at specified intervals  the difference between fixed rate and floating rate interest amounts calculated by reference to the agreed notional amount 
interest rate contracts are primarily used to convert certain deposits and long term debt to fixed interest rates or to convert certain groups of customer loans and other interest earning assets to fixed rates 
certain interest rate swaps specifically match the amounts and terms of particular assets and liabilities 
interest rate options  which primarily consist of caps and floors  are interest rate protection instruments that involve the payment from the seller to the buyer of an interest rate differential in exchange for a premium paid by the buyer 
this differential represents the difference between current interest rates and an agreed upon rate applied to a notional amount 
interest rate caps limit the cap holder s risk associated with an increase in interest rates 
interest rate floors limit the risk associated with a decline in interest rates 
the company has a mortgage banking operation and thus holds a portfolio of residential loans funded  pending sale to investors 
these loans were million and million at december  and  respectively  and are carried on the books at the lower of cost or market 
because the market value of these loans are subject to change due to interest rates  the company utilizes forward sales and short call options to protect against rising rates 
interest rate options at december   and consisted of the following notional estimated fair notional estimated fair notional estimated fair in thousands amount value amount value amount value caps nil  nil  options total interest rate options interest rate risk interest rate risk represents the sensitivity of earnings to changes in market interest rates 
as interest rates change  the interest income and expense streams associated with the company s financial instruments also change thereby impacting net interest income nii  the primary component of the company s earnings 
alco utilizes the results of a detailed and dynamic simulation model to quantify the estimated exposure of nii to sustained interest rate changes 
while alco routinely monitors simulated nii sensitivity over a rolling two year horizon  it also utilizes additional tools to monitor potential longer term interest rate risk 
based on the results of the simulation model and interest rate risk position  management monitors short and long term exposure to market risk by managing rates paid on liabilities  pricing on loans  volumes of loans  deposits and investments  mix of asset types varying in term  optionality and cash flow characteristics  and other factors 
these tactics are employed considering market conditions  competition  loan demand and customer preferences 
a unique aspect of the bank s earning asset base is that of total gross loans are residential mortgage loans  which have longer terms and greater option risk arising from the borrower s right to prepay 
this potentially creates significant mismatch risk as funding of those assets are typically at terms much shorter than the expected terms of the loans 
as a result  the bank has generally been liability sensitive in the past 
due to the presence of an established secondary market for residential real estate loans and its acceptance as collateral for wholesale borrowing for the bank  this portfolio and continuing operation is a significant source of liquidity  regardless of the interest rate environment 
over the last year  the bank s interest rate position has shifted from liability sensitive to asset sensitive 
in this low rate environment  the bank was affected by higher prepayments  resulting in rapid runoff of the residential mortgage loan portfolio 
the cash flows from these longer term assets as well as mortgage backed securities which behave similarly to residential mortgages  were redeployed in loans and investments that were either floating or have shorter fixed terms to years 
additionally  management extended maturities of borrowings and also executed interest rate swaps where the bank paid fixed for terms ranging from to years to lock in funding costs in this low rate environment 
these activities resulted in the balance sheet becoming asset sensitive and  therefore  positively exposed to potential upward movement in interest rates 

table of contents the simulation model captures the impact of changing interest rates on the interest income received and interest expense paid on all assets and liabilities reflected on the company s balance sheet as well as for off balance sheet derivative financial instruments 
this sensitivity analysis is compared to alco policy limits which specify a maximum tolerance level for nii exposure over a one year horizon  assuming no balance sheet growth  given both a basis point bp upward and bp downward shift in interest rates 
a parallel and pro rata shift in rates over a month period is assumed 
the following reflects the company s nii sensitivity analysis as of december  rate change estimated nii sensitivity bp bp the preceding sensitivity analysis does not represent a company forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results 
these hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions including the nature and timing of interest rate levels including yield curve shape  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit decay rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment replacement of asset and liability cashflows  and others 
while assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  the company cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change 
also  as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis  actual results will differ due to prepayment refinancing levels likely deviating from those assumed  the varying impact of interest rate change  caps or floors on adjustable rate assets  the potential effect of changing debt service levels on customers with adjustable rate loans  depositor early withdrawals and product preference changes  and other internal external variables 
furthermore  the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that alco might take in responding to or anticipating changes in interest rates
