the company acquired gold ranch in june  as such  it is difficult to draw meaningful conclusions from prior year comparisons for revenues  expenses  and operating margins 
comparing one month to a full year is particularly difficult because of seasonality factors 
in general  good weather means more travelers on interstate and higher revenues for the gold ranch 
however  gold ranch and reno area promotions and special events  the timing of holiday weekends  the size of the california lottery jackpot  and the price of gasoline can all significantly impact gold ranch customer counts 
total net revenues for gold ranch were million for the year ended june   as compared with net revenues of million in the one month of operation in the year ended june  the highest revenue component at the gold ranch property is the high volume arco gas station and convenience store

the copa ownership has upgraded the property extensively and the company feels it has perfected a lien on the newly revitalized property 
based on the new terms and recent payments  it will take between years to collect fully on the note  however  as of the date of this report  the company continues to believe that the risks facing the current ownership of the copa has not materially changed  and continues to record gains only as payments are received

both tournaments start in mid winter and last for nearly months 
while the non bowling fiscal year was expected and planned for  two major events which impacted the reno tourism industry were not 
the events of september cancelled the very popular reno national air race championship and materially impacted other special events 
additionally  its effect on hotel occupancy was felt throughout the rest of fiscal results could have been worse if the company had not changed its marketing strategy and repositioned itself so that an increasing number of our guests are drive ups from northern california and local reno residents 
these revenue sources were least affected by the september tragedy 
further  the company s results  along with the reno area in general  were negatively impacted by the soft economy in northern california 
the energy crisis  coupled with the technology slump  severely impacted the northern california economy  which is the company s primary feeder market 
the company attempted to mitigate the impact of these events by aggressively marketing to energy cost sensitive californians

over new slot machines were installed during the year revitalizing the products offered and enhancing the selection 
additionally  the company installed international game technology s latest slot ticketing system ez pay integrated voucher system and upgraded its player tracking system acres gaming s advantage 
ez pay is a coin free slot machine which significantly reduces slot machine downtime and operating expenses

in other gaming areas  comparisons of fiscal to were mixed 
bingo traffic is a critical component in the company s pursuit of local gaming patrons

gold ranch s slot machines and lottery station contributed  to gaming revenues in fiscal during its one month of operation after acquisition 
food and beverage revenues increased  to million in fiscal beverage revenue increased  even though volume decreased  as the interdepartmental pricing of complimentary beverages was increased to more closely align beverage complimentary pricing with the pricing of cash beverages 
the effect of changing the interdepartmental pricing of complimentary beverages on net revenues is zero  as complimentary goods and services provided to guests are netted from gross revenues to arrive at net revenues

costs per occupied room decreased as well  from in fiscal to in fiscal the decreased cost per occupied room was primarily due to significant cost savings realized following the acquisition of several pieces of new or refurbished laundry equipment 
maintenance and utility costs increased  to million for fiscal  from million in the prior year 
increased utility costs accounted for all of the change  as both the price per kilowatt and price per thermal unit increased substantially 
in fiscal  the company began installing energy saving lighting fixtures to keep overall costs low and to reduce exposure to future rate increases 
general and administrative expenses remained relatively stable with a  increase to million in fiscal from million in the prior year

in fiscal  the company chose not to put its cash balances at risk  thus it experienced modest  but positive returns 
interest expense increased materially from million to million as the company expensed  of unamortized deferred loan fees from the million in long term debt that was refinanced 
seasonality as is true for other hotel casinos in the reno area  demand for the company s facilities declines in the winter 
due to lower room rates and a lower level of gaming play per occupied room  operating margins and  to a lesser extent  revenues are lower during our second and third fiscal quarters 
to attempt to counter this seasonality  the company has pursued local gaming business which is not subject to as great a decline in winter months as the tourism business

the expansion of native american casinos in california  oregon  and washington continues to have an impact on casino revenues in nevada in general  and some analysts have predicted the impact will be significant on the reno tahoe market 
thunder valley casino  a large new native american casino operated by station casinos  inc  opened june   miles west of reno in rocklin  california 
the impact to the company of this native american casino and others is difficult to predict

downtown reno railroad trench 
work has begun on a project to build a trench through downtown reno for the purpose of constructing a below grade rail transport corridor 
known as retrac reno transportation railroad access corridor the project is anticipated to take between years to be completed 
currently  union pacific s railroad tracks dissect downtown reno  as well as the sands regency s parking facilities 
retrac has temporarily taken nearly of the sands parking spaces to build an interim railroad track known as the shoo fly 
the company has also been informed a small number of parking spaces and sands pedestrian overpass structure will be permanently lost 
the law requires that the sands be given alternate parking or compensation for spaces and structures permanently or temporarily lost due to the project 
in july  the sands received compensation amounting to approximately  for its contribution to the project 
the company feels it may not have been compensated fully  and has given up none of its rights for recourse 
negotiations are continuing for a replacement bridge and additional parking  and as of the date of this report  the company is carefully monitoring the situation  and analyzing and reviewing its alternatives 
the effect of trench construction on downtown reno s business levels  and specifically the business levels of the sands  is hard to quantify  as any potential downside due to customer inconvenience could be somewhat offset by opportunities  such as the effect this major construction project will have on the reno area economy 
in light of these uncertainties  the company feels no assurance can be given that this project will not have an adverse material impact on the business levels of its downtown reno property
