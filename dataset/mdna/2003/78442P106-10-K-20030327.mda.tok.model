item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations years ended december  dollars in millions  except per share amounts overview the company is the largest private source of funding  delivery and servicing support for education loans in the united states primarily through its participation in the federal family education loan program ffelp 
the company provides a wide range of financial services  processing capabilities and information technology to meet the needs of educational institutions  lenders  students and their families  and guarantee agencies 
the company s primary business is to originate and hold student loans  but the company also provides fee based student loan related products and services and earns servicing fees for student loan servicing and guarantee processing  and student loan default management and loan collections 
slm corporation is a holding company that operates through a number of subsidiaries including student loan marketing association  a federally chartered government sponsored enterprise the gse 
references herein to the company refer to slm corporation and its subsidiaries 
our results can be materially affected by changes in applicable laws and regulations  which may change the volume  average term and effective yields of student loans under the ffelp or result in loans being originated or refinanced under non ffelp programs or may affect the terms upon which banks and others agree to sell ffelp loans to the company  the demand for education financing  the competition for education financing  the financing preferences of students and their families  the general interest rate environment and credit spreads  the funding spreads on our non gse financing activities  prepayment rates on student loans  including prepayments through loan consolidation  the securitization market for fixed income securities backed by education loans  either by increasing the costs or limiting the availability of financing  and borrower default rates 
the majority of our student loan purchases and on balance sheet financing of student loans occurs in the gse 
we finance such purchases through the issuance of gse debt obligations and through student loan securitizations 
in a securitization  we sell student loans from the gse to a trust that issues bonds backed by the student loans as part of the transaction 
once securitized  the gse no longer owns the student loans and the bonds issued by the trust are not obligations of the gse 
in  we transferred all personnel and certain assets of the gse to the company or other non gse affiliates and  as a consequence  the operations of the gse are managed by us through a management services agreement 
we will continue to transfer the gse s assets throughout the wind down period 
we also service the majority of the gse s student loans under a servicing agreement between the gse and sallie mae servicing  lp 
all student loans that we originate on our behalf are owned by non gse subsidiaries of the company from inception 
we have provided the discussion of the gse within the context of this md a because a substantial portion of the company s operations is conducted through the gse 
md a disclosures applicable solely to the gse are included at the end of this md a in the section titled student loan marketing association 
the discussion that follows regarding our interest income and expenses from on balance sheet assets and liabilities is applicable to both the company and the gse 
likewise  because all of our ffelp securitizations to date have originated from the gse  the discussion of the securitization gains and securitization revenue is applicable to both the company and the gse 
on the other hand  the discussions of our off balance sheet loans  our fee based businesses  and our operations on a managed basis  as well as the discussions set forth below under the headings  selected financial data  other income  federal and state taxes and alternative performance measures do not address the gse and relate to the company on a consolidated basis 
as of december   percent of the company s consolidated on balance sheet assets were held by the gse  and percent of the company s interest income was derived from assets held by and financed by the gse 
in addition  percent of our private credit student loans were held by non gse affiliates 
for the year ended december   percent of our fee income was generated by non gse fee based businesses 
the gse has no employees  so the management of its operations is provided by a non gse subsidiary of the company under a management services agreement 
during the year  the gse transferred billion in private credit student loans in a series of transactions to a non gse subsidiary of the company and recognized gains of million 
all intercompany transactions between the gse and the company and its non gse subsidiaries have been eliminated in the company s consolidated financial statements 
financial highlights for listed below are some of the additional performance measures that management uses to assess the business 
years ended december  diluted earnings per share student loan spread net interest margin servicing and securitization revenue gains on student loan securitizations derivative market value adjustment fee and other income gains losses on sales of securities operating expenses managed student loan acquisitions    preferred channel originations    loans securitized    ending on balance sheet student loans    ending off balance sheet student loans    managed student loans    managed basis student loan spread the main drivers of our earnings are the growth in the managed portfolio of student loans  the student loan spread including the effect of floor income  the number  size and mix of student loans in securitizations  which influence the level of securitization gains  cost effective financing  servicing and securitization revenue  the derivative market value adjustment  guarantor servicing fees  default management operations and collections services and other fee income  and loan servicing  acquisition  and operating expenses 
for the year ended december   our net income was million diluted earnings per share  versus net income of million diluted earnings per share in the million or percent increase in net income can mainly be attributed to higher average balances in managed student loans  securitization gains  the after tax million reduction in the loss on the derivative market value adjustment  and the million after tax increase in floor income 
the growth in our managed student loans benefits net income through the spread earned by student loans on balance sheet  by gains on securitizing such loans  and by the residual cash flows earned as servicing and securitization revenue from the securitized student loans 
the growth in our managed student loan portfolio is therefore an important driver of future earnings 
for  our managed student loan portfolio grew by billion from billion at december  to billion at december  this growth in the student loan portfolio was fueled by the billion in new managed student loans acquired in  a percent increase over the billion acquired in in  we originated billion of student loans through our preferred channel  an increase of percent over the billion originated in the managed student loan spread which measures the spread earned on our portfolio of managed student loans is an important driver of net income  and for the years ended december  and  the managed student loan spread  exclusive of floor income  was percent and percent  respectively 
the increase in the managed student loan spread is attributable to the increase in the proportion of private credit student loans  partially offset by the increase in lower yielding consolidation loans 
the spread also benefitted from our financing activities 
on a managed basis  in  we earned million of floor income  net of payments under floor income contracts  an increase of million or percent over this increase was largely driven by lower average interest rates during the period 
the million decrease in servicing and securitization revenue for the year ended versus was mainly caused by the increase in the constant prepayment rate cpr assumption from percent to percent that was made in the second quarter of to reflect the impact of increased consolidation loan activity on student loans in the securitization trusts 
loans consolidated from the trusts are considered prepayments from the trust s perspective and shorten the average life of the trust 
the shorter average life resulted in a million other than temporary impairment of the retained interest asset that was recognized as a reduction to securitization revenue in the second quarter of this decrease was partially offset by the increase in revenue from the average balance of securitized loans and floor income earned on the securitized loan portfolio 
under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities see critical accounting policies and estimates derivative accounting  some of our derivatives  primarily floor income contracts and basis swaps  are not considered effective hedges because they do not extend to the full term of the hedged item and are therefore required to be valued at fair value while the hedged item is not 
the losses from the derivative market value adjustment are mainly due to declining interest rates and narrower spreads between libor and treasury bill indices  that caused the market value of the floor income contracts and basis swaps to decrease 
the losses on sales of securities are primarily due to losses from the early termination or expiration of eurodollar futures that did not qualify for hedge treatment under sfas no 
included in the eurodollar futures losses are losses incurred where we  in connection with our interest rate risk management and capital planning activities  terminated several hedges and subsequently replaced them with longer term and more economically advantageous hedges which will benefit earnings spreads in future periods 
we continue to expand our fee based businesses  primarily guarantor servicing  debt management services  and loan servicing 
during the first quarter of  we acquired two debt management companies that added million in fee revenue 
in total  the debt management businesses generated gross revenue of million in  an increase of percent from guarantor servicing fees increased by percent in versus we actively manage our operating expenses  which despite the acquisition of two debt management companies and the continued growth of the business  decreased to million for the year ended december  from million in the reduction in operating expenses that offset the increased costs from the new businesses and internal growth is mainly due to the realization of synergies from the usa group acquisition and increased operating efficiencies 
in  we repurchased million shares in connection with our common stock repurchase program 
this was accomplished mainly through the settling of equity forward contracts 
the share repurchases netted against the million common share issuances related to benefit plans reduced common stock outstanding by million shares 
in recent years  the pace of our share repurchases has decelerated as we build capital in connection with the gse wind down 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under varying assumptions or conditions 
note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  particularly as they relate to accounting policies that management believes are most critical that is  they are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and they require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
these accounting policies include securitization accounting  provision for loan losses  and derivative accounting 
securitization accounting we regularly engage in securitization transactions as part of our financing strategy 
in a securitization  we sell student loans to a trust that issues bonds backed by the student loans as part of the transaction 
when our securitizations meet the sale criteria of sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities a replacement of sfas no 
 we record a gain on the sale of the student loans 
to meet the sale criteria of sfas no 
 we structure our securitizations using two step transactions with a qualifying special purpose entity qspe that legally isolates the transferred assets from the company  even in the event of bankruptcy 
also  each transaction is structured to ensure that the holders of the beneficial interests issued by the qspe are not constrained from pledging or exchanging their interests  and that the company does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets 
all of our securitization structures through have been accomplished by issuing the loans in qspes  however  in january of  we structured a securitization of consolidation loans such that the requirements of being a qspe were not met  and the securitization vehicle was considered a variable interest entity and was accounted for on balance sheet 
we calculate gains on our securitizations by taking the difference between the fair value of the assets sold and their carrying value 
when determining the carrying value of the student loan portfolio being securitized  we must estimate the student loan premiums  loan loss reserves and borrower benefits that are applicable to the portfolio of student loans being securitized 
the retained interests in each of our securitizations are treated as available for sale securities in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and therefore must be marked to market and unrealized gains and losses must be recognized  net of tax  in other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
since there are no quoted market prices for our retained interests  we must estimate their fair value both initially and each subsequent quarter using the key assumptions listed below that are considered when estimating the securitization gain on the sale of student loans the projected net interest yield from the underlying securitized loans  the calculation of the embedded floor income associated with the securitized loan portfolio see below  the compound rate of student loan prepayment referred to as the constant prepayment rate or cpr  the discount rate used to calculate the residual interest commensurate with the risks involved  the projected average life or remaining term of the securitized loan portfolio  and the expected credit losses from the underlying securitized loan portfolio 
the fair value of the fixed rate embedded floor income earned on securitized loans is estimated for the life of the loan and included in the fair value of the residual interest at the time of the sale and each subsequent quarter 
this estimate is based on a discounted cash flow calculation that considers the current borrower rate  sap spreads and the term for which the loan is eligible to earn floor income as well as time value  yield curve and volatility factors 
the variable rate embedded floor income  which is earned until the july reset date of the loans  is estimated and included in the quarterly mark to market valuations of the residual interest 
the estimate of the cpr affects the estimate of the average life of the securitized trusts and therefore affects the valuation estimate of the residual interest 
prepayments shorten the average life of the trust  and if all other factors remain equal  will reduce the value of the retained interest asset and the securitization gain on sale 
student loan prepayments come from three principal sources actual borrower prepayments  reimbursements of student loan defaults from the guarantor and consolidation of loans from the trust 
we use historical statistics on prepayments  borrower defaults  and trends in consolidation loans to estimate the amount of prepayments 
when a loan is consolidated from the trust either by us or a third party  the loan is repurchased from the trust and is treated as a prepayment 
in cases where the loan is consolidated by us  it will be recorded as an on balance sheet asset 
due to the historically low interest rate environment  we have experienced an increase in consolidation loan activity for several quarters 
we believe that this trend will continue for the foreseeable future 
as a result  in the second quarter of  we increased the estimated cpr from percent to percent per annum 
the change in the cpr assumption resulted in a million after tax other than temporary impairment of the retained interest asset  of which million million after tax reduced securitization revenue in the second quarter of  and million was an after tax reversal of previously recorded unrealized gains in other comprehensive income as a component of equity 
the change in the cpr assumption also reduced the gains on the loan portfolios securitized during the second  third and fourth quarters of relative to previous transactions 
we record interest income and periodically evaluate our retained interests for other than temporary impairment in accordance with the emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased and retained beneficial interests in securitized financial assets 
under this standard  on a quarterly basis we estimate the cash flows to be received from our retained interests 
in cases where our estimate of future cash flows is below our initial estimate when the asset is acquired  the retained interest is written down to fair value through earnings as an other than temporary impairment 
interest income is recorded using the effective interest method using the most current cash flows 
we also receive income for servicing the loans in our securitization trusts 
we assess the amounts received as compensation for these activities at inception and on an ongoing basis to determine if the amounts received are adequate compensation as defined in sfas no 
to the extent such compensation is determined to be only adequate compensation  no servicing asset or obligation is recorded 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses represents the periodic expense of maintaining an allowance sufficient to absorb losses  net of recoveries  inherent in the portfolio of student loans 
we evaluate the adequacy of the provision for losses on our federally insured portfolio of student loans separately from our non federally insured portfolio of private credit student loans 
a large percentage of our private credit student loans have not matured to a point at which predictable loan loss patterns have developed  so to calculate the private credit student loan loss reserve  we must rely on a combination of our own historic data  such as recent trends in delinquencies  the credit profile of the borrower and or co signer  loan volume by program  and charge offs and recoveries 
we use this data in internally developed statistical models to estimate the amount of losses  net of subsequent collections  that are projected to be incurred on the portfolio of private credit student loans 
when calculating the private credit student loan loss reserve  we subdivide the portfolio into various categories such as loans with co borrowers  months into repayment  and type of program 
we then estimate defaults by cohort loans grouped by the year in which they entered into repayment status based on the borrower s credit profile  net of an estimate of collections by cohort for both new and previously defaulted loans 
private credit student loans are charged off against the allowance when they are days delinquent depending on the type of loan and historic patterns of losses 
this policy is periodically reconsidered by management as trends develop 
private credit student loans continue to accrue interest until they are charged off and removed from the active portfolio 
recoveries on loans charged off are recorded directly to the reserve 
the loan loss reserve attributable to federally insured loans consists of two components the risk sharing reserve and a reserve for rejected guarantor claims losses  caused mainly by servicing defects 
the risk sharing reserve is an estimate based on the amount of loans subject to risk sharing and on the historical experience of losses 
the rejected claims loss reserve is based on the historical trend of ultimate losses on loans initially rejected for reimbursement by the guarantor 
since ffelp loans are guaranteed as to both principal and interest  they continue to accrue interest until such time that they are paid by the guarantor 
once a student loan is rejected for claim payment  our policy is to continue to pursue the recovery of principal and interest  whether by curing the reject or collecting from the borrower 
we attempt to cure the reject by engaging in extensive collection efforts including repeated and methodical mail and phone contact with borrowers and co borrowers 
we have a history of successfully curing rejected claims within two years and  as a result  our policy is to charge off an unpaid claim once it has aged to two years accordingly  the evaluation of the provision for loan losses is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant changes 
management believes that the provision for loan losses is adequate to cover probable losses in the student loan portfolio 
derivative accounting we use interest rate swaps  interest rate futures contracts  interest rate cap contracts  and floor income contracts as an integral part of our overall risk management strategy to manage interest rate risk arising from our fixed rate and floating rate financial instruments 
we account for these instruments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which requires that every derivative instrument  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  be recorded at fair value on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability 
we determine fair value for our derivative contracts using pricing models that consider current market and contractual prices for the underlying financial instruments  as well as time value and yield curve or volatility factors underlying the positions 
pricing models and their underlying assumptions impact the amount and timing of unrealized gains and losses recognized  the use of different pricing models or assumptions could produce different financial results 
many of our derivatives  mainly standard interest rate swaps and certain interest rate futures contracts  qualify as effective hedges under sfas no 
for these derivatives  we document the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged items  as well as the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions at the inception of the hedging relationship 
we link each derivative to either a specific asset or liability on the balance sheet or expected future cash flows  and designate them as either fair value or cash flow hedges 
fair value hedges are designed to hedge our exposure to changes in fair value of a fixed rate asset or liability fair value hedge  while cash flow hedges are desired to hedge our exposure to variability of either a floating rate asset s or liability s cash flows or expected fixed rate debt issuance cash flow hedge 
for effective fair value hedges we mark to market both the hedge and the hedged item with any difference recorded immediately in the income statement 
for effective cash flow hedges  changes in the fair value of the cash flow hedge are deferred in other comprehensive income  net of tax  and recognized in earnings in the same period as the earnings effects of the hedged item 
the assessment of the hedge s effectiveness is performed on an ongoing basis  and is tested on at least a quarterly basis 
when it is determined that a derivative is not currently an effective hedge or it will not be one in the future  we discontinue the hedge accounting prospectively and cease recording changes in the fair value of the hedged item to market 
we also have a number of derivatives  primarily floor income contracts  certain eurodollar futures contracts  interest rate caps and basis swaps  that we believe are effective economic hedges  but are not considered effective hedges under sfas no 
they are considered ineffective under sfas no 
because they are hedging only a portion of the term of the underlying risk or hedging an off balance sheet financial instrument for which the hedged risk is retained in our residual interest 
these derivatives are classified as trading for gaap purposes and as a result they are marked to market through gaap earnings with no consideration for the price fluctuation of the hedged item

information regarding the provision for losses is contained in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
taxable equivalent net interest income for the year ended december  versus the year ended december  increased by million while the net interest margin increased by basis points 
the increase in taxable equivalent net interest income for the year ended december  was primarily due to the lower interest rate environment in  which led to an increase of million in floor income see student loan spread analysis  and the billion increase in the average balance of student loans 
the increase in the net interest margin reflects the higher average balance of student loans as a percentage of average total earning assets  the increased proportion of higher yielding private credit student loans and the increase in floor income 
this increase was partially offset by the increase of lower yielding consolidation loans

 accounting for nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans and initial direct costs of leases 
the unamortized portion of the premiums and discounts are included in the carrying value of the student loan on the consolidated balance sheet 
we recognize income on our student loan portfolio based on the expected yield of the student loan after giving effect to the amortization of purchase premiums and the accretion of student loan discounts including borrower incentive programs 
when student loans are sold in a securitization  the unamortized premium or discount relating to such loans is allocated between the assets sold and the retained interest with the portion allocated to the assets sold included in the gain calculation see securitization program 
origination fees charged on private credit student loans are deferred and in effect become a student loan discount  which is amortized to income over the lives of the student loans 
in the table below  this amortization is netted with the amortization of the premiums 
student loan spread analysis the following table analyzes the spread on student loans both on balance sheet and those off balance sheet in securitization trusts 
for student loans on balance sheet  the amortization of premiums or discounts  the consolidation loan rebate and offset fees  and yield adjustments from borrower benefit programs are netted against student loan interest income on the consolidated statements of income 
for student loans off balance sheet  we earn interest on our retained interests in the trusts  floor income from securitized loans not recognized in the gain on sale calculation and servicing and administration fees for servicing the securitized student loan portfolios

servicing and securitization revenue average balances in millions of dollars on balance sheet student loans    securitized student loans    managed student loans    the student loan spread has increased in each of the last three years from percent in to percent in exclusive of the effects of floor income  the student loan spread increased by basis points in versus this increase was due to several factors 
first  we have lowered our funding costs for on balance sheet loans through lower funding spreads and through the refinancing of some higher rate debt 
losses on such refinancings are included in losses on sales of securities in other income 
second  the percentage of private credit student loans in the on balance sheet student loan portfolio increased to percent in  from percent in these loans are subject to credit risk and therefore earn higher spreads which average percent for the private credit student loan portfolio versus a spread of percent for guaranteed student loans  before floor income 
these positive effects are offset by the continued growth in our consolidation loans  which are lower yielding due mainly to consolidation loan rebate fees 
the basis point increase in the student loan spread from to is primarily due to higher floor income 
floor income for on balance sheet student loans  floor income is included in student loan income 
for off balance student loans  fixed rate embedded floor income is estimated using a discounted cash flow of floor income and included in the residual interest 
variable rate embedded floor income  which by definition is earned in less than one year  is recognized as earned in servicing and securitization revenue

the company periodically re evaluates the requirements for its provision for loan losses 
for the year ended december   private credit student loan charge offs increased by million over the year ago period  which is due primarily to the growth and aging of the private credit student loan portfolio and to a million charge off for fully reserved loans that related to prior periods 
the decrease in the federally insured provision for student loans is mainly due to better than expected loss experience 
the million increase in the provision for loan losses from to was primarily due to the percent increase in volume of private credit student loans year over year 
in  private credit loan charge offs increased by million over which was primarily attributable to the increased volume and aging of this portfolio 
we charge the borrower fees on private credit student loans  both at origination and when the loan enters repayment 
such fees are deferred and recognized into income as a component of interest over the average life of the related pool of loans 
these fees are charged to compensate for anticipated loan losses and prior to  we reflected the unamortized balance of these fees as a component of the allowance for loan losses

we recognize a retained interest asset on balance sheet  which is the present value of these excess cash flows plus any reserve or cash accounts and a gain or loss on the securitization 
the gain or loss is calculated as the difference between the fair value of the assets securitized and an allocation of their carrying value between the cash flows sold and those retained at the time of sale 
the retained interests in each of our securitizations are accounted for as available for sale securities under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and must therefore be recorded at fair value and unrealized gains and losses must be recognized net of tax in other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
since there are no quoted market prices for our retained interests  we must estimate their fair value both initially and each subsequent quarter using several key assumptions  as described in critical accounting policies and estimates  that primarily relate to the valuation of the residual interest 
the balance of the retained interest was billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
the average balance of the retained interest for the years ended december   and was billion  billion and million  respectively 
in  we sold billion of student loans in nine securitization transactions and recorded pre tax securitization gains of million or percent of the portfolios securitized 
in  we sold billion of student loans in four securitization transactions and recorded pre tax securitization gains of million or percent of the portfolios securitized 
the increase in the gains as a percentage of loans securitized is mainly due to the securitization of consolidation loans which have higher fixed rate embedded floor income value and securitization of private credit student loans which have higher relative student loan spreads compared to ffelp loans previously securitized 
in  we sold billion of student loans in four securitization transactions and acquired the securitization revenue streams of billion of student loans previously securitized by usa group 
we recorded pre tax securitization gains of million or percent of the portfolios securitized 
at december  and  securitized student loans outstanding totaled billion and billion  respectively 
at december  and  we held in our investment portfolio billion and billion  respectively  of asset backed securities issued by our securitization trusts 
we purchased these securities in the secondary market 
embedded floor income included in the gain on student loan securitizations is an estimate of the fixed rate embedded floor income from the loans securitized 
depending on interest rate levels  the ongoing estimate of fixed rate embedded floor income can cause volatility in the fair value of the retained interest asset 
the fair value of the fixed rate embedded floor income included in the retained interest asset as of december  and was million and million  respectively 
the fair value of the variable rate embedded floor income included in the retained interest asset as of december  and was million and million  respectively 
servicing and securitization revenue servicing and securitization revenue is the ongoing revenue from securitized loan pools  and includes both the revenue the company receives for servicing loans in the securitization trusts and the income earned on the residual interest 
the following table summarizes the components of servicing and securitization revenue years ended december  servicing revenue securitization revenue  before floor income embedded floor income total servicing and securitization revenue for the years ended december   and  servicing and securitization revenue was percent  percent and percent  respectively  of average securitized loans 
in response to higher consolidation loan activity  we increased the estimated cpr used to calculate the value of the residual interest and the gain or loss on sale of student loans from percent to percent per annum in the second quarter of the change in the cpr assumption resulted in a million after tax other than temporary impairment of the retained interest asset  of which million million after tax reduced securitization revenue in the second quarter of  and million was an after tax reversal of previously recorded unrealized gains in other comprehensive income as a component of equity 
the change in the cpr assumption also reduced the gains on the loan portfolios securitized during the second  third and fourth quarters of relative to previous transactions 
the million increase in servicing and securitization revenue from to was mainly due to lower average interest rates in which increased the amount of embedded floor income by million and to the increased volume of securitized loans 
the increase in embedded floor income earned in is primarily due to the increase in off balance sheet student loans and to lower average interest rates in versus for most of  interest rates rose and  as a result  securitized student loans did not earn at the fixed borrower rate over the period  resulting in only a minimal amount of embedded floor income 
gains losses on sales of securities  net for the years ended december  and  we recognized losses on sales of securities of million and million  respectively 
in connection with our interest rate risk management activities  we terminated or did not renew expired eurodollar future contracts and recognized losses of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these contracts were economically hedging floor income  but were not considered effective hedges under sfas no 
consequently  the losses were recognized 
unrealized gains and losses on these contracts that were previously recorded through the derivative market value adjustment were reversed 
also in and  we refinanced certain debt obligations with longer term debt obligations that had lower interest rates 
in connection with these refinancings  we closed out certain derivatives that were matched with the refinanced debt or extinguished certain debt instruments prior to their maturity and recognized losses on sales of securities of million and million  respectively 
for the year ended december   we had a net gain on the sales of securities of million which was primarily due to gains on the sale of investments of million offsetting derivative losses of million 
guarantor servicing fees  debt management fees and other income the following table summarizes the components of other income for the years ended december   and years ended december  guarantor servicing and debt management fees guarantor servicing fees debt management fees total guarantor servicing and debt management fees other income late fees third party servicing fees other total other income the million increase in guarantor servicing and debt management fees from to is due to the million increase in debt management fees  that is mainly the result of the acquisitions of grc and pcr in january of the million increase in guarantor servicing and debt management fees from to is mainly attributable to these services being acquired from the usa group in july of other income in includes an million loss on the impairment of assets resulting from the sale of our sallie mae solutions product line to systems computer technology corporation that was completed in january the sale included our exeter student suite and perkins campus loan manager product lines and related operations based in cambridge  ma 
the sales agreement also included the sale of sallie mae solutions india operations  which was completed on september  the total sale price was million plus an earnout 
the loss included a million goodwill impairment 
the net loss assumed no purchase price adjustment for potential earnouts 
effects of sfas no 
derivative accounting sfas no 
requires that changes in the fair value of derivative instruments be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria as specified by sfas no 
are met 
we believe that our derivatives are effective economic hedges and they are a critical element of our interest rate risk management strategy 
however  under sfas no 
 some of our derivatives  primarily basis swaps  eurodollar futures contracts and floor income contracts  are considered ineffective hedges because they hedge only a portion of the term of the underlying risk or are hedging an off balance sheet financial instrument 
in these instances the derivatives are classified as trading securities and their stand alone fair value is recorded through the derivative market value adjustment 
no consideration is made in the consolidated statements of income for the price fluctuation of the student loans or the retained interest that these derivatives are hedging 
floor income contracts are not considered effective hedges because the terms of the floor income contracts are shorter than the average life of the student loans and or the floor income contracts are hedging off balance sheet securitized student loans 
we believe that the floor income contracts effectively fix the amount of floor income the company will earn over the contract period  thus eliminating the timing and uncertainty associated with floor income for that period 
basis swaps are used to convert the floating rate debt from one interest rate index to another to match the interest rate characteristics of the assets 
we primarily use basis swaps to change the index of our libor based debt  to better match the cash flows of our student loan assets 
sfas no 
requires that the change in the cash flows of the hedge effectively offset both the change in the cash flows of the asset and the change in the cash flows of the liability 
because student loans can earn at either a variable or a fixed interest rate depending on market interest rates or if the basis swap is economically hedging off balance sheet instruments  the sfas no 
effectiveness test cannot be met 
as a result  these swaps are recorded at fair value with subsequent changes in value reflected in the income statement 
the table below quantifies the impact of sfas no 
derivative accounting on our net income for the years ended december  and when compared with the accounting principles employed in all years prior to the sfas no 
implementation 
gains and losses on certain closed derivative positions that previously qualified as hedges were capitalized and amortized over the term of the hedged item 
under sfas no 
 these amounts are recorded immediately 
similarly  we previously accounted for floor income contracts as hedges and amortized the upfront cash compensation ratably over the lives of the contracts 
under sfas no 
 the upfront payment is deemed a liability and changes in fair value are recorded through income throughout the life of the contract 
years ended december  net impact of derivative accounting derivative market value adjustment in other income amortization of derivative items included in other comprehensive income at transition amortization of premiums on floor income contracts and cap hedges in net interest income amortization of floor income contracts de designated as effective hedges on december  in net interest income impact of eurodollar futures contracts in net interest income impact of eurodollar futures contracts in loss on sales of securities total net negative impact of derivative accounting the derivative market value adjustment is caused by interest rate volatility and changing credit spreads during the period and the volume and term of derivatives not receiving hedge accounting treatment 
the decline in the value of floor income contracts is caused by declining interest rates that cause the underlying student loans to earn additional floor income which is transferred to the counterparties 
the decline in the market value of the floor income contracts is economically offset by the increase in value of the student loan portfolio earning floor income  but that offsetting increase in value is not recognized under sfas no 
operating expenses the following table summarizes the components of operating expenses years ended december  servicing and acquisition expenses general and administrative expenses goodwill and intangible amortization integration charge total operating expenses no amortization of goodwill in operating expenses include costs incurred to service our managed student loan portfolio  to acquire student loans  to perform guarantor servicing and debt management operations  and general and administrative expenses 
the increase in servicing and acquisition expenses for versus was due to operating expenses associated with the acquisitions of pcr and grc in the first quarter of this increase was partially offset by operating expense synergies from acquisitions in prior years and productivity improvements 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  versus was principally due to productivity improvements in our operations and the sale of the student information software business 
the million integration charge that we recorded in related primarily to the acquisition of usa group and covered severance costs  costs to close facilities and move functional responsibilities as well as costs to align system capabilities and consolidate our data center 
costs in were lower than the subsequent years which included the additional operating expenses from several acquisitions  most notably the acquisition of usa group 
federal and state taxes the company is subject to federal and state taxes  while the gse is exempt from all state  local and district of columbia income  franchise  sales and use  personal property and other taxes  except for real property taxes

alternative performance measures in addition to evaluating our gaap based data  management  credit rating agencies  lenders and analysts also evaluate us on certain non gaap based performance measures  which we refer to as core cash measures 
under these non gaap based performance measures  management analyzes the student loan portfolio on a managed basis and treats securitization transactions as financings versus sales 
as such  the securitization gain on sale and subsequent servicing and securitization revenue is eliminated from income  and net interest income from securitized loans is recognized 
these non gaap based performance measures also eliminate the benefit of floor income and use pre sfas no 
accounting for our derivative transactions  treating all of them as effective hedges 
we also exclude certain transactions that management does not consider part of our core business  such as gains or losses on certain sales of securities and derivative contracts  changes in the market value and the amortization of goodwill and acquired intangible assets  and merger integration charges 
for the years ended december   and  the effect of these non gaap performance measures on pre tax gaap earnings are as follows years ended december  non gaap performance measures treatment of securitizations as financings versus sales floor income on managed loans net impact of derivative accounting losses gains on sales of securities goodwill change in market value goodwill and intangible amortization merger integration charge total non gaap performance measures management believes this information provides additional insight into the financial performance of the company s core business activities 
student loan spread analysis managed basis the following table analyzes the student loan spread  exclusive of floor income  from our portfolio of managed student loans for the years ended december   and years ended december  managed basis student loan yields consolidation loan rebate fees 


offset fees 


borrower benefits 


premium and origination fee amortization 


managed basis student loan net yield managed basis student loan cost of funds managed basis student loan spread average balances in millions of dollars managed student loans    the managed basis student loan spread combines both our on balance sheet and off balance sheet student loans 
for  the managed basis student loan spread increased by basis points from percent in to percent in this was mainly due to the percentage of private credit student loans in the managed student loan portfolio increasing to percent in  from percent in these loans are subject to much higher credit risk than federally guaranteed student loans and therefore earn higher spreads  which for  was percent versus percent for guaranteed student loans  before floor income 
these positive effects are offset by the continued growth in our consolidation loans  which are lower yielding due mainly to consolidation loan rebate fees 
the managed student loan spread also benefited from lower funding costs for on balance sheet loans achieved through the refinancing of some higher rate debt that was funding student loans 
losses on such refinancings are included in losses on sales of securities in other income 
delinquencies managed basis the table below shows our private credit student loan delinquency trends for the last three years on a managed basis 
delinquencies have the potential to adversely impact earnings if the account charges off and results in increased servicing and collection costs

in july  the company completed the acquisition of student loan funding resources  inc slfr 
consists primarily of off balance sheet loans acquired from usa group and slfr 
preferred channel originations a leading indicator of the success of our marketing strategy is the growth in our preferred channel originations 
these loans are either originated by us under our own brand name or they are originated on behalf of other lenders  and are acquired by us shortly after origination 
student loans originated through our preferred channel are acquired by us earlier in the life cycle and have lower purchase premiums versus loans acquired through our commitment clients and the spot market 
as a result preferred channel student loans are higher earning assets 
in  we originated billion in student loan volume through our preferred channel  an percent increase over the billion originated in approximately percent of our preferred channel originations was through our lender partners and percent were originated through our own brands 
the pipeline of loans that we currently service and are committed to purchase was billion at december  and the following tables further break down our preferred channel originations by type of loan and source

the aircraft financing business continues to be adversely affected by the slowdown in the commercial aircraft industry that began in early and was exacerbated by the terrorist attacks of september  in addition  the continuing reduction in aircraft passenger volume has resulted in the grounding of a significant number of aircraft 
based on an analysis of the expected losses on certain leveraged leases plus the increase in incremental tax obligations related to forgiveness of debt obligations and or the taxable gain on the sale of the aircraft  we recognized after tax impairment charges of million  or 
per share  for the year ended december  to reflect the impairment of certain aircraft leased to united airlines  who declared bankruptcy in december should the reduction in aircraft passenger volume persist  the company has exposure to the airline industry of million 
additional information regarding our investments in leveraged leases is contained in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources a primary funding objective is to maintain our student loan spread by continuing to match the interest rate characteristics of our assets and liabilities 
to accomplish this we must broaden our already diverse funding sources to ensure that we have sufficient liquidity to refinance the gse debt to meet our september target date for the gse wind down 
currently our primary sources of liquidity are through debt issuances by the gse  off balance sheet financings through securitizations  borrowings under our commercial paper and medium term note programs  other senior note issuances  and cash generated by our subsidiaries and distributed through dividends to the company 
our managed borrowings are broken down as follows years ended december  average balance average rate average balance average rate average balance average rate gse    non gse   securitizations off balance sheet   total managed borrowings    gse financing activities the gse secures financing to fund its on balance sheet portfolio of student loans  along with its other operations  by issuing debt securities in the domestic and overseas capital markets  through public offerings and private placements of us dollar denominated and foreign currency denominated debt of varying maturities and interest rate characteristics 
the gse s debt securities are currently rated at the highest credit rating level by both moody s and s p 
historically  the agencies ratings of the gse have been largely a factor of its status as a government sponsored enterprise 
since the privatization act did not modify the attributes of debt issued by the gse  management anticipates that the gse will retain its current credit ratings 
the gse s unsecured financing requirements are driven by the following factors refinancing of existing liabilities as they mature  financing of the net growth in the student loan portfolio  the level of securitization activity  and the transfer and refinancing of gse assets by non gse entities of the company 
securitization activities since the establishment of our program in  securitization of student loans has been the principal source of non gse long term funding for our managed portfolio of student loans 
during  the company completed nine securitization transactions totaling billion versus four transactions totaling billion in student loans in at december   billion or percent of our managed student loans outstanding were in off balance sheet securitized trusts 
in  our securitization activity not only accelerated in volume  but also diversified our securitization program 
in the fourth quarter of  we completed our first securitization of private credit student loans  and we also completed our first securitization consisting exclusively of consolidation loans 
we expect to accelerate and diversify our securitization activity as we refinance long term gse debt in anticipation of the gse wind down 
our asset backed securities generally have a higher net cost to fund our student loans than our gse on balance sheet financing because the asset backed securities are term match funded to the assets securitized and do not benefit from the federal government s implicit guarantee of gse debt 
the gse s funding advantage over our securitizations is somewhat mitigated by the absence of offset fees on securitized loans 
our securitizations to date have been structured to achieve a triple a credit rating on over percent of the asset backed securities sold 
securities issued in our typical ffelp student loan securitizations are indexed to libor while the index on our securitized loans are either indexed to the day or week treasury bill or commercial paper 
we manage this off balance sheet basis risk through on balance sheet financing activities  principally through basis swaps 
non gse unsecured on balance sheet financing activities while the securitization market is the core of our long term financing strategy  it is supplemented by commercial paper  bank lines of credit  underwritten long term debt  and global and medium term note programs 
the following table shows the senior unsecured credit ratings on our non gse debt from the major rating agencies

interest on these facilities is based on libor plus a spread that is determined by the amount of the facility utilized and the company s credit rating 
cash flows during  the company used the proceeds from student loan securitizations of billion  repayments and claim payments on student loans of billion  and the net proceeds from sales of student loans to acquire student loans either through purchase or origination billion or through consolidating loans billion from our securitized trusts and to repurchase million of the company s common stock 
operating activities provided net cash inflows of million in  a decrease of million from the net cash inflows of million in operating cash flows is driven by net income adjusted for various non cash items such as gains and losses on sales of student loans and securities  the derivative market value adjustment and the provision for loan losses 
operating cash flows are also affected by the timing of the receipt or payment of cash for other assets and liabilities 
during  the company issued billion of long term notes  of which billion was issued by the gse and billion was issued by slm corporation  to refund maturing debt obligations and finance the acquisition of student loans 
at december   the company had billion of long term debt  of which billion is an obligation of the gse and billion is an obligation of slm corporation 
billion of the gse s long term debt had stated maturities that could be accelerated through call provisions 
risks overview managing risks is an essential part of successfully operating a financial services company 
our most prominent risk exposures are operational  market  political and regulatory  liquidity  credit  and consolidation loan refinancing risk 
operational risk operational risk can result from regulatory compliance errors  other servicing errors see further discussion below  technology  breaches of the internal control system  and the risk of fraud or unauthorized transactions by employees or persons outside the company 
this risk of loss also includes the potential legal actions that could arise as a result of an operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards and contractual commitments  adverse business decisions or their implementation  and customer attrition due to potential negative publicity 
the federal guarantee on our student loans is conditioned on compliance with origination and servicing standards set by the doe and guarantor agencies 
a mitigating factor is our ability to cure servicing deficiencies and historically our losses have been small 
should we experience a high rate of servicing deficiencies  the cost of remedial servicing or the eventual losses on the student loans that are not cured could be material 
our servicing and operating processes are highly dependent on our information system infrastructure  and we face the risk of business disruption should there be extended failures of our information systems  any number of which could have a material impact on our business 
we have a number of back up and recovery plans in the event of systems failures 
these plans are tested regularly and monitored constantly 
we manage operational risk through our risk management and internal control processes which involve each business line as well as executive management 
the business lines have direct and primary responsibility and accountability for identifying  controlling  and monitoring operational risk  and each business line manager maintains a system of controls with the objective of providing proper transaction authorization and execution  proper system operations  safeguarding of assets from misuse or theft  and ensuring the reliability of financial and other data 
while we believe that we have designed effective methods to minimize operational risks  our operations remain vulnerable to natural disasters  human error  technology and communication system breakdowns and fraud 
market and interest rate risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and or interest rates of our financial instruments 
our primary market risk is from changes in interest rates and interest spreads 
we have an active interest rate risk management program that is designed to reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates and maintain consistent earning spreads in all interest rate environments 
we use derivative instruments extensively to hedge our interest rate exposure  but in our hedging activities is a risk that we are not hedging all potential interest rate exposures or that the hedges do not perform as designed 
we measure interest rate risk by calculating the variability of net interest income in future periods under various interest rate scenarios using projected balances for interest earning assets  interest bearing liabilities and derivatives used to hedge interest rate risk 
many assumptions are utilized by management to calculate the impact that changes in interest rates may have on net interest income  the more significant of which are related to student loan volumes and pricing  the timing of cash flows from our student loan portfolio  particularly the impact of floor income and the rate of student loan consolidations  interest spreads and the maturity of our debt and derivatives 
see also interest rate risk management 
political regulatory risk because we operate in a federally sponsored loan program  we are subject to political and regulatory risk 
as part of the higher education act  the student loan program is periodically amended and must be reauthorized every six years 
past changes included reduced loan yields paid to the lenders in and  increased fees paid by lenders in  decreased level of the government guaranty in and reduced fees to guarantors and collectors  among others 
the program is scheduled to be reauthorized in although management expects reauthorization to be completed in there can be no assurances that the reauthorization will not result in changes that may have an adverse impact to the company 
the secretary of education oversees and implements the higher education act and periodically issues regulations and interpretations that may impact our business 
in addition  the activities and financial condition of the gse are regulated by the us department of the treasury s office of sallie mae oversight osmo 
liquidity risk in connection with the wind down of the gse  we must continue to diversify our funding sources outside of the government agency market 
as such  we have increasing credit spread and liquidity exposure to the capital markets 
a major disruption in the fixed income capital markets that limits our ability to raise funds or significantly increases the cost of those funds would have a material impact on our ability to acquire student loans  our results of operations and the timely and effective completion of the privatization plan 
credit risk we bear full risk of any losses experienced in our private credit student loan portfolio 
these loans are underwritten and priced according to risk  generally determined by a commercially available consumer credit scoring system  fico 
additionally  for borrowers who do not meet our lending requirements  we require credit worthy co borrowers 
we have defined credit policies  and ongoing risk monitoring and review processes for all private credit student loans 
while the portfolio has not matured to a point where predictable loan loss patterns have developed  the performance to date has met our expectations  as net charge offs in were percent of the average managed private credit loan balance 
the performance of the private credit student loan portfolio is affected by the economy and a prolonged economic downturn may have an adverse effect on its credit performance 
management believes that it has provided sufficient allowances to cover the losses that may be experienced in both the federally guaranteed and private credit portfolios 
there is  however  no guarantee that such allowances are sufficient enough to account for actual losses 
see activity in the allowance for student loan losses 
the majority of our portfolio of federally insured student loans is subject to a two percent risk sharing loss in the event of default 
credit losses on this portfolio are minimal 
we have credit risk exposure to the various counterparties with whom we have entered into derivative contracts 
we review the credit standing of these companies 
our credit policies place limits on the amount of exposure we may take with any one party and in many cases  require collateral to secure the position 
the credit risk associated with derivatives is measured based on the replacement cost should the counterparties with contracts in a gain position to the company fail to perform under the terms of the contract 
we also have credit risk with several commercial airlines related to our portfolio of leveraged leases 
see leveraged leases 
consolidation loan refinancing risk our portfolio of federal student loans is subject to refinancing through the consolidation loan program 
consolidation loans can have two detrimental effects 
first  if we consolidate our borrowers loans  the new consolidation loans have a lower yield than the ffelp loans they replaced due to the federally mandated consolidation loan rebate fee of percent per annum 
this fee is somewhat mitigated by larger average balances  longer average lives  lower servicing costs  and slightly higher sap margins 
second and more importantly  we may lose student loans in our portfolio that are consolidated with other lenders 
over the past two years the company has experienced a net runoff of student loans from consolidation loan activity as more of our student loans were consolidated with other lenders 
during  we consolidated billion of student loans and due to an increased marketing focus on consolidation loans  the net runoff of student loans was reduced from billion in to million in the success of our consolidation marketing campaign reversed this trend completely in the fourth quarter as the company had a net increase in student loans from consolidations of million 
interest rate risk management interest rate gap analysis we manage our interest rate risk on a managed basis and as a result we use on balance sheet derivatives to hedge the basis risk in our securitization trusts as the trusts typically issue asset backed securities indexed to libor to fund student loans indexed to either the day treasury bill  commercial paper or in the case of private credit loans  the prime rate 
at december   there were approximately billion of asset backed securities issued by our securitization trusts that were indexed to libor  million of securities indexed to commercial paper  million of securities indexed to euribor  and million of auction rate securities 
there were also billion of plus student loans in the trusts that are funded by asset backed securities indexed to libor or the day treasury bill 
we hedge our off balance sheet basis risk through on balance sheet derivatives  the effect of which is included in the gap analysis table below as the impact of securitized student loans 
in the table below the company s variable rate assets and liabilities are categorized by reset date of the underlying index 
fixed rate assets and liabilities are categorized based on their maturity dates 
an interest rate gap is the difference between volumes of assets and volumes of liabilities maturing or repricing during specific future time intervals 
the following gap analysis reflects rate sensitive positions at december  and is not necessarily reflective of positions that existed throughout the period

the following tables summarize the effect on earnings for the years ended december  and and the effect on fair values at december  and  based upon a sensitivity analysis performed by us assuming a hypothetical increase in market interest rates of basis points and basis points while funding spreads remain constant 
we have chosen to show the effects of a hypothetical increase to interest rates  as an increase gives rise to a larger absolute value change to the financial statements 
the effect on earnings was performed on our variable rate assets  liabilities and hedging instruments while the effect on fair values was performed on our fixed rate assets  liabilities and hedging instruments 
year ended december  year ended december  interest rates interest rates change from increase of basis points change from increase of basis points change from increase of basis points change from increase of basis points dollars in millions  except per share amounts effect on earnings increase decrease in pre tax net income before sfas no

however  as discussed under student loans floor income  in the current low interest rate environment  the ffelp student loan portfolio is earning floor income from the reduction in the variable rate liabilities funding student loans at the fixed borrower rate 
therefore  absent other hedges  in a low interest rate environment the hypothetical rise in interest rates in the above table has a greater adverse effect on earnings and fair values due to the reduction in potential floor income than in higher interest rate environments where the interest rate formula rises above the borrower rate and the student loans become a floating rate asset that is matched with floating rate debt 
during the year ended december   certain ffelp student loans were earning floor income and we locked in a portion of that floor income through the use of futures and swap contracts 
the result of these hedging transactions was to convert a portion of floating rate debt into fixed rate debt  matching the fixed rate nature of the student loans and fixing the relative spread between the student loan asset rate and the converted fixed rate liability 
in low interest rate environments when certain student loans are earning floor income  under the scenario where interest rates increase basis points  the decrease in pre tax net income before sfas no 
reflects lower floor income on the unhedged portion of our student loan portfolio 
under the scenario where interest rates increase basis points  the change in pre tax net income before sfas no 
is not proportional to the change under the scenario where interest rates increase basis points because of the additional spread earned on loans hedged with futures and swaps mentioned above and the greater proportion of loans earning at a floating rate under a basis point increase in rates 
average terms to maturity the following table reflects the average terms to maturity for our managed earning assets and liabilities at december  in years on balance sheet off balance sheet managed earning assets student loans academic facilities financings and other loans cash and investments total earning assets borrowings short term borrowings 

long term borrowings total borrowings in the above table  treasury receipts and variable rate asset backed securities  although generally liquid in nature  extend the weighted average remaining term to maturity of cash and investments to years 
as student loans are securitized  the need for long term on balance sheet financing will decrease 
long term debt issuances likely to be called have been categorized according to their call dates rather than their maturity dates 
the following schedule summarizes expirations of commitments and long term notes to the earlier of call date or maturity date outstanding at december  december  student loan purchases warehousing advances letters of credit long term notes total     common stock earnings not invested in our business operations are used to pay dividends on our common stock and to repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock 
the purpose of our common stock repurchase activity is to enhance share value more tax effectively than through dividends and to enable the remaining shareholders to own a greater percentage of outstanding shares 
for the years ended december  and  we issued a net million shares of common stock and treasury stock totaling million and million shares totaling million  respectively  in connection with our benefit plans and acquisitions 
for the years ended december  and  we repurchased million shares totaling million and million shares totaling million  respectively  through our open market purchases and through the settlement of equity forward contracts 
the net result was to decrease outstanding shares to million at december  from million shares at december  due to the highly predictable nature of our cash flow  we utilize equity forward contracts to better manage the cost associated with our share repurchases 
in the equity forward agreements we contract to purchase shares from a third party at a future date 
at or prior to the maturity date of the agreement  we  at our sole option  can purchase the shares from the third party at the contracted amount or we can net cash or net share settle the contract 
at december   the total common shares that could potentially be acquired over the next four years under outstanding equity forward contracts was million shares at an average price of per share  and we have remaining authority to enter into additional share repurchases and equity forward contracts for million shares 
years ended december  shares in millions common shares repurchased open market 
equity forwards total shares repurchased average purchase price per share equity forward contracts outstanding at beginning of year new contracts exercises outstanding at end of year board of director authority remaining at end of year as of december   the expiration dates and range of purchase prices for outstanding equity forward contracts are as follows contracts in millions year of maturity outstanding contracts range of market prices the fasb has tentatively reached a conclusion on new rules governing the accounting for equity forward contracts 
under the proposed rules  for those contracts that allow a net settlement option either in cash or the company s stock  we would account for the equity forward contract under sfas no 
and periodically mark the contract to market through income 
for those contracts that require physical settlement only  we would recognize a liability and contra equity 
our contracts typically allow net settlement  so if the rule were effective  based on a closing share price at december   we would have recognized an asset of million from marking the equity forward contracts to market 
student loan marketing association privatization act gse wind down under the privatization act  the gse must wind down its operations and dissolve on or before september   and until the gse is dissolved  the privatization act places a number of limitations on the gse 
management  however  plans to accelerate the wind down of the gse to no later than september this plan was approved by the gse s board of directors in january any gse debt obligations outstanding at the date of such dissolution are required to be defeased through creation of a fully collateralized trust  consisting of cash or financial instrument backed by the full faith and credit of the us government with cash flows that match the interest and principal obligations of the defeased debt 
the privatization act requires that on the dissolution date  the gse shall repurchase or redeem  or make proper provisions for repurchase or redemption of any outstanding preferred stock 
the gse redeemed its series a  adjustable rate cumulative preferred stock  its only outstanding preferred stock  in the fourth quarter of also upon the gse s dissolution  all of its remaining assets will transfer to the company 
the privatization act effectively requires that the gse maintain a minimum statutory capital adequacy ratio the ratio of the gse s stockholders equity to total assets plus percent of the credit equivalent amount of certain off balance sheet items of at least percent or be subject to certain safety and soundness requirements designed to restore such statutory ratio 
while the gse may not finance or guarantee the activities of its non gse affiliates  it may  subject to its minimum capital requirements  dividend retained earnings and surplus capital to slm corporation  which in turn may contribute such amounts to its non gse subsidiaries 
at december   the gse s statutory capital adequacy ratio was percent 
the gse has also received guidance from the us department of the treasury s office of sallie mae oversight regarding safety and soundness considerations affecting its wind down 
as a result  in connection with any dividend declarations  the gse will supplement the statutory minimum capital ratio requirement with a risk based capital measurement formula 
management does not expect the capital levels of our consolidated balance sheet to change as a result of this supplemental formula 
the privatization act imposes certain restrictions on intercompany relations between the gse and its affiliates during the wind down period 
the gse may  however  continue to issue new debt obligations maturing on or before september  although  because of the accelerated wind down described above  the company does not intend to issue any new gse debt with maturities beyond september  the legislation further provides that the legal status and attributes of the gse s debt obligations  including the exemptions from sec registration and state taxes  will be fully preserved until their respective maturities 
such debt obligations will remain gse debt obligations  whether such obligations were outstanding at the time of  or issued subsequent to  the reorganization of the gse into the current holding company structure 
in connection with the wind down of the gse  we must either securitize  sell or defease the gse s assets by the wind down date and retire or defease the gse s debt obligations 
the following table summarizes the gse s asset sales and transfers for the years ended december  and years ended december  dollars in millions ffelp student loan securitizations   private credit student loan sales  transfer of leveraged leases  net includes accrued interest receivable
