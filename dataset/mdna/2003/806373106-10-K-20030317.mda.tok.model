new goodwill accounting rules 
on january   the company adopted sfas  the new accounting pronouncement on goodwill accounting 
previously  the company recorded monthly amortization of goodwill  generally over a year period 
the new rules that became effective january  prohibit the amortization of goodwill 
rather  goodwill is to be reviewed on a periodic basis  and if a write down is required  the write down must be taken at that time  similar to an impairment charge on other long lived assets 
the goodwill amortization was and  for the quarter and year ended december   respectively 
the company s results with the pro forma effect of the new accounting rules on the quarter and year ended december  are as follows proforma results excluding goodwill amortization quarter and year ended december  in thousands  except per share amounts period ended december  quarter year unaudited reported net income   add back goodwill amortization  subtract tax effect of goodwill amortization adjusted net income   basic earnings per share reported net income add back goodwill amortization subtract tax effect of goodwill amortization adjusted basic earnings per share diluted earnings per share reported net income add back goodwill amortization subtract tax effect of goodwill amortization adjusted diluted earnings per share results of operations years ended december  and schawk  inc comparative consolidated statements of operations years ended december  and in thousands change change net sales    cost of sales    gross profit    gross margin percentage selling  general and administrative expenses    amortization of intangibles   nm restructuring and other charges    nm operating income    operating margin percentage other income expense interest and dividend income nm interest expense    other income expense nm income before income taxes and minority interest    income tax provision   effective income tax rate income before minority interest    minority interest in net loss of subsidiary nm net income    nm percentage not meaningful net sales for decreased versus on the consumer products packaging side of the business  which represents approximately of the company s overall business  revenues with the company s consumer products packaging accounts increased in the current year versus the prior year 
however  lower sales in the graphic for advertising agency business more than offset the gains from the consumer products packaging business 
the lower sales level in the advertising agency business is due to the continuing weakness in the advertising market 
gross margin as a percentage of net sales for increased to from for the prior year 
given the fact that net sales were lower than the prior period  an increase in gross margin as a percentage of sales is a positive result 
the increase in gross margin as a percentage of sales indicates that the cost cutting moves the company initiated through its restructurings is having a positive effect 
operating income in was higher than the previous year despite million of asset impairment and severance charges classified as restructuring and other charges on the consolidated statement of operations as compared to million of restructuring charges in the increase in operating income was attributable to cost reduction efforts and restructuring efforts completed in prior years and the nonamortization of goodwill due to the change in accounting method 
restructuring and other charges of million in resulted from million of charges for asset impairment recorded in accordance with the new accounting standard for asset impairments  statement of financial accounting standard no 
and million from severance costs in the second half of the new accounting standard requires a review of all long lived assets including property  plant and equipment as well as any other long term assets when indicators of impairment exist 
the company performed a review as of june  and determined that million of assets  primarily software and software development assets  had little or no value based on obsolescence or limited use 
the company also recorded asset impairment charges of million in the fourth quarter of in addition  in restructuring charges of million were recorded related to severance costs and the cost to terminate a lease 

the company continues to evaluate its operations for possible changes including consolidation of certain locations and changing the staffing levels of other operations to reflect the volume of business being serviced by such locations 
other income expense net decreased in compared with the lower net expense was primarily as a result of lower interest expense 
the decrease in interest expense was from a combination of lower interest rates and lower borrowing levels in as compared to the prior year 
the lower borrowing levels were due to strong cash flows from operations that were utilized  in part  to pay down debt 
interest expense also benefited from lower rates in versus income tax provision as a percentage of pretax income was lower than the previous year as a result of offsetting the regular tax provision with tax benefits from state tax refunds received in the second quarter of and tax benefits from the reduction in tax liabilities in connection with the settlement of an outstanding liability for lower amount than the amount that had been accrued 
as a result  the effective tax rate for year ended december  was as compared to in the comparable period of the prior year 
net income for the year ended december  increased significantly versus for the reasons previously discussed 
basic and diluted earnings per share were and  respectively  for the year ended december  compared with and for results of operation s years ended december  and schawk  inc comparative consolidated statements of operations years ended december  and in thousands change change net sales    cost of sales    gross profit    gross margin percentage selling  general and administrative expenses   amortization of intangibles   restructuring and other charges    nm operating income    operating margin percentage other income expense interest and dividend income interest expense    other income expense nm income before income taxes and minority interest    income tax provision    effective income tax rate income before minority interest    minority interest in net loss of subsidiary nm net income    compared to net sales 
net sales for decreased from the prior year 
the decrease in revenues was primarily attributable to soft market conditions and mergers among many of the company s largest clients 
soft market conditions that began impacting the company s results in mid continued throughout all of however  prepress for the packaging part of the business started to pick up in the fourth quarter 
conversely  the prepress for advertising and promotion part of the business remained soft throughout the fourth quarter reflecting the lowest level of advertising spending in years 
nine of the company s top accounts were involved in mergers in and with respect to the impact of the mergers of many of our top accounts  branding and marketing decisions were put on hold while corporate branding strategies were being reviewed and changed 
management of the company believes that most of the slowdown in business related to mergers at the company s clients is over 
finally  two percentage points of the drop in sales in was from a strategic withdrawal from printing in connection with consolidation of facilities in the toronto marketplace  which historically were at low margins and not part of the company s plans for the future 
cost of sales 
cost of sales for as a percent of sales was consistent with the prior year despite the decrease in sales previously described 
approximately of the company s costs are labor costs 
the company was able to reduce costs as a result of previous and current year restructuring efforts through attrition and layoffs 
operating income 
operating income in decreased from the prior year 
operating income was negatively impacted by lower gross profit due to lower volumes at most of the company s divisions in selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased as a percentage of sales to in from for as a result of spending on the company s own branding changes  including logo changes  new identities for the operating units using the schawk name to replace the historical names of acquired companies and increased advertising 
other increases in sg a are due to increased depreciation and amortization in sg a related to new computer equipment and software purchased in to upgrade the company s information systems to make them consistent throughout the organization and increased staffing in information systems to carry out the new systems initiatives

total restructuring charges for were million compared to million in the previous year

income before income taxes 
income before income taxes for decreased compared to the prior year 
the reduction in pretax income margin was primarily due to lower sales in as compared to as described previously 
income taxes 
income taxes were at an effective rate of and for and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective rate was primarily due to lower taxes in high tax rate states due to lower profits attributable to those states in as compared to net income

management believes that the level of working capital is adequate for the company s liquidity needs related to normal operations both currently and in the foreseeable future  and that the company has sufficient resources to support its growth  either through currently available cash  through cash generated from future operations or through short term financing 
the company had capital expenditures of million  million  and million in   and respectively

these agreements expire ranging from to critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that effect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our critical accounting policies are limited to those described below 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable 
the company s clients are primarily consumer product manufacturers  converters and advertising agencies  none of which individually represent more than of total revenue 
accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due to us from our normal business activities 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect the expected losses of accounts receivable based on past collection history and specific risks identified in the portfolio 
impairment of long lived assets 
we record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those items 
our cash flow estimates are based on historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions 
the net carrying value of assets not recoverable is reduced to fair value 
our estimates of fair value represent our best estimate based on industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions 
goodwill and other acquired intangible assets 
the company had made acquisitions in the past that included a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets 
under generally accepted accounting principles in effect through december   these assets were amortized over their estimated useful lives  and were tested periodically to determine if they were recoverable from operating earnings on an undiscounted basis over their useful lives 
effective in  goodwill is no longer amortized but is subject to an annual or under certain circumstances more frequent impairment test based on its estimated fair value 
other intangible assets that meet certain criteria continue to be amortized over their useful lives and are also subject to an impairment test based on estimated undiscounted cash flows 
there are many assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of an impairment loss 
another estimate using different  but still reasonable  assumptions could produce a significantly different result 
therefore  impairment losses could be recorded in the future 
the company adopted the new rules on accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets effective january  application of the nonamortization provision resulted in an increase in net income of approximately million per share 
during  the company performed the first required impairment test of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
it was determined appropriate to consider the company to be one reporting unit for purposes of this test and that no impairment charge was required since the fair value of the company exceeds the company s carrying value  including goodwill 
impact of inflation the company believes that over the past three years inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate exposure based on the company s variable rate debt outstanding at december   a change in interest rates would impact interest expense by approximately million 
assuming similar interest rates volatility in the future  a near term months change in interest rates would not materially affect the company s consolidated financial position  results of operation or cash flows 
foreign exchange exposure the company has foreign operations that expose it to translation risk when the local currency financial statements are translated to us dollars 
since changes in translation risk are reported as adjustments to stockholders equity  a change in the foreign exchange rate would not have material effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows
