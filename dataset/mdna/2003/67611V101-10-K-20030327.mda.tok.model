item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our selected consolidated financial and operating data and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are one of the largest providers of hospice care in the united states in terms of both average daily census and number of locations 
we have grown rapidly since we opened our first hospice location in january through the development of new hospice locations and a series of acquisitions  we now have hospice locations to serve patients and their families in states 
our net patient service revenue increased from million in to million in we operate all of our hospice locations through our operating subsidiaries 
our net patient service revenue of million in represents an increase of over net patient service revenue of million in and an increase of over net patient service revenue of million in in  and  we reported net income of million  million and million  respectively 
on january   we announced that our board of directors had authorized a three for two stock split payable in the form of a fifty percent stock dividend that was distributed on february   to stockholders of record at the close of business on february  we had approximately million shares of common stock outstanding at the close of business on february  and issued approximately million shares of common stock to the stockholders of record 
developed hospices we have developed the following hospices since january  during  we began development of two new hospices in el paso  texas  and chicago arlington heights  illinois  which were opened in during  we began development of four new hospices in norfolk  virginia  chicago south  illinois  tulsa  oklahoma and austin  texas 
our norfolk  virginia hospice location opened in during  we continued development of the chicago south  illinois  tulsa  oklahoma and austin  texas hospices and began development of new hospices in montgomery  alabama  st 
louis  missouri  cleveland  ohio and big spring  texas 
our chicago south  illinois  tulsa  oklahoma  austin  texas  montgomery  alabama and st 
louis  missouri hospice locations opened in in  we are continuing development of the cleveland  ohio and big spring  texas hospices and have started development of hospices in philadelphia  pennsylvania  richmond  virginia  cincinnati  ohio  portland  oregon  santa fe  new mexico and toledo  ohio 
acquisitions we have acquired the following hospices since january  during  we acquired one hospice for a purchase price of million 
we financed our acquisition in with million in cash obtained from borrowings under our credit agreement and a promissory note payable to the seller in the principal amount of million 
during  we acquired seven hospices for a combined purchase price of million 
we financed our acquisitions in with million in cash obtained from borrowings under our credit agreement  million in cash from the proceeds of our initial public offering and promissory notes payable to the sellers in the aggregate principal amount of million 
during  we acquired twelve hospices for a combined purchase price of million  and also acquired the remaining interest in hospice of houston  lp for million 
we financed our acquisitions in  including the interest in hospice of houston  with million in cash from the proceeds of our initial public offering 
in february  we acquired one hospice for a purchase price of million 
we financed our acquisition in with million in cash from the proceeds of our initial public offering 
we accounted for these acquisitions as purchases 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
as part of our ongoing acquisition strategy  we are continually evaluating other potential acquisition opportunities 
goodwill from our hospice acquisitions was million as of december  goodwill was of common stockholders equity and of total assets as of december  during fiscal and prior years  we amortized our goodwill over years for acquisitions completed through june  and did not amortize goodwill for acquisitions subsequent to june  under new rules issued by the financial accounting standards board  effective for fiscal  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the new rules 
other intangible assets continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
we are applying the new rules on accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
application of the non amortization provisions of the new rules in would have resulted in a decrease in amortization expense of million  net of tax 
the following table lists our acquisitions since january   and patient census data at acquisition patient census on date of hospice acquisition los angeles culver city  california little rock  arkansas colorado springs  colorado charleston  south carolina beaumont  texas pittsburgh  pennsylvania palm springs  california odessa  texas baton rouge  louisiana new orleans  louisiana shreveport  louisiana columbus  ohio bakersfield  california wichita  kansas gulf coast  mississippi albuquerque  new mexico omaha  nebraska lake charles  louisiana la grange  texas round rock  texas waxahachie  texas operations of our pittsburgh  pennsylvania hospice acquired in were transferred to our pittsburgh  pennsylvania hospice opened in operations of our riverside  california hospice  which we acquired in  were relocated to our san bernardino  california hospice location  which we acquired in in connection with the relocation of our riverside hospice  we transferred hospice patients from our san bernardino hospice to our riverside hospice 
in  we also relocated the remaining operations of our san bernardino hospice to a new location in palm springs  california 
operations of our round rock  texas hospice  which we acquired in  are being relocated to our austin  texas hospice location  which we opened in net patient service revenue net patient service revenue is the estimated net realizable revenue from patients  medicare  medicaid  commercial insurance  managed care payors and others for services rendered 
payors may determine that the services provided are not covered and do not qualify for a payment or  for commercial payors  that payments are subject to usual and customary rates 
to determine net patient service revenue  we adjust gross patient service revenue for estimated payment denials and contractual adjustments based on historical experience 
we recognize net patient service revenue in the month in which our services are delivered 
services provided under the medicare program represented approximately  and of our net patient service revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
services provided under medicaid programs represented approximately  and of our net patient service revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the payments we receive from the medicare and medicaid programs are calculated using daily or hourly rates for each of the four levels of care we deliver and are adjusted based on geographic location 
routine home care is the largest component of our gross patient service revenue  representing  and of gross patient service revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
inpatient care represented  and of gross patient service revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
continuous care and respite care  combined  represented most of the remaining  and of gross patient service revenue for these periods  respectively 
the principal factors that impact net patient service revenue are our average daily census  levels of care provided to our patients and changes in medicare and medicaid payment rates due to adjustments for inflation 
average daily census is affected by the number of patients referred by new and existing referral sources  and admitted into our hospice program  and average length of stay of those patients once admitted 
average length of stay is impacted by patients decisions of when to enroll in hospice care after diagnoses of terminal illnesses and  once enrolled  the length of the terminal illnesses 
our average hospice length of stay has increased from days in to days in see expenses and item business hospice industry and market opportunity 
payment rates under the medicare and medicaid programs are indexed for inflation annually  however  the increases have historically been less than actual inflation 
effective april   however  the base medicare daily payment rates for hospice care increased by five percent over the base rates then in effect  which has favorably impacted our profitability 
on october   the base medicare payment rates for hospice care increased by approximately over the base rates previously in effect 
on october   the base medicare payment rates for hospice care increased by approximately over the base rates previously in effect 
these rates were further adjusted by the hospice wage index 
in the future  reductions in the rate of increase in medicare and medicaid payments may have an adverse impact on our net patient service revenue and profitability 
see item business government regulation overview of government payments 
expenses because we generally receive fixed payments for our hospice services  our profitability is largely dependent on our ability to manage the expenses of providing hospice services 
we recognize expenses as incurred and classify expenses as either direct hospice care expenses or general and administrative expenses 
direct hospice care expenses primarily include direct patient care salaries and payroll taxes  pharmaceuticals  medical equipment and supplies  and inpatient costs 
length of stay impacts our direct hospice care expenses as a percentage of net patient service revenue because  if lengths of stay decline  direct hospice care expenses  which are often highest during the latter days of care for a patient  are spread against fewer days of care 
expenses are normally higher during the latter days of care  because patients generally require greater hospice services  including drugs  medical equipment and nursing care at that time due to their deteriorating medical condition 
these increased expenses reduce our profitability because we generally receive fixed payments for our hospice services 
in addition  cost pressures resulting from the use of more expensive forms of palliative care  including drugs and drug delivery systems  could negatively impact our profitability 
for our patients receiving nursing home care under a state medicaid program who elect hospice care under medicare or medicaid  we contract with nursing homes for the nursing homes provision to patients of room and board services 
the state must pay us  in addition to the applicable medicare or medicaid hospice daily or hourly rate  an amount equal to at least of the medicaid daily nursing home rate for room and board furnished to the patient by the nursing home 
under our standard nursing home contracts  we pay the nursing home for these room and board services at the medicaid daily nursing home rate 
we refer to these costs  net of medicaid payments  as nursing home costs  net 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
general and administrative expenses primarily include non patient care salaries  employee benefits and office leases 
the following table sets forth the percentage of net patient service revenue represented by the items included in direct hospice care expenses and general and administrative expenses exclusive of million in both and and million in reported separately as stock based compensation for the periods indicated year ended december  direct hospice care expenses salaries and payroll taxes pharmaceuticals medical equipment and supplies inpatient costs other including nursing home costs  net total general and administrative expenses salaries and benefits leases other including bad debts  travel  office supplies  printing and equipment rental total stock based and other compensation charges stock based compensation charges represent the difference between the exercise price of stock options granted and the deemed fair value of our common stock on the date of grant determined in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
and its related interpretations 
we recognize compensation charges over the vesting periods of the stock options using a graded amortization methodology in accordance with financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
for purposes of the period to period comparisons included in our results of operations  general and administrative expenses exclude these stock based compensation charges  which are reflected as a separate line item 
we have recorded deferred stock based compensation charges related to unvested stock options granted to employees and directors during and based on the number of outstanding stock options granted during and  we expect to amortize approximately million of deferred stock based compensation during and in future periods 
we expect to amortize this deferred stock based compensation in the following approximate amounts million during  million during  and million during and upon completion of our initial public offering  we forgave the repayment of promissory notes payable to us by richard r 
burnham  our chairman and chief executive officer  and david c 
gasmire  our president and chief operating officer 
we recorded a compensation charge of million in connection with the forgiveness of these notes in the fourth quarter of provision for income taxes our provision for income taxes consists of current and deferred federal and state income tax expenses 
for fiscal  we fully utilized our net operating loss carryforwards of million that existed at december  and were fully reserved by a valuation allowance 
accordingly  our effective tax rate was during  after considering the reversal of the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets 
we estimate that our effective tax rate will be approximately during as there are no remaining net operating loss carryforwards or remaining valuation allowances 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations included elsewhere in this annual report on form k and require the application of significant judgment by us  as a result  they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
in applying those policies  we use our judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates 
those estimates are based on our historical experience  our observance of trends in the industry and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
net patient service revenue and allowance for uncollectible accounts we report net patient service revenue at the estimated net realizable amounts from patients  medicare  medicaid  commercial insurance  managed care payors and others for services rendered 
payors may determine that the services provided are not covered and do not qualify for payment or  for commercial payors  that payments are subject to usual and customary rates 
to determine net patient service revenue  we adjust gross patient service revenue for estimated payment denials and contractual adjustments based on historical experience 
we recognize net patient service revenue in the month in which our services are delivered 
due to the complexity of the laws and regulations affecting the medicare and medicaid programs  there is a reasonable possibility that recorded estimates could change by a material amount in the future 
we maintain a policy for reserving for uncollectible accounts 
we calculate the allowance for uncollectible accounts based on a formula tied to the aging of accounts receivable by payor class 
we reserve for specific accounts that are determined to be uncollectible when such determinations are made 
accounts are written off when all collection efforts are exhausted 
insurance risks general and professional liability costs for the healthcare industry have increased and become more difficult to estimate 
in addition  insurance coverage for patient care liabilities and other risks has become more difficult to obtain 
insurance carriers often require companies to increase their liability retention levels and pay higher policy premiums for reduced coverage 
in our consolidated financial statements  we provide for liabilities associated with the uninsured portion of our general and professional liability risks  based on our experience  consultation with our attorneys and insurers  and our existing insurance coverage 
goodwill goodwill is the excess of the fair value of identifiable assets acquired over the purchase price in an acquisition 
prior to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  goodwill was amortized using the straight line method  generally over periods ranging from years 
after the adoption of sfas  we review goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter 
we determine the fair value of the reporting units using multiples of revenue 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value  then an indication of impairment exists 
the amount of the impairment would be determined by estimating the fair values of the tangible assets and liabilities  with the remaining fair value assigned to goodwill 
we have determined that the change in impairment testing did not have an impact on our results of operations or financial position but cannot guarantee that impairment will not impact our results of operations or financial position in the future

in  we fully utilized our net operating loss carryforwards of million 
at december   no valuation allowance was required for our net deferred tax assets because the assets met the criteria for recognition under sfas extraordinary item during  we repaid our senior subordinated notes and  in connection with the repayment  wrote off the unamortized discount relating to the notes 
this write off resulted in an extraordinary charge of million  or million net of taxes  representing of net patient service revenue 
net income net income increased million  from million in to million in gain on conversion of preferred securities the accumulated dividends on our series a  series b and series c convertible preferred stock were reversed in in connection with the conversion of the preferred stock into common stock upon completion of our initial public offering 
we recognized a gain to common stockholders totaling million that was used in the computation of basic net income per share 
liquidity and capital resources our principal liquidity requirements have historically been for debt service  hospice acquisitions and development plans  working capital and other capital expenditures 
we have financed these requirements primarily with borrowings under our credit facility  proceeds from the issuance of convertible preferred and common stock  warrants and debt  seller financing of hospice acquisitions  operating and capital leases  normal trade credit terms  and during and  with cash flows from operations 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and working capital of million

cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities in  and was primarily attributable to the increase in net income during those periods  partially offset by increases in non cash working capital requirements due to the growth of our business

net cash provided by financing activities in included million in net proceeds from our initial public offering 
we made a principal payment of million on our senior subordinated notes in june and a second principal payment of million in september we paid million and million in accrued interest on these notes in and  respectively 
we used million of the proceeds from our initial public offering to repay the notes in full in november in connection with our acquisition of a hospice program in november  we paid million in cash and issued a promissory note payable to the seller in the principal amount of million bearing interest at the rate of per annum 
in november  we paid the seller million of the outstanding principal balance  plus accrued and unpaid interest of million 
the remaining principal amount of million  plus accrued and unpaid interest  was paid in may in connection with our acquisition of seven hospice programs in  we paid an aggregate of million in cash and issued the following promissory notes payable to the sellers a promissory note in the principal amount of million

we repaid in full the principal balance of this note and all accrued and unpaid interest in the aggregate amount of million on june  and july   and a promissory note in the principal amount of million 
we repaid in full the principal balance of this note and all accrued and unpaid interest in the aggregate amount of million  with million of the principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest  paid on december  and the remaining principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest  paid on february  our credit agreement with heller healthcare finance  inc provides us with a million revolving line of credit for working capital  acquisitions and general corporate purposes 
borrowings outstanding under our revolving line of credit bear interest at fluctuating rates equal to above the prime rate of interest designated by citibank  with a floor of per annum 
our revolving line of credit will mature on october  as of february   we had no outstanding borrowings under our credit agreement or accrued and unpaid interest 
our revolving line of credit is secured by all of our accounts receivable and any other right to payment for goods sold or leased or services rendered by us and all other property in our possession or under our control 
we and our subsidiaries are subject to affirmative and negative covenants  including limitations on indebtedness  mergers  acquisitions and dispositions of assets  dividends  investments and liens  license maintenance covenants  and financial maintenance covenants 
we were in full compliance with our financial and other covenants as of february  we expect to let our line of credit expire in october of we do not foresee any additional credit needs in the near future 
we have entered into an agreement to purchase a new accounting system during we plan to capitalize million in related to this implementation 
contractual obligations payments due by period less than after total year years years years in thousands long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases      other long term obligations total contractual obligations      we expect that our principal liquidity requirements will be for working capital  development plans  anticipated hospice acquisitions  debt service and other anticipated capital expenditures 
we expect that our existing funds  cash flows from operations and borrowings under our credit agreement will be sufficient to fund our principal liquidity requirements for at least months following the date of this annual report on form k 
our future liquidity requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors  including payment for our services  regulatory changes and compliance with new regulations  expense levels  capital expenditures and future development of new hospice locations and acquisitions 
payment  legislative and regulatory changes we are highly dependent on payments from the medicare and medicaid programs 
these programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes  possible retroactive and prospective rate adjustments  administrative rulings  rate freezes and funding reductions 
reductions in amounts paid by these programs for our services or changes in methods or regulations governing payments for our services could materially adversely affect our net patient service revenue and profits 
inflation the healthcare industry is labor intensive 
wages and other expenses increase during periods of inflation and when labor shortages occur in the marketplace 
in addition  suppliers pass along rising costs to us in the form of higher prices 
we have implemented cost control measures designed to curb increases in operating expenses 
we have  to date  offset increases in operating costs by increasing patient census 
however  we cannot predict our ability to cover or offset future cost increases 
recent accounting pronouncements we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
business combinations sfas and statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  on january  sfas supercedes accounting principles board opinion no 
business combinations and statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for preacquisition contingencies of purchased enterprises and eliminates pooling of interests accounting for business combinations for transactions entered into after july  the adoption of sfas did not have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
sfas supercedes accounting principles board opinion no 
intangible assets which changes the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets 
the adoption of sfas eliminates the periodic amortization of goodwill and institutes an annual review of the fair value of goodwill 
the elimination of goodwill amortization would have increased net income by million and million  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
impairment of goodwill would be recorded if the fair value of the goodwill is less than the book value 
goodwill is reviewed at the reporting unit level  which is defined in sfas as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment 
we have defined our reporting units at the operating segment level 
sfas required the completion of the initial step of a transitional impairment test within six months of adoption 
any impairment loss resulting from the transitional impairment test would have been recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
subsequent impairment losses would be reflected in operating income 
we have determined that the change in impairment testing did not have an impact on our results of operations or financial position 
we completed the annual testing in the fourth quarter of and no impairments were required 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  on january  sfas supercedes statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas and the accounting and reporting provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions apb for the disposal of a segment of a business 
sfas establishes a single accounting model  based on the framework established in sfas  for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale and resolves implementation issues related to sfas by removing goodwill from its scope 
the adoption of sfas would impact our results of operations and financial position if a component of our business is designated as held for sale after adoption of sfas components designated as held for sale would be reported separately as discontinued operations with prior periods restated 
currently  we have not designated any components as held for sale under sfas  but could do so in the future 
in april  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections sfas  which is required to be applied in fiscal years beginning after may   with early application encouraged 
sfas rescinds statement of financial accounting standards no 
reporting gains and losses from extinguishment of debt 
sfas requires any gains or losses on extinguishment of debt that were classified as an extraordinary item in prior periods that do not meet the criteria in apb for classification as an extraordinary item be reclassified into income from operations 
we adopted the provisions of sfas on january  the impact of adoption of sfas will reduce income from operations by million for the year ended december  through the reclassification of the extraordinary loss on extinguishment of debt 
in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas  which is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  with early application encouraged 
sfas addresses the accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues task force issue no
