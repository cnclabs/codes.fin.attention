item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview during  our operating results continued to be impacted by the downturn within the semiconductor industry and in the general economy 
in early  the most severe cyclical downturn in the semiconductor industry began  resulting from a buildup of inventory in the supply chain and weak end demand 
since that time  we have started to see a gradual  but uneven recovery within the industry and lsi 
the economic outlook remains uncertain as any geopolitical factors  such as additional terrorist activities or armed conflict  may adversely affect the global economy  which may affect our recovery in and adversely impact our operating results and financial condition 
total consolidated revenues for the year ended december   increased million or to billion in from billion in revenues from the semiconductor segment decreased by million while revenue from the storage systems segment increased by million 
the decrease in semiconductor revenues was primarily attributable to continuing weak economic conditions 
this decline was offset in part by a full year of revenues from c cube microsystems  inc c cube and from raid products  which became a part of the semiconductor segment with the acquisitions of c cube and the raid division of american megatrends  inc ami in may and august  respectively 
revenues from our storage systems segment increased due to overall increased demand for modular storage products  sales to a new master distributor and revenues from the mylex business unit  which was acquired from ibm and primarily became a part of the storage systems segment from august  the consolidated gross profit margin percentage increased to in from in this increase was mainly due to higher total revenues accompanied by lower manufacturing variances for the semiconductor segment  lower compensation related expenses due to a decrease in average headcount and lower additional excess inventory and related charges in as compared to operating expenses decreased to million in from billion in the decrease is primarily the result of lower charges for restructuring of operations and other items  net in compared to a charge of million for restructuring of operations and other items  net  was incurred in  consisting of a charge of million as the result of a set of actions announced by us to reduce costs and streamline operations  and a gain of million for other items  including a gain on sale of cdma handset product technology 
a charge of million was recorded in see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements referred to hereafter as notes 
in addition  amortization of intangibles decreased by million in primarily as a result of the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets on january  see note of the notes  offset by additional amortization of intangible assets acquired during charges for acquired in process research and development ipr d and amortization of non cash deferred stock compensation also decreased by million in finally  research and development r d expenses decreased while selling  general and administrative sg a expenses decreased during as compared to as a result of the restructuring actions taken in and these cost reductions were partially offset by continued r d and sg a expenses incurred for the former c cube  ami raid and mylex businesses  which are included in our consolidated financial statements from may   august  and august   respectively 
see note of the notes 
interest expense increased by million to million in from million in the increase is due to increased debt outstanding in due to the issuance of million of convertible subordinated notes in october  offset by a reduction in the effective interest rate payable on the convertible subordinated notes as a result of the interest rate swap transactions entered into in the second quarter of  which have effectively converted the fixed rate payments on a portion of the convertible subordinated notes to floating rates 
see note of the notes 
interest income and other  net  was million in and was comprised of interest income of million and a net gain of million on the repurchase of a portion of the convertible subordinated notes see note of the notes  offset in part by a net write down of certain equity investments by million due to impairment considered by our management to be other than temporary 
see note of the notes 
for the year ended december   we recorded a net loss of million  or loss per diluted share  compared to a net loss of million  or loss per diluted share  for the same period in stock option exchange program 
on august   we filed  with the securities and exchange commission  an offer to exchange stock options outstanding under the equity incentive plan and the non statutory stock option plan for new options 
under the exchange offer  eligible employees had the opportunity to exchange eligible stock options for the promise to grant new options in the future under the non statutory stock option plan 
directors and executive officers of lsi were not eligible to participate in this program 
the exchange offer expired september   and we accepted an aggregate of  options for exchange 
on march   we granted a new option that covered shares of our company s common stock for every shares covered by an option an employee elected to exchange 
the exercise price per share of the new options was equal to the fair market value of our company s common stock on the new grant date 
see note of the notes 
the exchange program did not result in the recording of any compensation expense in our statement of operations 
significant acquisitions and other major transactions 
we are continually exploring strategic acquisitions that build upon our existing library of intellectual property  human capital and engineering talent  and increase our leadership position in the markets where we operate 
all of our acquisitions in  and were accounted for as purchases and accordingly  the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the results of operations were included in our consolidated financial statements as of the effective date of each acquisition through the end of the period 
the transactions are summarized below 
there were no significant differences between the accounting policies of lsi and those of the companies acquired 
see note of the notes 
on august   we finalized an asset purchase agreement with international business machines corporation ibm 
under the agreement  we acquired certain tangible and intangible assets associated with ibm s mylex business unit 
this acquisition is expected to enhance product offerings in the expanding entry level storage systems space within the storage systems segment and the pci raid offering in the semiconductor segment 
the details of this acquisition are summarized below 
acquisition purchase identified deferred company date price consideration ipr d goodwill intangibles compensation amounts in millions mylex business august cash  including direct unit of ibm acquisition costs of million during  we acquired c cube microsystems inc and certain tangible and intangible assets associated with the redundant array of independent disks  or raid  business of american megatrends  inc both these acquisitions became a part of our semiconductor segment 
acquisition purchase identified deferred company date price consideration ipr d goodwill intangibles compensation amounts in millions c cube may million shares  million options  million warrants raid division of august cash  ami million restricted shares in april  we announced a co development and foundry supply agreement with taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company ltd 
tsmc 
this agreement is part of our strategy to outsource  that is to procure a larger portion of our wafer requirements from external sources 
as a result of our joint development efforts with tsmc we anticipate purchasing  consistent with our outsourcing strategy  such portion of our wafer volume requirements based on the gflx process technology that we do not manufacture ourselves 
in addition  we anticipate being able to defer the need to expand our manufacturing capacity for the gflx technology beyond the time when products designed for that technology would begin volume production 
we have also completed the definition of a nanometer system on a chip process platform with tsmc and its other leading edge technology customers 
this platform is designed to enable an advanced capability for the deployment of our rapidchip products and high volume standard cell asics 
these advanced process technologies allow for greater circuit density and increased functionality on a single chip 
this technology is in the final stages of development with prototype deployment expected in during  we acquired a division of neomagic corporation neomagic  a division of cacheware  inc cacheware  intraserver technology  inc 
intraserver  datapath systems  inc datapath  paravoice technologies  inc paravoice and syntax systems  inc 
syntax 
syntax and the division of cacheware became a part of the storage systems segment while all the other acquisitions in became a part of the semiconductor segment 
acquisition purchase identified deferred company date price consideration ipr d goodwill intangibles compensation amounts in millions division of april cash neomagic division of april cash cacheware intraserver may million shares  million options datapath july million shares  million options paravoice october cash syntax november million shares  million options during  the neomagic research project was abandoned and the remaining intangibles and goodwill recorded in connection with the project were written off 
see the discussion under restructuring of operations and other items for details 
where more than one significant factor contributed to changes in results from year to year  we have quantified such factors throughout the management s discussion analysis where practicable 
results of operations revenues year ended december  in millions semiconductor segment    storage systems segment consolidated    there were no significant intersegment revenues during the periods presented 
compared to total consolidated revenues for increased million or as compared to revenues for the semiconductor segment decreased million or in as compared to the previous year 
communications revenues dropped significantly in due to weak demand from our telecommunications customers resulting from overcapacity in end markets 
revenues decreased slightly in the consumer product group as revenue from set top box semiconductors weakened substantially  primarily due to competitive factors  and revenue from videogame semiconductors decreased slightly compared to the prior year 
the decline in the consumer group was offset in part by increased revenues from dvd and cable modem products due to growth in those markets and the benefit of a full year of revenue from c cube  which became a part of our consolidated financial statements with its acquisition in may revenues for the storage components group increased year on year mainly because of a full year of revenues from raid products  which became a part of our consolidated financial statements with the acquisition of ami s raid business in august revenues for the storage systems segment increased million or in from the increase was due to overall increased demand for modular storage products  sales to a new master distributor and greater demand from key market segments such as energy and government 
revenues in also increased due to additional revenues from the mylex business unit  which was acquired in august and became primarily a part of the storage systems segment 
we expect revenues to decline to between million and million in the first quarter of  primarily due to a greater than normal seasonal weakness in consumer products  particularly in video games 
revenue in our communications business is also expected to decline in the first quarter  as telecommunications end markets remain weak and inventory levels of some customers are adequate to meet their production requirements in the first quarter 
the first quarter is seasonally the weakest period for our consumer business  and we expect that the first quarter of will represent the company s low point of revenues for the fiscal year 
we expect revenue to increase in the second quarter of as demand is expected to be up in that quarter for our video game semiconductors  combined with moderate growth expected for our communications and storage products in that period 
compared to total revenues decreased to billion in from billion in revenues for the semiconductor segment decreased to billion in from billion in the decrease was primarily attributable to decreased demand  most notably for semiconductor products used in broadband access  networking infrastructure and storage infrastructure applications  reflecting the economic downturn in the semiconductor industry 
the decline in revenues was offset partially by additional revenues from c cube and the raid division of ami purchased in see note of the notes 
revenues for the storage systems segment decreased to million in from million in due to decreased demand reflecting industry declines for all products sold in the storage systems segment 
significant customers 
the following table summarizes the number of our significant customers  each of whom accounted for or more of our revenues  along with the percentage of revenues they individually represent on a consolidated basis and by segment year ended december  semiconductor segment number of significant customers none greater than percentage of segment revenues n a storage systems segment number of significant customers percentage of segment revenues       consolidated number of significant customers percentage of consolidated revenues revenues by geography 
the following table summarizes our revenues by geography year ended december  in millions revenues north america  japan pan asia europe total    in  revenues increased in north america  japan and asia while they declined in europe as compared to revenues were lower in europe in as compared to mainly due to the weakness in demand for semiconductors used in communications products in that region 
revenues in pan asia increased in as compared to as a result of the acquisition of c cube in the second quarter of see note of the notes 
the decline in domestic revenues in as compared to is mainly because of the economic downturn in the united states 
operating costs and expenses 
key elements of the consolidated statements of operations for the respective segments are as follows gross profit margin year ended december  in millions semiconductor segment  percentage of segment revenues storage systems segment percentage of segment revenues consolidated  percentage of revenues we have advanced wafer manufacturing operations in oregon  which is our primary manufacturing site  and japan 
we also acquire wafers from foundries in other locations 
utilizing a diversity of manufacturing locations allows us to better manage potential disruption in the manufacturing process due to economic and geographic risks associated with each location 
compared to the consolidated gross profit margin as a percentage of revenues increased to in from in the gross profit margin as a percentage of revenues for the semiconductor segment increased to from  while for the storage systems segment  it increased to in from in the following factors were primarily responsible for the improvement in gross profit margins in as compared to o lower additional excess inventory and related charges of million in as compared to million in the charges in impacted the semiconductor segment and were primarily associated with underutilization charges related to a partial idling of our fabrication facilities due to decreased demand 
the additional excess inventory and related charges of million in  including a charge of million for the storage systems segment  as discussed in the compared to section below  o lower manufacturing variances  due to improved capacity utilization and improved product yields  for the semiconductor segment during o lower compensation related expenses due to a decrease in average headcount in as compared to  and o increased revenues in the storage systems segment 
even though gross profit margins improved in as compared to  semiconductor segment revenues were lower in as compared to we expect our consolidated gross margin to be in the range of to in the first quarter of  as a result of expected lower revenues compared to the prior quarter 
compared to the gross profit margin percentage for decreased to from in on a consolidated basis  reflecting lower gross profit margins in both of our segments 
the gross profit margin percentage for the semiconductor segment was in compared to in the decrease in the semiconductor segment primarily reflects the economic downturn as evidenced by o decreased revenue for higher margin products  o higher manufacturing variances and period costs as a percentage of revenues  and o additional excess inventory and related charges of million in the additional excess inventory and related charges were primarily associated with underutilization charges related to a temporary idling of our fabrication facilities  coupled with inventory production in anticipation of the closing of our colorado springs fabrication facility see note of the notes and a sudden and significant decrease in forecasted revenue  and was calculated in accordance with our policy  which is primarily based on inventory levels in excess of months and use of management judgment for each specific product 
the gross profit margin percentage for the storage systems segment was in compared to in the decrease is primarily attributable to decreased revenue for higher margin products and additional excess inventory and related charges of approximately million recorded during our operating environment  combined with the resources required to operate in the semiconductor and storage systems industries  require that we manage a variety of factors 
these factors include  among other things o competitive pricing pressures  o product mix  o factory capacity and utilization  o manufacturing yields  o availability of certain raw materials  o terms negotiated with third party subcontractors  and o foreign currency fluctuations 
these and other factors could have a significant effect on our gross profit margin in future periods 
research and development year ended december  in millions semiconductor segment percentage of segment revenues storage systems segment percentage of segment revenues consolidated percentage of revenues compared to consolidated r d expenses decreased million or in as compared to during the same period  r d expenses for the semiconductor segment decreased million or 
the decrease was primarily attributable to the cost cutting measures implemented as part of the restructuring actions in and see note of the notes 
the decrease was offset in part by the following o a lower benefit of million was recorded to r d in as compared to million recorded in this benefit is associated with the technology transfer agreement entered into with silterra in malaysia during see note of the notes  o continued r d expenses for the former c cube and ami raid businesses  which are a part of the semiconductor segment and included in our consolidated financial statements from may  and august   respectively  and o expenditures related to continued development of advanced sub micron products and process technologies  which includes the development of rapidchiptm 
rapidchip was one of the technologies under development in the current year 
rapidchip products combine the high density  high performance and proven intellectual property benefits of cell based asics with the advantages of field programmable gate arrays fpgas  such as customization and faster time to market 
rapidchip has performance comparable to cell based asics at a cost significantly lower than fpgas 
we believe that this will be one of the most competitive products in the high density chip market segment for many years 
we expect to begin shipping rapidchip products in the second half of  although we do not expect it to contribute significantly to our consolidated revenues until r d expenses for the storage systems segment increased million or in as compared to this increase is mainly due to continuing r d expenses for the former mylex business unit of ibm  which was acquired in and is included in our consolidated financial statements from august  as a percentage of revenues  consolidated r d expenses decreased to in from in r d expenses for the semiconductor segment decreased to of revenues in from in this decline is a result of lower r d spending as discussed above offset in part by lower segment revenues in as compared to r d expenses as a percentage of revenues for the storage systems segment decreased to in from in as a result of an increase in revenues offset in part by an increase in r d expenses in compared to r d expenses increased to million during as compared to million in on a consolidated basis 
r d expenses for the semiconductor segment increased to million in from million in the increase was attributable to the following factors o increased r d activities based on new r d projects  including those acquired in business combinations in see note of the notes  and o expenditures related to the continued development of advanced sub micron products and process technologies 
the increase was offset in part by million and million of research and development benefits associated with a technology transfer agreement entered into with silterra in malaysia during and  respectively 
see note of the notes 
r d expenses for the storage systems segment increased to million in from million in the increase is primarily attributable to higher compensation related expenses due to an increase in average headcount during the periods presented 
selling  general and administrative year ended december  in millions semiconductor segment percentage of segment revenues storage systems segment percentage of segment revenues consolidated percentage of revenues compared to consolidated sg a expenses decreased million or in as compared to sg a expenses for the semiconductor segment decreased million or as compared to the decreases on a consolidated basis and for the semiconductor segment were primarily attributable to the various cost cutting measures implemented in and see note of the notes 
the decrease was offset in part by continued sg a expenses for the former c cube and ami raid businesses  which were added as part of the semiconductor segment and included in our consolidated financial statements in the second and third quarters of sg a expenses for the storage systems segment decreased million or in as compared to the prior year 
this is a result of cost cutting measures implemented in and and discussed further in note of the notes  offset in part by continuing expenses for the mylex business unit added to the storage systems segment and our consolidated financial statements as of august  see note of the notes 
as a percentage of revenues  sg a expenses decreased to in from in on a consolidated basis  while for the semiconductor segment  sg a expenses decreased to from over the same period 
the decrease is a result of savings from sg a cost cutting measures as discussed above  offset in part by lower segment revenues in as compared to for the storage systems segment  sg a expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to in from in the decrease is a result of savings in sg a expenses from the cost cutting measures discussed above  the impact of a master distributor arrangement started in and higher revenues in as compared to compared to sg a expenses in of million were relatively flat as compared to million in on a consolidated basis 
sg a expenses for the semiconductor segment decreased by to million in from million in sg a expenses for the storage systems segment increased by to million in from million in sg a expenses were impacted primarily by the following factors in o continued sg a expenses for the former c cube and ami raid business added to the semiconductor segment and our consolidated financial statements as of may  and august   respectively  and o an increase in compensation related expenses for the storage systems segment due to an increase in average headcount during the above increases were offset in part by the savings from various cost reduction programs in both our operating segments in these include  among other things  a reduction in workforce  temporary cessation of annual merit increases and bonuses  and shutdowns of operations during the year 
see note of the notes 
acquired in process research and development we recorded a charge of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively associated with ipr d in connection with various acquisitions 
the details at the acquisition date are summarized in the table below acquisition revenue projections company date ipr d discount rate extend through royalty rate dollar amounts in millions mylex unit of ibm august raid division of ami august c cube may paravoice october intraserver may datapath july division of neomagic april division of cacheware april the amounts of ipr d were determined by identifying research projects for which technological feasibility had not been established and no alternative future uses existed as of the respective acquisition dates 
the value of the projects identified to be in progress was generally determined by estimating the future cash flows from the projects once commercially feasible  discounting the net cash flows back to their present value and then applying a percentage of completion to the calculated value 
the net cash flows from the identified projects were based on estimates of revenues  cost of revenues  research and development costs  selling general and administrative costs and applicable income taxes for the projects 
total revenues for the projects are expected to extend through the dates noted in the above table by acquisition 
these projections were based on estimates of market size and growth  expected trends in technology and the expected timing of new product introductions by our competitors and us 
these estimates do not account for any potential synergies that may be realized as a result of the acquisition and are in line with industry averages and growth estimates 
percentage of completion 
the percentage of completion for the projects for the purchases of the mylex unit of ibm  the raid business from ami  c cube  paravoice  cacheware and a division of neomagic were determined based on research and development expenses incurred as of the acquisition dates for the projects as a percentage of total research and development expenses to bring the projects to technological feasibility 
the percentage of completion for the projects for the purchases of intraserver and datapath were determined using milestones representing management s estimate of effort  value added and degree of difficulty of the portion of the projects completed as of the acquisition dates  as compared to the remaining research and development to be completed to bring the projects to technological feasibility 
the development process is grouped into three phases  with each phase containing between one and five milestones 
the three phases are o researching the market requirements and the engineering architecture and feasibility studies  o design and verification milestones  and o prototyping and testing the product both internal and customer testing 
discount and royalty rates 
the discount rate is used for the projects to account for the risks associated with the inherent uncertainties surrounding the successful development of the ipr d  market acceptance of the technology  the useful life of the technology  the profitability level of such technology and the uncertainty of technological advances  which could impact the estimates described above 
we applied a royalty rate by project by acquisition to operating income to attribute value for dependency on predecessor core technologies

see the discussion under restructuring of operations and other items for details 
development of the above noted technologies that have not yet been completed remains a significant risk to us due to the remaining effort to achieve technological feasibility  rapidly changing customer markets and significant competitive threats from numerous companies 
failure to bring the product to market in a timely manner could adversely affect our sales and profitability in the future 
additionally  the value of other intangible assets acquired may become impaired 
restructuring of operations and other items we recorded approximately million in restructuring of operations and other items for the year ended december   consisting of million for restructuring of operations  and a gain of million for other items including the gain on sale of cdma handset product technology 
restructuring of operations and other items were primarily included in the semiconductor segment  the restructuring expense included in the storage systems segment was not significant 
restructuring and impairment of long lived assets in the first quarter of  we announced a set of actions to reduce costs and streamline operations 
these actions included a worldwide reduction in workforce  downsizing our manufacturing operations in tsukuba  japan  and the decision to exit cdma handset product technology 
during the three months ended march   we recorded a restructuring charge for severance for approximately  employees worldwide and exit costs primarily associated with cancelled contracts and operating leases 
as a result of the restructuring actions  we recorded fixed asset write downs due to impairment in the us and japan for assets that will be disposed of by sale 
in the second quarter of  we completed the sale of cdma handset product technology to a third party  recognizing a net gain of million 
during the fourth quarter of  we reversed approximately million of previously accrued restructuring expenses 
as a result of our decision to terminate fewer employees than the original plan contemplated in tsukuba  japan  we reversed previously accrued restructuring expenses for termination benefits including outplacement costs and certain contract termination fees of million 
this was offset by additional expense accruals of million for costs related to the previously announced closure of the colorado springs fabrication facility 
certain other reclassifications were made between lease and contract terminations and facility closure and other exit costs to reflect changes in management estimates for the remaining costs for these activities 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed 
the adoption did not have a significant effect on our financial position and results of operations 
assets held for sale of million and million were included as a component of prepaid expenses and other current assets as of december  and  respectively 
in september  we recorded million of additional fixed asset write downs to reflect the decrease in the fair market value of the assets during the period 
assets classified as held for sale are not depreciated 
the fair value of assets determined to be impaired was the result of independent appraisals and the use of management estimates 
given that current market conditions for the sale of older fabrication facilities and related equipment may fluctuate  there can be no assurance that we will realize the current net carrying value for the assets 
we reassess the realizability of the carrying value of these assets at the end of each quarter until the assets are sold or otherwise disposed of and additional adjustments may be necessary 
we are making appropriate efforts to sell assets held for sale within the next twelve months 
the following table sets forth our restructuring reserves as of december   which are included in other accrued liabilities on the balance sheet balance at release of utilized balance at december  restructuring reserve and during december  expense reclassifications in thousands write down of excess assets a      lease terminations and maintenance contracts c      facility closure and other exit costs c     payments to employees for severance b 
    total      a amounts utilized in reflect a non cash write down of fixed assets in the us and japan due to impairment of million and cash payments for machinery and equipment decommissioning costs of million 
the fixed asset write downs were accounted for as a reduction of the assets and did not result in a liability

s and selling costs for assets held for sale 
b amounts utilized represent cash severance payments to approximately  employees during the year ended december  the million balance as of december  will be paid during c amounts utilized represent cash payments 
other items we recorded a net gain of million in other items during the first quarter of  which consisted of a nonrefundable deposit paid to us in the first quarter of related to the termination of the agreement to sell the colorado springs fabrication facility during  offset in part by certain costs associated with maintaining cdma handset product technology held for sale 
we recorded approximately million in restructuring of operations and other items for the year ended december   consisting of million for restructuring of operations and million for other items 
restructuring of operations and other items were primarily included in the semiconductor segment  the restructuring expense included in the storage systems segment was not significant 
restructuring and impairment of long lived assets in september  we announced the consolidation of us manufacturing operations to gresham  oregon  including the transfer of process research and development from santa clara  california to gresham  oregon 
we also announced the closure of certain assembly activities in fremont  california  which would be transferred offshore 
as a result of these actions  we recorded a restructuring charge of million  including fixed asset write downs due to impairment as a result of the restructuring actions in the us  losses on operating leases for equipment and facilities  severance for approximately employees across multiple company activities and functions in the us  europe  japan and asia pacific  as well as other exit costs 
in april  we announced the closure of our colorado springs fabrication facility 
this facility was closed in the fourth quarter of we recorded an impairment charge of million relating to the facility  of which approximately million was recorded in cost of sales and million was recorded in restructuring charges 
the restructuring charges consisted of fixed asset write downs due to impairment as a result of the restructuring actions  losses on operating leases for equipment  severance for approximately manufacturing employees and other exit costs 
during the second quarter of  we recorded an additional million in restructuring charges primarily associated with the write down of fixed assets due to impairment as a result of the restructuring actions in the us  japan and hong kong that will be disposed of and severance charges for approximately employees across multiple company activities and functions in the us  europe and asia pacific 
the following table sets forth our restructuring reserves as of december   which are included in other accrued liabilities on the balance sheet restructuring utilized balance at expense during december  in thousands write down of excess assets a    lease terminations and maintenance contracts c    facility closure and other exit costs c    payments to employees for severance b   total    a amounts utilized in reflect a non cash write down of fixed assets in the us  japan and hong kong due to impairment of million and cash payments for machinery and equipment decommissioning costs of million 
the fixed asset write downs were accounted for as a reduction of the assets and did not result in a liability 
the million balance as of december  relates to machinery and equipment decommissioning costs in the us b amounts utilized represent cash payments related to the severance of approximately  employees during the year ended december  c amounts utilized represent cash payments 
other items we recorded approximately million in other items during as follows o million in charges associated with the write down of intangible assets due to impairment 
the majority of the intangible assets were originally acquired in the purchase of a division of neomagic in the second quarter of o million in charges primarily consisting of the write down of an investment in a marketable equity security and related purchased intellectual property 
we recorded restructuring of operations and other items  only in the semiconductor segment  of million in this was primarily related to the loss on an agreement entered into with a third party to outsource certain testing services previously performed by us at our fremont  california facility 
amortization of intangibles we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets on january  as a result  goodwill is no longer amortized  but is instead tested for impairment annually or sooner if circumstances indicate that it may no longer be recoverable 
in addition  intangible assets acquired prior to july  that do not meet the criteria for recognition under sfas no 
 business combinations have been reclassified to goodwill

upon adoption  we completed the transitional goodwill impairment assessment required by sfas no 
and concluded that goodwill was not impaired as of january  the annual impairment test was performed at december  and it indicated that goodwill was not impaired 
factors that could trigger an impairment review sooner than annually are discussed in the critical accounting policies section later in this annual report on form k 
among those factors  a significant decline in our market capitalization for an extended period of time  relative to net book value could trigger the need for an impairment review and goodwill may potentially become impaired at a future date 
goodwill is tested for impairment by reporting unit as defined by sfas no 
our reporting units are semiconductor and storage systems 
the impairment testing is performed in a two step process 
the first step requires comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its net book value 
an impairment exists if the fair value of the reporting unit is lower than its net book value 
the second step of the process is only performed if an impairment exists  as it involves measuring the actual impairment to goodwill 
we use independent appraisals and use of management estimates to perform the first step of the goodwill impairment test 
two methodologies were used to obtain the fair value for each reporting unit as of december  discounted cash flow and market multiple 
the discounted cash flow and market multiple methodologies include assumptions about future conditions within our reporting units and related industries 
these assumptions include estimates of future market size and growth  expected trends in technology  timing of new product introductions by our competitors and us  and the nature of the industry in which comparable companies and we operate 
if significant changes to these assumptions occur  goodwill could become impaired in the future 
the valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill is considered to be a critical accounting policy to us and is discussed further later in this annual report on form k 
amortization of goodwill and other intangibles decreased to million in from million in the decrease is primarily attributable to the adoption of sfas nos 
and as discussed above  offset by the additional intangible assets and related amortization recorded in connection with two acquisitions during the second half of we had approximately million of intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  which will continue to amortize as of december  amortization of goodwill and other intangibles increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily related to additional goodwill and other intangibles and related amortization recorded in connection with the acquisitions of c cube and the raid business from ami in see note of the notes 
amortization of non cash deferred stock compensation amortization of non cash deferred stock compensation is due to non cash deferred stock compensation recorded in connection with acquisitions completed after july  the acquisitions for which deferred stock compensation and related amortization were recorded consisted of an acquisition in the fourth quarter of  c cube and the raid business from ami in  and datapath and syntax in no deferred stock compensation was recorded in connection with the acquisition of the mylex business unit in we amortize deferred stock compensation ratably over the vesting period 
amortization of non cash deferred stock compensation of million  million and million was recorded in  and  respectively 
at december   the deferred stock compensation that remained was million  which is expected to be amortized over the next three years 
the balance of deferred stock compensation that remained to be amortized at december   was million 
see note to the notes 
interest expense interest expense increased by million to million in from million in the increase is due to additional interest expense incurred on the increased debt outstanding in due to the issuance of the million of convertible subordinated notes issued in october see note of the notes 
the increase was offset in part by a reduction in the effective interest rate payable on the convertible subordinated notes as a result of the interest rate swap transactions the swaps entered into in the second quarter of we entered into the swaps with various investment banks in june the swaps effectively convert fixed interest payments on a portion of our convertible subordinated notes to libor based floating rates 
the swaps are intended to better manage interest rate risk on our investment portfolio see note of the notes  which reprices more frequently than our debt portfolio  and to better manage asset and liability mismatches 
the swaps qualify for hedge accounting treatment 
see note of the notes 
at december   a notional amount of million of our convertible subordinated notes was covered by the swaps 
interest expense increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily attributable to increased debt outstanding in due to the issuance of the million of convertible subordinated notes issued in october see note of the notes 
interest income and other interest income and other  net  was million in as compared to million in interest income decreased to million in from million in the decrease in interest income is attributable to lower returns due to the declining interest rate environment and lower invested cash balances in as compared to other expense of million in included the following o a gain of million on the repurchase of a portion of the convertible subordinated notes  net of the write off of debt issuance costs associated with the issuance of the notes 
during the third and fourth quarters of  we repurchased and retired million of the million convertible subordinated notes issued in and million of the million convertible subordinated notes issued in effective january   we early adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections related to extinguishment of debt 
as a result  the gain on the repurchase of debt is included in interest income and other  net  in the statement of operations see note of the notes  o a net write down of certain equity investments for million due to impairment considered by our management to be other than temporary 
see note of the notes  and o a gain on miscellaneous asset sales  the cost of purchased option contracts  bank fees and other miscellaneous expenses 
interest income and other  net  decreased to million in from million in the decrease was primarily attributable to the following events in  which were absent in o million write down of equity investments due to impairment considered to be other than temporary  net of a million pre tax gain associated with equity securities of a certain technology company that was acquired by another technology company see note of the notes  o million of lower interest income due to lower average balances of interest generating cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and lower interest rates in  o the write off of debt issuance costs of approximately million associated with the repayment of bank debt and the restructuring of a master lease and security agreement see notes and of the notes  and o the cost of purchased option contracts  bank fees and other miscellaneous expenses 
in  we recorded a pre tax gain of million on the sale of a us facility in fremont  california 
this gain was absent in gain on sale of equity securities during  we sold investments in certain marketable equity securities for million in the open market  realizing a pre tax gain of approximately million 
during  we sold investments in certain marketable equity securities for million in the open market  realizing a pre tax gain of approximately million 
in  we also recognized a million pre tax gain associated with equity securities of a certain technology company that was acquired by another technology company 
provision for income taxes in  we recorded an income tax expense of million  which represents an effective tax rate of approximately 
this rate differs from the us statutory rate primarily due to losses of our foreign subsidiaries  which are not benefited or are benefited at lower rates  foreign tax expense in certain jurisdictions  and reductions in the value of our deferred tax assets with the corresponding charge to income tax expense of approximately million 
the effect of these charges was partially offset by the expanded net operating loss carryback provided by a law change in  as well as the reversal of taxes previously accrued and the conclusion of a federal income tax audit with the internal revenue service for the income tax years through in  we recorded an income tax benefit of million  which represents an effective tax rate of approximately 
this rate differs from the us statutory rate primarily due to losses of our foreign subsidiaries  which are not benefited or are benefited at lower rates  foreign tax expense in certain jurisdictions  net operating losses not currently benefited  and items related to acquisitions  which are non deductible for tax purposes 
the rate for was approximately 
the rate for was higher than the us statutory rate primarily due to non deductible transaction costs related to acquisitions 
minority interest in net income of subsidiary minority interest in net income of subsidiary was not significant for the periods presented 
the changes in minority interest were attributable to the composition of earnings and losses in one of our international affiliates for each of the respective years 
financial condition  capital resources and liquidity cash  cash equivalents and short term investments decreased to million at december  from billion at december  the decrease is mainly due to higher net cash used in investing activities and cash paid for the repurchase of the convertible subordinated notes see note of the notes  partially offset by higher net cash provided by operating activities in as compared to working capital 
working capital decreased by million to billion at december  from billion as of december  working capital in was impacted by the following activities o we completed two acquisitions during the second half of for a total of million in cash  including million incurred for direct acquisition costs  o during the third and fourth quarters  we repurchased and retired million of the million convertible subordinated notes issued in and million of the million convertible subordinated notes issued in  recognizing a net pre tax gain of million 
the net cash outflow as a result of these repurchases was million 
see note of the notes  o inventories decreased by million due to increased sales in the fourth quarter of as compared to the same period of  o prepaid expenses and other current assets declined by million primarily due to a further write down of assets held for sale to current fair market values  miscellaneous asset sales  offset by other non cash transfers from non current assets and deposits to prepaid expenses and other current assets in association with two operating leases see notes and of the notes  and o current deferred tax assets  net of current deferred tax liabilities decreased by million due to changes in the underlying temporary differences and increases in the valuation allowance see note of the notes 
the decrease in working capital was offset  in part  by the following o accounts receivable increased by million to million at december   from million at december  this increase is mainly attributable to increased revenues in the fourth quarter of as compared to the fourth quarter of  o accounts payable was lower by million at december   as compared to december  due to lower purchases in the fourth quarter of as compared to the same period of  o other accrued liabilities were lower by million at december   as compared to december   due to changes in merger related accruals and restructuring reserves that decreased due to cash payments and reserve reversals see note of the notes and lower expense accruals in  and o lower income taxes payable due to lower tax expense recorded in and a net income tax benefit recorded in cash and cash equivalents provided by operating activities 
during  we generated million of net cash and cash equivalents from operating activities compared to million generated in the increase in cash and cash equivalents provided by operating activities was the result of income before non cash adjustments to our net loss in as compared to a loss before non cash adjustments to our net loss in  offset by changes in working capital for the periods presented 
cash decreased by million in as compared to an increase of million in the prior year due to changes in working capital 
cash and cash equivalents used in investing activities 
cash and cash equivalents used in investing activities was million in as compared to million used in the primary investing activities during as compared to the prior year were as follows o purchases of debt and equity securities available for sale  net of maturities and sales in as compared to net sales in  o lower purchases of property and equipment  net of retirements  o lower additional investments in non current assets and deposits in  and o lower cash paid in towards acquisition of companies 
net capital additions were million in as compared to million in we believe that maintaining technological leadership in the highly competitive worldwide semiconductor manufacturing industry requires access to advanced manufacturing capacity 
we expect total capital expenditures to be under million in our focus is on establishing strategic supplier alliances with foundry semiconductor manufacturers  which enables us to have access to advanced manufacturing capacity  and reduces our capital spending requirements 
cash and cash equivalents used in provided by financing activities 
cash and cash equivalents used in financing activities during were million as compared to million provided in the decrease is primarily attributable to the lack of new borrowings in as compared to million borrowed in  net of debt issuance costs and payment of million towards the repurchase of the convertible subordinated notes in see note of the notes  accompanied by lower net cash proceeds from our employee stock option and purchase plans in as compared to during the third and fourth quarters of  we repurchased and retired million of the million convertible subordinated notes issued in and million of the million convertible subordinated notes issued in  recognizing a net pre tax gain of million 
the gain on the repurchase of debt is included in interest income and other  net  in the statement of operations 
from time to time  we may buy back additional convertible subordinated notes 
on october   we issued million of convertible subordinated notes the convertible notes due in the convertible notes are subordinated to all existing and future senior debt  are convertible at the holder s option  at any time after days following issuance  into shares of our company s common stock at a conversion price of per share 
the convertible notes are redeemable at our option  in whole or in part  on at least days notice at any time on or after november  each holder of the convertible notes has the right to cause us to repurchase all of such holder s convertible notes at of their principal amount plus accrued interest upon the occurrence of any fundamental change  which includes a transaction or event such as an exchange offer  liquidation  tender offer  consolidation  merger or combination 
on february   we issued million of convertible subordinated notes the convertible notes due in the convertible notes are subordinated to all existing and future senior debt  are convertible at the holder s option  at any time after days following issuance  into shares of our company s common stock at a conversion price of per share 
the convertible notes are redeemable at our option  in whole or in part  on at least days notice at any time on or after february  each holder of the convertible notes has the right to cause us to repurchase all of such holder s convertible notes at of their principal amount plus accrued interest upon the occurrence of any fundamental change  which includes a transaction or event such as an exchange offer  liquidation  tender offer  consolidation  merger or combination 
during march  we issued million of convertible subordinated notes the convertible notes due in the convertible notes are subordinated to all existing and future senior debt  are convertible at the option of the holder  at any time after days following issuance  into shares of our company s common stock at a conversion price of per share 
the convertible notes are redeemable at our option  in whole or in part  on at least days notice at any time on or after march  each holder of the convertible notes has the right to cause us to repurchase all of such holder s convertible notes at of their principal amount plus accrued interest upon the occurrence of any fundamental change  which includes a transaction or event such as an exchange offer  liquidation  tender offer  consolidation  merger or combination 
fluctuations in our stock price impact the prices of our outstanding convertible securities and the likelihood of the convertible securities being converted into cash or equity 
if our stock price is below the conversion price of our convertible bonds on the date of maturity  they may not convert into equity and we may be required to redeem the convertible securities for cash 
in the event they do not convert to equity  we believe that our current cash position and expected future operating cash flows will be adequate to meet these obligations as they mature 
it is our policy to reinvest our earnings and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends to stockholders in the foreseeable future 
in order to remain competitive in the manufacture of semiconductors  we continue to make significant investments in new facilities and capital equipment 
we may seek additional equity or debt financing from time to time 
we believe that our existing liquid resources and funds generated from operations  combined with funds from such financing and our ability to borrow funds  will be adequate to meet our operating and capital requirements and obligations for the foreseeable future 
however  we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available on favorable terms 
moreover  any future equity or convertible debt financing will decrease the percentage of equity ownership of existing stockholders and may result in dilution  depending on the price at which the equity is sold or the debt is converted 
as of december   we had operating leases financing certain wafer fabrication equipment see note of the notes 
the debt related to these operating leases is not reflected on the balance sheet 
per the terms of the leases  we are required to maintain a minimum balance in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
we were in compliance with this requirement as of december  we guarantee residual values of equipment on these leases 
as of december   we do not expect to realize a loss on the guarantee at the end of the lease term  and accordingly  no additional rent expense has been recognized 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december  and the effect these obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
payments due by period contractual obligations less than year years years after years total in millions convertible subordinated notes  operating lease obligations capital lease obligations total  excludes the change in fair value of the interest rate risk on the convertible subordinated notes of million at december  see note of the notes 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
note of the notes describes the significant accounting policies essential to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures 
we believe the following to be critical accounting policies 
that is  they are both important to the portrayal of our company s financial condition and results  and they require significant management judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
as a result of the inherent uncertainty  there is a likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
although we believe that our judgments and estimates are appropriate and correct  actual future results may differ materially from our estimates 
inventory reserves 
we establish reserves for estimated excess or obsolete inventory based upon assumptions about demand and market conditions generally over the following months 
we operate in a volatile industry sector characterized by rapid changes in technology and market conditions 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
we operate our own wafer fabrication facilities and make significant capital expenditures to ensure that we are technologically competitive 
in addition  we have actively pursued the acquisition of businesses  which has resulted in significant goodwill and intangible assets 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets  identifiable intangibles and related goodwill annually or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors which could trigger an impairment review include the following i significant negative industry or economic trends  ii exiting an activity in conjunction with a restructuring of operations  iii current  historical or projected losses that demonstrate continuing losses associated with an asset  or iv a significant decline in our market capitalization  for an extended period of time  relative to net book value 
when we determine that there is an indicator that the carrying value of long lived assets  identifiable intangibles and related goodwill may not be recoverable  we measure impairment based on estimates of future cash flows 
these estimates include assumptions about future conditions such as future revenues  gross margins  operating expenses within our company  the fair values of certain assets based on appraisals  and industry trends 
valuation of residual value guarantees 
we guarantee the residual values of equipment associated with two of our operating leases 
see note of the notes 
if it becomes probable that a loss on the guarantees will occur  we would immediately recognize the deficiency as additional rent expense on a straight line basis over the remaining term of the lease 
in order to assess whether or not a loss has occurred  we use independent appraisals and use of management estimates to estimate the residual value of the equipment 
these estimates include assumptions about future conditions within our company and industry 
we test for potential loss annually or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the residual value of the equipment may be lower than the guaranteed residual value 
as of december   our maximum potential exposure to residual value guarantees is million 
restructuring reserves 
we have recorded reserves for restructuring costs related to the restructuring of operations 
the restructuring costs include payments to employees for severance  lease and contract termination fees  decommissioning costs for fabrication equipment  and other costs to close facilities 
the reserves are recorded at the time we announce a plan to exit certain activities and are based on estimates of the costs and length of time to exit those activities 
income taxes 
we have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
recent accounting pronouncements in august  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
the statement applies to all entities 
it applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and or the normal operation of a long lived asset  except for certain obligations of lessees 
this statement applies to certain contractual obligations we have under operating leases for facilities and equipment 
we adopted sfas no 
on january   and it did not have a significant effect on our consolidated balance sheet or statement of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for exit or disposal activities sfas no 

sfas no 
addresses significant issues regarding the recognition  measurement and reporting of costs that are associated with exit and disposal activities  including restructuring activities that are currently accounted for under eitf no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the scope of sfas no 
also includes costs related to terminating a contract that is not a capital lease and termination benefits that employees who are involuntarily terminated receive under the terms of a one time benefit arrangement that is not an ongoing benefit arrangement or an individual deferred compensation contract 
we are required to adopt the provisions of sfas no 
effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  the provisions of eitf no 
shall continue to apply for an exit activity initiated under an exit plan that met the criteria of eitf no 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
the adoption of sfas no 
will change on a prospective basis the timing of when restructuring charges are recorded from a commitment date approach to when the liability is incurred 
we do not anticipate that the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheet or statement of operations 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin requires that a liability be recorded in the guarantor s balance sheet upon issuance of a guarantee 
in addition  fin requires disclosures about the guarantees that an entity has issued  including a reconciliation of changes in the entity s product warranty liabilities 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of fin are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december   irrespective of the guarantor s fiscal year end 
the disclosure requirements of fin are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  we are in the process of evaluating the impact fin will have to us  but currently believe that only our consolidated balance sheet will be affected 
the guaranteed residual values for the equipment under two of our operating leases are subject to fin and will require us to gross up our balance sheet in  by creating an asset and equal liability for the fair value of the guaranteed residual value of the equipment 
we do not believe that this pronouncement will have a material net impact to our consolidated statement of operations 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our operating leases 
in november  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf issue no 
provides guidance on how to account for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services and or rights to use assets 
the provisions of eitf issue no 
will apply to revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  we believe that the adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheet or statement of operations 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
sfas no 
also requires that disclosures of the pro forma effect of using the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation be displayed more prominently and in a tabular format 
additionally  sfas no 
requires disclosure of the pro forma effect in interim financial statements 
the transition and annual disclosure requirements of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years ended after december  the interim disclosure requirements are effective for interim periods ending after december  we have adopted the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
as of december  in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin is effective immediately for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after january  for variable interest entities created or acquired prior to february   the provisions of fin must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after june  we currently have two operating leases for equipment  as discussed in note of the notes 
the assets currently held under these operating leases had an original cost of approximately million and are held in entities generally set up to own and lease such assets to the company 
based on our interpretation of fin  we currently believe that we will be required to consolidate the variable interest entities associated with these operating leases on july   the effective date of the statement for us  barring financial restructuring 
we are currently seeking to refinance these leases in a manner that best meets our capital financing strategy and our cost of capital objectives 
we believe that these leases once refinanced  would not require consolidation 
factors that may affect future operating results statements in this discussion and analysis include forward looking information within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities and exchange act of  as amended 
all forward looking statements included in this discussion and analysis are based on information available to us on the date of filing of this annual report on form k  and we assume no obligation to update any such forward looking statements 
these statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties 
our actual results in future periods may be significantly different from any future performance suggested in this report 
in some cases  you can identify forward looking statements by terminology such as may  will  expects  plans  anticipates  believes  estimates  intends  projects  predicts  or similar expressions 
for such statements  we claim the protection under the safe harbor for forward looking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act of although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward looking statements are reasonable  we cannot guarantee future results  levels of activity  performance or achievements 
risks and uncertainties that may affect our results may include  among others o the long term down turn of the economy and the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry and the markets addressed by our products  o availability and extent of utilization of manufacturing capacity  o use of foundries to outsource production of a substantial portion of our wafer requirements  o disruptions in general economic activity due to worsening global business conditions or caused by the effects of terrorist activities or armed conflict  o adverse changes in general economic conditions in any of the countries in which we do business  o dependence on a limited number of customers for a substantial portion of our revenues  o price erosion  o competitive factors  o timing and success of new product introductions  o changes in product mix  o fluctuations in manufacturing yields  o product obsolescence  o business and product market cycles  o economic and technological risks associated with our acquisitions  investments and alliance activities  and o the ability to develop and implement new technologies 
our operating results could also be impacted by sudden fluctuations in customer requirements  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and other economic conditions affecting customer demand and the cost of operations in one or more of the global markets in which we do business 
we operate in a technologically advanced  rapidly changing and highly competitive environment 
while we cannot predict what effect these various factors may have on our financial results  the aggregate effect of these and other factors could result in significant volatility in our future performance 
to the extent our performance may not meet expectations published by external sources  public reaction could result in a sudden and significantly adverse impact on the market price of our securities  particularly on a short term basis 
we have international subsidiaries and distributors that operate and sell our products globally 
further  we purchase a substantial portion of our raw materials and manufacturing equipment from foreign suppliers and incur labor and other operating costs in foreign currencies  particularly in our japanese manufacturing facilities 
as a result  we are exposed to the risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates or declining economic conditions in these countries 
we utilize forward exchange contracts and purchased currency option contracts to manage our exposure associated with net asset and liability positions and cash flows denominated in non functional currencies 
see note of the notes 
there is no assurance that these hedging transactions will eliminate exposure to currency rate fluctuations and this could affect our operating results 
our corporate headquarters and some of our manufacturing facilities are located near major earthquake faults 
as a result  in the event of a major earthquake  we could suffer damages that could significantly and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
we operate in an industry sector where the value of securities is highly volatile and may be influenced by economic and other factors beyond our control 
we believe that our future operating results will continue to be subject to quarterly variations based upon a wide variety of factors 
see additional discussion contained in risk factors set forth in part i  item of this annual report on form k  which is incorporated by reference into this part ii  item while management believes that the discussion and analysis in this report is adequate for a fair presentation of the information  we recommend that you read this discussion and analysis in conjunction with the remainder of this annual report on form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity 
we are subject to interest rate risk on our investment portfolio and outstanding debt 
in order to better manage interest rate risk on our investment portfolio see note of the notes  which reprices more frequently than the debt portfolio  and to better manage asset and liability mismatches  we entered into interest rate swap transactions the swaps with several investment banks in june the swaps effectively convert fixed interest payments on a portion of our billion convertible subordinated notes to libor based floating rates 
the swaps are accounted for as hedges 
see note of the notes 
the difference between the changes in the fair values of the derivative and the hedged risk resulted in a million charge that we included in interest expense on our statement of operations for the year ended december  an interest rate move of basis points of our weighted average worldwide interest rate in affecting our floating rate financial instruments as of december   including both debt obligations and investments  would not have a significant effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows over the next fiscal year  assuming that the investment balance remains consistent 
in  an interest rate move of basis points of our weighted average worldwide interest rate in affecting our interest sensitive investments would also not have had a significant effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
foreign currency exchange risk 
we have foreign subsidiaries that operate and sell our products in various global markets 
we purchase a substantial portion of our raw materials and equipment from foreign suppliers and incur labor and other operating costs in foreign currencies  particularly at our japanese manufacturing facilities 
as a result  our cash flow and earnings are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we attempt to limit these exposures through operational strategies and financial market instruments 
we use various hedge instruments  primarily forward contracts with maturities of six months or less and currency option contracts  to manage our exposure associated with net asset and liability positions and cash flows denominated in non functional currencies 
we did not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes during and based on our overall currency rate exposures at december   including derivative financial instruments and nonfunctional currency denominated receivables and payables  a near term appreciation or depreciation of the us dollar would not have a significant effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows over the next fiscal year 
in  a near term appreciation or depreciation of the us dollar would also not have had a significant effect 
equity price risk 
we have investments in marketable equity securities included in long term assets 
the fair values of these investments are sensitive to equity price changes 
any change in the value of marketable investments is ordinarily recorded through accumulated comprehensive income 
the increase or decrease in fair value of the investments would affect our results of operations to the extent the investments were sold or that declines in value were deemed by management to be other than temporary 
if prices of the equity investments increase or decrease from their fair value as of december   it would increase or decrease the investment values by million 
as of december   a increase or decrease in fair value would have increased or decreased the investment values by million 
we do not use any derivatives to hedge the fair value of our marketable equity securities
