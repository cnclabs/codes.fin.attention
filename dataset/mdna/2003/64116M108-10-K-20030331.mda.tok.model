we currently offer our products and services in thirteen locations around the world 
during  we discontinued operations in a number of international markets that were not viewed by us as critical markets 
in france  japan  and brazil  our products and services are sold through joint ventures 
as of december   we held a ownership interest in mediametrie eratings 
com  our french joint venture  and the remaining ownership interest was held by mediametrie

com  and the remaining ownership interest was held by ibope 
revenue from our joint ventures internet audience measurement services are allocated between netratings and the joint ventures depending on the location of the customer and the location of the panel whose data is used in the service 
we use the equity method to account for our joint ventures 
we generate revenues primarily from the sale of our internet audience measurement products and services 
our products and services include both syndicated products and customized products 
we primarily sell our syndicated products and services on an annual subscription basis and bill our clients in advance  typically on an annual or quarterly basis 
we recognize revenue from the sale of our syndicated products and services ratably over the term of the subscription agreement 
prepaid subscription fees are recorded as deferred revenue until earned 
revenue from customized products and services is recognized in the period in which the product or service is provided 
therefore a significant portion of revenue recognized in any period results from the amortization of deferred revenue balances 
we also derive a portion of our revenue from royalty payments from our joint venture partners 
we have a limited operating history upon which investors may evaluate our business prospects 
we have incurred net losses since our inception  and as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
we expect to continue to invest in enhancing our products and service offerings  including investment in our megapanel service 
as a result  we expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  our management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to bad debts  investments  income taxes  financing operations  contingencies  and litigation 
our management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the result of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  as amended by sab a and b 
sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria is based on management s judgment regarding the collectibility of those fees 
we primarily sell these products and services pursuant to one year subscription agreements and bill our customers in advance  typically on a quarterly or annual basis 
we recognize revenue from the sale of our information and analytical products and services ratably over the term of the subscription agreement 
prepaid subscription fees are recorded as deferred revenue until earned 
if a contract s collectibility comes into question  revenue recognition is discontinued until collectibility is reasonably assured 
this determination is based on our management s judgment and could adversely affect both revenue and deferred revenue 
bad debt we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make contractually required payments 
if the financial conditions of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required and such allowances are based on management s judgment 
legal contingencies we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings as discussed in note of our financial statements 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses  in accordance with fas a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies are made after careful analysis of each individual case 
we do not believe the outcomes to these matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial position 
nonetheless  it is possible that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategy related to these proceedings 
goodwill and intangible assets we recorded goodwill and intangible assets during in connection with our acquisitions 
those intangible assets not deemed to have an indefinite life are amortized over their estimated useful lives  which range from to years 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles are not amortized  but are reviewed at least annually for impairment 
we performed our annual evaluation of goodwill and intangibles as of december  and no impairment was indicated 
we will reassess the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets each year as of october  unless indicators of impairment become apparent earlier 
investments we hold minority interests in companies having operations or technology in areas within or adjacent to our strategic focus 
these entities are non publicly traded companies whose value is difficult to determine 
for those investments accounted for based on the cost method  we record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
for those investments accounted for based on the equity method  we reduce our investment in accordance with our equity in each joint venture s loss and record a corresponding loss on joint ventures in our statement of operations 
the equity basis is adjusted for any additional capital contributions or commitments 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments and such amounts that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future

we generate revenue primarily from the sale of our internet audience measurement products and services 
we typically sell these services pursuant to one year subscription agreements and bill our customers in advance  usually on an annual or quarterly basis 
we also derive a portion of our revenue from our joint venture partners 
revenue increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in revenue was primarily due to the acquisitions during the second and third quarters of these increases were partially offset by the decrease in the amortization of deferred revenue as a result of an overall decline in contract sales due to a deteriorating economy 
for the year ended december  our global internet audience measurement products and services increased to of our revenue as compared to for the year ended december   primarily due to the acquisitions during  our suite of custom and analytical services comprised of the revenue as compared to for the year ended december   and our international royalties decreased to of the revenue as compared to for the year ended december   primarily due to the acquisition of eratings during the year which eliminated royalties received from them 
as of december   approximately customers worldwide subscribed to our products and services 
our global contract renewal rate was for the fourth quarter of compared with a renewal rate for the fourth quarter of our global average sales price was  for the fourth quarter of compared with  for the fourth quarter of during the year ended december   no customer accounted for more than of our revenue 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses related to the recruitment  maintenance  and support of our internet audience measurement panels  which are expensed as they are incurred 
cost of revenue also includes data collection costs for our products and services and operational costs related to our data center 
accordingly  such expenses are not matched with any revenue or subscriptions generated in a given period and are higher in periods in which we are involved in significant panel development activities 
also included in cost of revenue are the data acquisition costs related to our joint ventures  which are recognized ratably over the term of the customer s subscription agreement  as the data is provided  as well as the royalty fees associated with certain data partnering agreements 
cost of revenue increased to million  or of revenue for the year ended december  from million  or of revenue for the year ended december  cost of revenue increased due to i the expansion of our data center primarily related to the acquisition of adrelevance  ii expenses related to the third party generated surveys related to the plan product  and iii the international panel expenses related to the acquisitions of eratings and netvalue 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in strategic partner royalty expenses related to the discontinuation of adspectrum and ecommercepulse and a reduction in panel fees associated with both the us home and at work panels as recruiting efforts decreased 
in february  we announced our intention to launch a megapanel service in the united states and to expand the service internationally  which will require significant investment in recruitment and panel related costs 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for personnel associated with our research and product development activities 
these costs are expensed as incurred 
research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable period in research and development expenses represented and of revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase was primarily due to increased research and development personnel and associated payroll expenses resulting from the acquisitions during the year  partially offset by our reduction in workforce in the first quarter of sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  benefits  and commissions to our salespeople and analysts  as well as costs related to seminars  promotional materials  public relations  advertising  and other sales and marketing programs 
sales and marketing expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable period in sales and marketing expenses represented and of revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease was primarily related to a reduction in advertising  public relations  travel  and entertainment expenses resulting from our efforts to reduce discretionary spending 
the decrease was partially offset by an increase in payroll and related expenses resulting from an increased headcount in general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for executive management  finance  accounting  human resources  legal  information technology  and other administrative personnel  in addition to professional fees and other general corporate expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable period in general and administrative expenses represented and of revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in absolute dollars was primarily related to higher payroll and related expenses due to a higher average headcount in in addition  higher travel and related expenses during further contributed to the overall increase in general and administrative expenses 
restructuring and other expenses 
during the first quarter of  we initiated a restructuring plan to streamline our business to focus on core products  refine our product line  and consolidate space at our milpitas  california facility 
this plan also included a reduction in workforce 
the restructuring expense of million recorded in the first quarter reflected the severance expenses related to the termination of employees  all of whom have been terminated  accruals related to costs to terminate or transition contracts due to the elimination of products  impairment charges related to fixtures and equipment  and an accrual for the lease payments related to office space in excess of our current and projected future needs 
during the fourth quarter of  we decreased by  our accruals related to the elimination of products due to the successful resolution of customer contract issues related to the eliminated products  and recorded additional charges related to legal matters  intangible assets  and severance benefits based on the identification of additional employees who were terminated prior to december  we expect these restructuring activities will result in annual operating expense savings of approximately  there were no corresponding expenses recorded during acquisition related expenses 
during the first quarter of  we recognized acquisition related expenses of million related to the terminated merger between netratings and jupiter media metrix 
there were no corresponding charges in amortization of intangibles 
during the year ended december   we recognized amortization of intangible assets of million resulting from the amortization of the specifically identified intangibles associated with the acquisitions of adrelevance  plan  eratings  and netvalue and other intangible assets  including patents 
there was no corresponding amortization in stock based compensation 
stock based compensation primarily represents amortization of deferred charges related to stock warrants which nielsen media research exercised in december stock based compensation expenses decreased to million  or of revenue for the year ended december  from million  or of revenue for the year ended december  the decrease primarily resulted from the scheduled amortization of our stock based compensation costs  partially offset by the expenses associated with the accelerated vesting for the former chairman of the board 
loss from joint ventures 
loss from joint ventures decreased to million  or of revenue for the year ended december  from million  or of revenue for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to our acquisition of acnielsen s interest in eratings in may  after which eratings losses have been reported in our consolidated results rather than in the loss from joint ventures 
the decrease in losses is also due to a reduction in the number of countries in which the nielsen netratings service is offered when compared to the corresponding period in impairment of investments 
management performs regular reviews to determine if investments are impaired 
during our fourth quarter review  we determined that two of our investments in equity securities were impaired due to changes in the companies business models and their deteriorating financial position 
since we concluded that these impairments were other than temporary  we recognized one time non cash charges of million 
there was no corresponding impairment of investments in and at december  we have written down our long term investments to zero 
interest income  net 
interest income  net  decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable period in the decrease reflects an overall reduction of interest rates in when compared with decrease in interest income also resulted from an overall reduction in cash and cash equivalents during as a result of the repurchase of shares of common stock from two former executives  acquisitions completed during the year and the settlement of the patent infringement litigation with jupiter media metrix 
we anticipate interest income to continue to decline as the current market conditions prevail 
minority interest 
at december  we owned approximately of the capital of netvalue 
the minority interest in the loss of netvalue was recorded to reflect the interest of the minority shareholders in the operations of netvalue 
there were no corresponding amounts in operating loss 
operating loss increased to million  or of revenue for the year ended december  from million  or of revenue for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to the higher production costs for our online products and services as the result of acquisitions  restructuring and other expenses  acquisition related expenses  and amortization of intangibles 
the increase in operating loss was partially offset by an increase in revenue  a reduction in sales and marketing expenses  and a reduction in amortization of stock based compensation during net loss 
for the year ended december   our net loss increased to million  or per share on approximately million shares outstanding  as compared with a net loss of million  or per share on approximately million shares outstanding for year ended december  the increase is primarily due to i a decrease in interest income resulting from acquisitions and the reduction in interest rates  ii impairment of investments  iii restructuring expenses  iv acquisition related expenses  v amortization of intangible assets  and vi an increase in cost of revenue expenses 
these increases were partially offset by i higher revenue in  ii a reduction in sales and marketing expenses  iii a reduction in joint venture losses as the result of the acquisition of eratings and iv the reduction in amortization of stock based compensation 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue 
revenue increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  sales of our information and analytical products and services accounted for substantially all of the revenue for each year 
the increase in revenue was primarily due to the amortization of deferred revenue from the contract sales in and from increased revenue related to the introduction of international audience measurement services during for the year ended december  our audience measurement service comprised of our revenue as compared to for the year ended december   our suite of analytical services comprised of the revenue as compared to for the year ended december   and our international royalties comprised of the revenue as compared to for the year ended december  during the year ended december   no customer accounted for more than of our revenue

the increase was offset by a decrease in expenses related to the canadian panel and us home and at work panels 
the decrease in percentage was primarily due to our higher revenues 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased to million  or of revenue for the year ended december  from million  or of revenue for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to higher engineering staff payroll and related expenses resulting from higher average engineering headcount in sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses decreased to million  or of revenue for the year ended december  from million  or of revenue for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily related to a reduction in advertising  public relations  travel and entertainment expenses resulting from our efforts to reduce discretionary spending 
the decrease was furthered by a reduction in commission expenses 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased to million  or of revenue for the year ended december  from million  or of revenue for the year ended december  this increase in absolute dollars was primarily related to higher payroll and related expenses due to a higher average headcount in in addition  higher legal expenses related to litigation further contributed to the overall increase in general and administrative expenses 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation expenses decreased to million  or of revenue for the year ended december  from million  or of revenue for the year ended december  the decrease primarily resulted from the scheduled amortization of our stock based compensation costs 
loss from joint ventures 
loss from joint ventures increased to million  or of revenue for the year ended december  from million  or of revenue for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to the offering of our nielsen netratings services by our joint venture partners in an additional countries compared to interest income  net 
interest income  net  decreased to million  or of revenue for the year ended december  from million  or of revenue for the year ended december  the decrease reflects an overall reduction of interest rates in when compared to as well as an increase in interest expense recorded related to the accrued eratings capital contribution

net loss 
for the year ended december   our net loss increased to million  or a loss of per share on approximately million shares outstanding  as compared to a net loss of million  or a loss of per share on approximately million shares outstanding for year ended december  the increase is primarily due to a decrease in interest income resulting from a reduction in interest rates  an increase in the accrued losses on our joint venture activity  and an increase in cost of revenue expenses  offset by the higher revenue recorded in  a reduction in overall operating expenses due to our efforts to reduce discretionary spending and the reduction in amortization of stock based compensation 
inflation our management currently believes that inflation has not had a material impact on continuing operations 
liquidity and capital resources at december   the company s cash and cash equivalents and short term investments were million compared with million at december  the primary use of cash during was to repurchase shares of common stock from two former executives  fund acquisitions and operations  and settle the patent infringement litigation 
cash used in operating activities was million in due to our net loss of million and cash used in working capital changes of million offset by non cash charges of million 
the non cash expenses include million for stock based compensation  million for depreciation  million for loss on joint ventures  million for amortization of intangible assets and million for impairment of investments 
cash used in operating activities was million in due to our net loss of million offset by net working capital changes of million  non cash expenses of million for stock based compensation  million for depreciation  million for loss on joint ventures  and provision for doubtful accounts of million 
cash provided by operating activities was million in our million net loss in was offset by our net working capital changes of million and non cash expenses of million for stock based compensation  million for depreciation  and million for loss on joint ventures and provision for doubtful accounts of million 
we expect net cash used in operating activities to increase during due to the launch of our megapanel service announced in february  and a continued decrease in interest income as a result of our lower cash and short term investments balances and the low interest rate environment 
net cash provided by investing activities during was million reflecting net sales of our short term investments of million 
the increase was partially offset by cash paid for acquisitions  net of cash acquired  cash investments in joint ventures and patent settlement and acquisition costs totaling million  and acquisition of property and equipment of million 
net cash provided by investing activities during was million due to net sales of our short term investments of million  partially offset by cash investments in joint ventures of million  and acquisition of property and equipment of million 
net cash used in investing activities totaled million in primarily related to the net purchase of million in short term investments  investments in joint ventures of million  and capital expenditures of million 
we had no material capital expenditure commitments at december  and anticipate that capital expenditure spending will approximate the level of spending 
we expect net cash provided by investing activities to be further reduced by use of our short term investments to support operations and investments in joint ventures and other potential strategic investments 
net cash used in financing activities totaled million for the year ended december  this was primarily related to million used to repurchase million shares of common stock from two former executive officers  offset by the exercise of options and stock issued through our employee stock purchase plan  totaling million 
net cash used in financing activities totaled  in this was primarily related to a million payment to settle outstanding litigation against us  which was partially offset by the exercise of options and the purchase of stock through the employee stock purchase plan  amounting to million 
net cash provided by financing activities totaled  in  primarily related to the exercise of options and the purchase of stock through the employee stock purchase plan  offset by payments on our capital lease obligations 
as of december   minimum payments under all non cancelable lease agreements were as follows in thousands year ending december and thereafter total minimum lease payments  in connection with business acquisitions and restructuring activities in  our restructuring liability account includes accruals for several facilities in which there is idle space or space in excess of projected needs 
rent payments related to these facilities are not included in the future minimum lease commitments 
in the ordinary course of business we enter into various arrangements with vendors and other business partners principally for panel development  panel maintenance  and marketing 
there are no material commitments for these arrangements extending beyond while we have historically made additional contributions to our joint ventures in order to maintain our ownership percentage  we are not contractually required to make such contributions 
in the event of a request for capital infusion  we have the option as to whether or not we participate in the round of funding 
should we elect not to participate our equity position would be diluted in that joint venture 
we believe that our existing balances of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months  although we could elect to seek additional funding prior to that time 
we could require additional capital prior to the end of this period if  for example  we were to experience greater than expected losses from operations  we were required to pay damages in connection with any litigation  or if we were to pursue one or more business acquisitions or investments 
if we do require additional financing  however  we cannot be certain that it will be available when required  on favorable terms  or at all 
if we are not successful in raising additional capital as required  our business could be harmed 
if additional funds were raised through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage ownership of our then current stockholders would be reduced 
risk factors that may affect our performance an investment in our company involves a high degree of risk 
you should carefully consider the risks below  together with the other information contained in this report  before you make an investment decision with respect to our company 
the risks described below are not the only ones facing our company 
additional risks not presently known to us or that we deem immaterial may also impair our business operations 
any of the following risks i could materially adversely affect our business  operating results  and financial condition  ii could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline  and iii could cause you to lose all or part of your investment 
we have incurred losses since inception and we may be unable to achieve profitability we have experienced operating losses in each quarter since our inception 
we incurred net losses of million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december   and as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
we intend to continue to make significant expenditures as our company grows and as we expand our portfolio of products and services 
as a result  we will need to generate significant revenue to achieve and maintain profitability 
we may not be able to achieve significant revenue growth in the future 
our operating results for future periods are subject to numerous uncertainties and we may not achieve sufficient revenue to become profitable 
we have a limited operating history in the evolving market for internet audience measurement we were incorporated in july and did not start generating revenue until the quarter ended june  we introduced our nielsen netratings internet audience measurement service in the quarter ended june  many of our other products and services were first offered by us during accordingly  we are still in the early stages of development and have only a limited operating history upon which to evaluate our business 
one should evaluate our likelihood of financial and operational success in light of the risks  uncertainties  expenses  delays  and difficulties associated with an early stage business in an evolving market  many of which may be beyond our control  including the risk that a competing company s internet audience measurement service will become the accepted standard for internet audience measurement  the extent of growth  if any  in the internet audience measurement market  our potential inability to successfully manage any significant growth we may achieve in the future  our potential inability to successfully integrate any acquired business  technology  or service  and the risks associated with our international operations  including the necessary investments in our international joint ventures 
our quarterly revenues may fluctuate significantly and because our expense levels are based in large part on our estimates of future revenues  an unexpected shortfall in revenue would significantly harm our operating results and could lead to reduced prices for our stock due to our limited operating history and the evolving nature of the market in which we compete  our future revenue is difficult to forecast 
further  our expense levels are based largely on our investment plans and estimates of future revenue 
we may be unable to adjust our spending to compensate for an unexpected shortfall in revenue 
accordingly  any significant shortfall in revenue relative to our planned expenditures in a particular quarter would harm our results of operations and could lead our stock price to fall sharply  particularly following quarters in which our operating results fail to meet expectations 
factors that may cause fluctuations in our revenues or operating results on a quarterly basis include the following  some of which are beyond our control the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures related to the expansion of our business  the amount and timing of costs related to changes in the size or composition of our at home and at work panels  particularly as a result of turnover among panel members  the impact on our renewal rates caused by the failure of any of our current customers  our customers budgetary constraints  or a perceived lack of need for our services  changes in demand for our products and services due to the announcement or introduction of new products and services or the cancellation of existing products and services by us or our competitors or a continued slowdown in online advertising spending  changes in the pricing of our products and services in light of the services and pricing offered by our competitors  the impact of possible acquisitions or equity investments both on our operations and on our reported operating results due to associated accounting charges  and technical difficulties or service interruptions that significantly harm our ability to deliver our products and services on schedule 
the current economic downturn has adversely affected our business general economic conditions  and conditions in the internet sector in particular  have caused some of our customers to cease operations and others to cancel their contracts or reduce their spending on the products and services that we supply 
in addition  our adrelevance business derives  and expects to continue to derive for the foreseeable future  a large portion of its revenue from the automated retrieval and delivery of online advertising data 
expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical  reflecting overall economic conditions as well as budgeting and buying patterns 
the overall market for advertising  including internet advertising  has been characterized in recent quarters by increasing softness of demand  lower prices for advertisements  the reduction or cancellation of advertising contracts  an increased risk of uncollectible receivables from advertisers  and the reduction of marketing and advertising budgets  especially by internet related companies 
as a result of these reductions  advertising spending across traditional media  as well as the internet  has decreased 
we have limited ability to forecast the rate at which subscriptions for our services may be renewed  and we may not achieve sufficiently high renewal rates to become profitable we derive substantially all of our revenue from annual subscriptions for our services 
as our business becomes more established  we expect subscription renewals and sales of additional products and services to existing customers to account for an increasing proportion of our revenue 
any unexpectedly low renewal rates or a reduction in the number of products and services that we are able to sell to existing customers would harm our operating results and could prevent us from becoming profitable 
to date  renewals have been an essential element of our revenue growth 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to achieve or sustain high renewal rates  particularly during an economic downturn 
additionally  because most internet related businesses are still in the early stages of development  consolidations in our customer base or the failure of a significant number of our customers businesses could cause a decline in renewal rates for our products and services 
we may be unable to obtain complete ownership of netvalue  sa  which could result in increased operating expenses relating to the operation of a public company subsidiary in france on august   we acquired a controlling interest in netvalue  sa  a publicly traded french company listed on the nouveau march of euronext paris sa following the purchase of the controlling interest in netvalue and the purchase of additional shares of netvalue on the open market  we completed a simplified all cash take over bid which resulted in the purchase of an additional  shares of netvalue 
as a result  we currently own  shares of netvalue representing approximately of the capital and of the voting rights of netvalue 
in france  a simple majority ownership position is not  however  sufficient to ensure the complete acquisition of a company  as may occur in the united states through the use of a merger structure 
french law provides a mechanism for obtaining complete control of a company but only if we acquire or greater of netvalue s outstanding stock 
should we not be able to reach the ownership threshold in netvalue  or if the complete acquisition of netvalue were delayed  netvalue would continue to operate as a separate entity in france 
continued operation of a public company subsidiary in france would result in increased operating expenses  including legal  accounting  and other administrative expenses 
the acceptance and effectiveness of internet advertising and electronic commerce is uncertain  and if these markets fail to develop or develop more slowly than we expect  our business will suffer our future success will depend in part on an increase in the use of the internet as an advertising medium  the proliferation of e commerce  and the use of the internet as part of multi channel marketing strategies 
these markets and marketing techniques are new and rapidly evolving  and the long term effectiveness of internet advertising is uncertain 
more recently  in the face of a slowing economy overall  there has been increased uncertainty about the demand and market acceptance for internet advertising and e commerce 
the adoption of internet advertising  particularly by entities that have historically relied on traditional media for advertising  requires the acceptance of a new way of conducting business 
these companies may find internet advertising to be less effective than traditional advertising for promoting their products and services 
they may also be unwilling to pay premium rates for advertising that is targeted at specific types of users based on demographic profiles or recent internet behavior 
the internet advertising and e commerce markets may also be adversely affected by privacy issues surrounding the targeting of this type of advertising or the use of personal information 
providers of goods and services online continue to work toward the establishment of commerce models that are cost effective and unique  and effectively deal with issues such as channel conflict and infrastructure costs 
growth in the use of the internet for e commerce may not continue  or the internet may not be adopted as a medium of commerce by a broad base of customers 
in addition  many current and potential publishers of content and commerce merchants on the internet have little or no experience in generating revenue from the sale of advertising space on their internet sites or from conducting online commerce transactions 
because of the foregoing factors  among others  the market for internet advertising and e commerce may not continue to emerge or become sustainable 
if these markets fail to develop or develop more slowly than we expect  our business will suffer 
the market for internet audience measurement and analysis is highly competitive  and if we cannot compete effectively  our revenues will decline the market for internet audience measurement and analysis is new  rapidly evolving and highly competitive 
we compete with a number of companies in the market for internet audience measurement services and analytical services  and we expect competition in this market to intensify in the future 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in our market are the ability to provide high quality  accurate and reliable data regarding internet audience behavior and activity in a timely manner  the breadth and depth of the product and services offered and their flexibility and ease of use  the availability of data across various geographic areas  the ability to offer high quality analytical services based on the internet audience measurement information  the ability to offer products and services that meet the changing needs of our customers  and the prices that are charged for the products and services  as well as the general economic conditions 
some of our competitors may be able to devote greater resources to marketing and promotional campaigns  adopt more aggressive pricing policies  or devote more resources to technology and systems development 
in light of these factors  we may be unable to compete successfully in our market 
any acquisitions or equity investments that we undertake could be difficult to close and integrate  may disrupt our business  dilute stockholder value  or harm our operating results we may continue to acquire or make investments in complementary businesses  technologies  services  or products if appropriate opportunities arise 
negotiating such acquisitions can be difficult  time consuming  and expensive and our ability to close such transactions may often be subject to approvals  such as governmental regulation  which are beyond our control 
consequently  we can make no assurances that such acquisitions  once undertaken and announced  will close 
further  the process of integrating any acquired business  technology  service or product into our business and operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures 
integration of an acquired company also may consume much of our management s time and attention that would otherwise be available for ongoing development of our business 
moreover  the anticipated benefits of any acquisition may not be realized 
companies in which we invest may not be successful in executing their business strategies and we may be required to write off all or part of our investment 
we may be unable to identify  negotiate or finance future acquisitions or investments successfully  or to integrate successfully any acquisitions with our current business 
future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt  contingent liabilities  or amortization expenses related to intangible assets  any of which could harm our business 
we are dependent on nielsen media research for the development and maintenance of panels of internet users in the united states and on acnielsen and our other joint venture partners for the development and maintenance of such panels in international markets the data for our audience measurement service is collected from randomly selected groups of internet users that are generally referred to as audience measurement panels 
our at home internet audience measurement panel in the united states has been developed and is maintained by nielsen media research as part of our strategic relationship with that company 
similarly  our internet audience measurement panels and other sampling methodologies that we employ in geographic locations outside of the united states  canada  france  and japan have been developed and maintained by eratings using acnielsen s proprietary sampling methodology and employees made available to eratings by acnielsen 
as part of the acquisition of eratings by netratings in may  acnielsen granted netratings a license to use acnielsen s sampling methodology and the nielsen name outside north america in the internet audience measurement business  and has entered into a service agreement to provide eratings  for a period of five years following the acquisition with the services of certain dedicated marketing and panel management personnel who are employed by acnielsen  as well as certain back office services which were provided to eratings by acnielsen prior to the acquisition 
accordingly  for a significant period of time  we expect that our business will be substantially dependent upon these arrangements for the continued maintenance of our international internet audience measurement panels and for other international business operations 
any failure on the part of nielsen media research  acnielsen  or our other joint venture partners to devote adequate resources to the development or maintenance of such panels or other sampling methodologies  or to maintain the overall quality of these methodologies  will harm our business 
in addition  nielsen media research may terminate its obligations with respect to internet audience measurement panels in the event it no longer holds at least of our outstanding stock on a fully diluted basis 
vnu nv  through its wholly owned subsidiaries nielsen media research and acnielsen  controls a majority of our outstanding stock and its representatives constitute a majority of our board of directors vnu  nv  through its wholly owned subsidiaries nielsen media research and acnielsen  has a majority stock ownership position in netratings  which enables it to control the direction and policies of netratings  including the election of our board of directors  amendment of our certificate of incorporation  and decisions regarding mergers  acquisitions  consolidations  and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets 
this control may have the effect of discouraging certain types of transactions involving a change of control 
in addition  vnu can control or influence the terms of our important commercial transactions  including our strategic relationships with nielsen media research and acnielsen 
vnu s representatives on our board are expected to recuse themselves from deliberations in which they have a conflict of interest 
however  these directors may take actions that favor vnu s interests over the interests of other stockholders  as a result  for instance  of conflicts of interest that are not apparent at the time of such actions 
our brand is dependent on the reputations of third parties over which we have no control the strength of the nielsen netratings brand is also closely dependent on the reputations of nielsen media research  acnielsen  and our other joint venture partners and the strength of their brands 
therefore  any negative publicity generated by nielsen media research  acnielsen  or our other joint venture partners  whether or not directly related to any nielsen netratings branded products or services  as well as any erosion of the strength of any of their brands  will adversely affect our own brand identity 
our costs to develop and maintain accurate internet audience measurement panels are significant and may increase we believe that the quality  size  and scope of our panels is critical to the success of our business 
to date  the expense of recruiting and operating our audience measurement panels has made up a very significant portion of the cost of revenue reported on our financial statements and  therefore  any increase in this expense will likely result in a decrease in our gross margin 
the costs associated with maintaining the quality  size  and scope are dependent on many factors some of which are beyond our control  including the cooperation rate of potential panel members and turnover among existing panel members  and accordingly we cannot necessarily control these costs to match increases or decreases in revenue 
to the extent that such additional expenses are not accompanied by increased revenue  our results of operations will be harmed 
we have limited experience in developing internet audience measurement panels  and we could experience lower cooperation rates or higher turnover rates in the future 
in february  we announced our intention to launch a megapanel service in the united states and to expand the service internationally  which will require significant investment 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in selling our megapanel service in the united states or internationally 
our international operations pose unique risks that may divert our management s attention and resources through our acquisition of i eratings  ii selected international assets of jupiter media metrix  and iii majority control of netvalue  we have acquired control of audience measurement data operations in countries that we have previously served only through our minority interest in eratings 
our international markets will require significant management attention and resources 
in addition  there can be no assurance of the continued growth of internet usage in international markets 
the international markets for audience measurement services have historically been localized and difficult to penetrate 
the success of the our international operations will depend on our ability to effectively select the appropriate countries to serve  recruit and maintain at home and at work panels that are representative of a geographic area  control costs and effectively manage foreign operations  manage third party vendors who will likely perform panel operations  and effectively develop  market  and sell new products and services in new  unfamiliar markets 
meeting these challenges may be difficult given the circumstances we face at the present time 
the operations of eratings that we have acquired are not supported by an existing independent eratings infrastructure 
historically  most of the back office services and employees and facilities required by eratings have been made available to it by acnielsen under various intercompany service agreements and arrangements 
although acnielsen no longer owns a direct equity interest in eratings  acnielsen has agreed to grant netratings a license to use acnielsen s proprietary audience sampling methodology and the nielsen trademark outside of north america in the internet audience measurement business  and has entered into a services agreement to provide eratings  for a period of five years beginning in may  with the services of certain dedicated marketing and panel management personnel who are employed by acnielsen  as well as certain back office services currently provided to eratings by acnielsen 
accordingly  for a significant period of time we expect that the eratings business will be substantially dependent upon these arrangements with acnielsen for its infrastructure  for the continued maintenance of its internet audience measurement panels and otherwise for the operation of its business 
although acnielsen may agree to extend the five year term of the arrangements  there can be no assurance that it would choose to do so 
even if we are successful in managing our international operations  we will be subject to a number of risks inherent in engaging in international operations  including changes in regulatory requirements  deficiencies in the telecommunications infrastructure in some countries  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  more rigorous levels of privacy protection in some countries  potentially adverse tax consequences  economic and political instability  and fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
we may not be successful in the development or introduction of new products and services to keep up with the proliferation of alternative internet access devices and technologies related to the expected convergence of the internet and television we believe that an increasing proportion of internet use will involve alternative internet access devices such as web enabled phones  television set top boxes and internet enabled gaming consoles and that there will eventually be a convergence of internet content and television programming 
accordingly  in order to continue to provide information about audience behavior throughout all major segments of the internet  we will be required to develop new products and services that address these evolving technologies 
we may be unsuccessful in identifying new product and service opportunities or in developing or marketing new products and services in a timely or cost effective manner 
in addition  product innovations may not achieve the market penetration or price stability necessary for profitability 
finally  we may not be successful in adapting our data collection software to evolving types of internet access devices or content 
if we are unable to provide audience measurement information regarding any significant segments of internet use  demand for our products and services may suffer 
we may not be able to recruit or retain qualified personnel our future success depends in large part on our ability to attract  retain  and motivate highly skilled employees 
we may have difficulties in retaining employees because many of our employees hold options to purchase our stock at prices significantly above the current market price for our stock 
although we provide compensation packages that include competitive salaries  stock options  bonus incentives  and other employee benefits  we may be unable to retain our key employees or to attract  assimilate and retain other highly qualified employees in the future  which would harm our business 
because the internet audience measurement industry is in its infancy  the pricing and acceptance of our products and services is uncertain we may be forced for competitive or technical reasons to reduce prices for some of our products or services or to offer them free of charge 
such circumstances would reduce our revenue and could harm our business 
additionally  our market is still evolving  and we have little basis to assess demand for different types of products or services or to evaluate whether our products and services will be accepted by the market 
if our products and services do not gain broad market acceptance  our business may fail 
the audience measurement services offered by nielsen media research or acnielsen may eventually have features that overlap with features of our internet audience measurement services as a result of convergence of television and the internet nielsen media research s principal business consists of providing television audience measurement services based on audience panels that it develops independent of its strategic relationship with us 
acnielsen also derives a substantial portion of its revenue from television audience measurement services outside of the united states 
if television and the internet converge in the future as expected  any internet audience information that is reported by television audience measurement services through these vnu subsidiaries may overlap with the audience information that is reported by the nielsen netratings internet audience measurement services 
in the event of such overlap  vnu s services could begin competing with our services for the same research budgets among customers in the marketplace  and its offering of such services could conflict with its obligation to develop and maintain our internet audience panels 
our business may be harmed if we supply inaccurate information to our customers if we furnish inaccurate information to our customers  our brand may be harmed 
the information in our databases  like that in any database  may contain inaccuracies that our customers may not accept 
any dissatisfaction by our customers with our measurement methodologies or databases could have an adverse effect on our ability to attract new customers and retain existing customers and could ultimately harm our brand 
our customer contracts generally provide that each customer must indemnify us for any damages arising from the use of data  reports or analyses by the customer or the performance of any consulting  analytic  or other services by us 
however  we cannot be certain that our contract provisions provide sufficient protection and  in any event  enforcing these protections could be very costly 
any liability that we incur or any harm to our brand that we suffer because of irregularities or inaccuracies in the data we supply to our customers could harm our business 
system failures or delays may harm our business  and our facilities and internal computer operations are vulnerable to natural disasters and other unexpected losses our success depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer and communications systems 
a failure of our network or our data gathering procedures could impede the processing of data  customer orders  and day to day management of our business and could result in the corruption or loss of data 
our internal computer operations are located in leased facilities in san jose  california  in an area that is susceptible to earthquakes 
we do not have a backup facility to provide redundant network capacity in the event of a system failure 
accordingly  if this location experienced a system failure  our online services would become unavailable to our customers until we were able to bring an alternative facility online  a process which could take several weeks 
these systems are also vulnerable to damage from fire  floods  power loss  telecommunications failures  break ins  and similar events 
we intend to develop back up systems outside of san jose 
however  as we replicate our systems at other locations  we will face a number of technical challenges  particularly with respect to database replications  which we may not be able to address successfully 
although we carry property and business interruption insurance  our coverage may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur 
our servers may also be vulnerable to computer viruses  physical or electronic break ins and similar disruptions 
during  the western united states and california in particular experienced repeated episodes of diminished electrical power supply 
as a result of these episodes  certain of our operations or facilities were subject to rolling blackouts or other unscheduled interruptions of electrical power 
the prospect of such unscheduled interruptions may continue for the foreseeable future and we are unable to predict either their occurrence  duration or cessation 
in addition  due to these power supply shortages  we may be subject to significantly greater power costs which may adversely affect our financial results 
a delay or discontinuation of our server hosting service could harm our business the servers on which we collect panel members data are maintained by abovenet at its facilities located in san jose  california 
we continually monitor our current utilization rate and the extent of our system capacity needs 
we believe we are currently operating at utilization levels that do not require additional capacity 
accordingly  our ability to collect internet audience data in real time is dependent upon the efficient and uninterrupted operation of abovenet s computer and communications hardware and software systems 
despite any precautions we may take  the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unanticipated problems at abovenet s facility could result in interruptions in the flow of data to our servers 
in addition  any failure by abovenet to provide our required data communications capacity could result in interruptions in our service 
in the past  we have experienced occasional minor interruptions in service from abovenet  although we have never experienced a significant interruption in service due to failures at abovenet 
in the event of a delay in the delivery of data from abovenet  or if abovenet should discontinue its services to us  we would be required to transfer our data collection operations to an alternative provider of server hosting services 
such a transfer could result in significant delays in our ability to deliver our products and services to our customers  which could damage our reputation and harm our business 
in recent quarters we have noticed a softening in the marketplace for co location services such as those offered by abovenet and its competitors and a corresponding decrease in the financial stability of many companies offering such services 
if this trend continues  we could face potential interruptions or cancellation of our services and could have difficulties in establishing similar services with alternative providers 
we are subject to pending legal proceedings we are currently subject to a securities class action complaint relating to our initial public offering 
the plaintiffs allege that our prospectus was materially false and misleading because it failed to disclose that the underwriters required several investors who sought large allocations of stock in the offering to pay excessive underwriters compensation in the form of increased brokerage commissions on other trades and required investors to agree to buy shares of our stock after the offering was completed at predetermined prices as a precondition to obtaining allocations in the offering 
the plaintiffs further allege that because of these purchases  our stock price after its initial public offering was artificially inflated 
similar complaints have been filed against a number of other issuers that had initial public offerings in and an adverse outcome could materially affect our results of operations and financial position 
we may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights we regard our intellectual property as critical to our success 
we rely on patent  trademark  copyright  and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary rights  and we seek to obtain the issuances of patents for our core technology and the registration of our material trademarks and service marks in the united states and in selected other countries 
we cannot assure you  however  that the steps we have taken will be sufficient to protect our intellectual property from infringement or misappropriation 
moreover  effective intellectual property protections may not be available in every country in which we offer our products and services to the extent these protections are available in the united states 
our patent applications or trademark registrations may not be approved or  even if approved  could be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation 
if our patent applications or trademark registrations are not approved because third parties own rights to the technology we are trying to patent or the trademarks we are trying to register  our use of such technology or trademark would be restricted unless we enter into arrangements with the third party owners  which might not be possible on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
on march   we filed a patent infringement lawsuit against the npd group alleging that npd is using methods for computer use tracking that infringes one of our patents for computer use tracking united states patent no 

we may face intellectual property infringement claims that would be costly to resolve or may require us to make changes to our technology or business third parties may  from time to time  assert claims that we have infringed upon their proprietary rights or claims that our own trademarks  patents  or other intellectual property rights are invalid 
such claims could adversely affect our reputation and the value of our own proprietary rights 
from time to time we have been  and we may in the future be  subject to such claims in the ordinary course of our business  including claims of alleged infringement of patents  trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third parties 
protection of proprietary rights in internet related industries is inherently uncertain due to the rapidly evolving technological environment 
as such  there may be numerous patent applications pending  many of which are confidential when filed  that provide for technologies similar to ours 
any claims of infringement and any resulting litigation  should they occur  could subject us to significant liability for damages  restrict us from using our technology or from operating our business generally  or require us to make changes to our technology 
any claims of this type  with or without merit  could be time consuming to defend  result in costly litigation  and divert management attention and resources 
in addition  such claims could result in limitations on our ability to use the intellectual property subject to these claims unless we are able to enter into royalty  licensing or other similar arrangements with the third parties asserting these claims 
such agreements  if required  may be unavailable on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if we are unable to enter into these types of agreements  we may be required to either cease offering the subject product or change our technology underlying the applicable product 
if a successful claim of infringement is brought against us and we fail to develop non infringing technology or to license the infringed or similar technology on a timely basis  it could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
any misappropriation of personal information about our panelists that is stored on our computers could harm our reputation or expose us to claims arising from damages suffered by those panelists personal information regarding our panelists is included in the data that our software captures from a panelist s internet use 
our panel data are released only in an aggregated format or in a form that is not identifiable on an individual basis 
however  if a person were to penetrate our network security or otherwise misappropriate sensitive data about our panel members  our reputation could be harmed or we could be subject to claims or litigation arising from damages suffered by panel members as a result of such misappropriation 
privacy concerns could lead to legislative  regulatory  and other limitations that could affect our ability to collect and use information about internet users  impair our ability to provide our products and services to clients and expose us to liability privacy concerns could lead to legislative  judicial  and regulatory limitations on our ability to collect  maintain and use information about internet users 
restrictions could be placed upon the collection  management  aggregation  and use of information  which could require significant reengineering time and resources 
we could be prohibited from collecting or disseminating certain types of information  which could in turn materially adversely affect our ability to provide our products and services to our clients 
failure to comply with the law and regulatory requirements may result in  among other things  administrative enforcement actions and fines  class action lawsuits  and civil and criminal liability 
the occurrence of one or more of these events could materially harm our business  results of operation  and financial condition 
governmental regulation of the internet might harm our business the applicability to the internet of existing laws governing issues such as property ownership  libel  and personal privacy is uncertain 
in addition  governmental authorities in various countries may seek to further regulate the internet with respect to issues such as user privacy  pornography  acceptable content  advertising  e commerce  taxation  and the pricing  characteristics and quality of products and services 
therefore  any new legislation regulating the internet could inhibit the growth of the internet and decrease the acceptance of the internet as a communications and commercial medium  which might harm our business 
finally  the global nature of the internet could subject us to the laws of a foreign jurisdiction in an unpredictable manner 
legislative actions  higher insurance costs  and potential new accounting pronouncements are likely to cause our general and administrative expenses to increase and impact our future financial position and results of operations in order to comply with the newly adopted sarbanes oxley act of  as well as changes to nasdaq listing standards and rules adopted by the securities and exchange commission  we may be required to increase our internal controls  hire additional personnel and additional outside legal  accounting and advisory services  all of which will cause our general and administrative costs to increase 
insurers are also likely to increase premiums as a result of the high claims rates incurred over the past year  and so our premiums for our various insurance policies  including our directors and officers insurance policies  are likely to increase 
changes in the accounting rules  including legislative and other proposals to account for employee stock options as a compensation expense among others  could materially increase the expenses that we report under generally accepted accounting principles and adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  any such changes may impact the amount of stock options we grant to our employees  which may affect our ability to recruit or retain key employees 
a sale by vnu of its stake in netratings could adversely affect our stock price there are no contractual restrictions on the ability of vnu  through its nielsen media research or acnielsen subsidiaries  to sell shares of our common stock  although sales in the public market will be subject to the volume limitations of sec rule pursuant to these volume limitations  a controlling stockholder may sell shares under rule only if the shares to be sold  together with the shares sold during the past three months  do not exceed the greater of of the issuer s outstanding shares or the average weekly trading volume of the issuer s shares during the preceding four calendar weeks 
nielsen media research  acnielsen  and several of our other stockholders have the right  under certain circumstances  to require us to register their stock for sale to the public  with the exception of the shares issued to acnielsen in the acquisition of eratings 
should vnu decide to sell its stake in netratings  it could adversely affect our stock price 
additionally  vnu will have the ability to transfer control of netratings  possibly at a premium over the then current market price 
because vnu will have the ability to effect such a transfer of control unilaterally  other stockholders could be denied an opportunity to participate in the transaction and receive a premium for their shares 
delaware law and our charter documents contain provisions that could discourage or prevent a potential takeover of our company that might otherwise result in our stockholders receiving a premium over the market price of their shares provisions of delaware law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make more difficult the acquisition of us by means of a tender offer  a proxy contest  or otherwise  and the removal of incumbent officers and directors 
these provisions include section of the delaware general corporation law  which prohibits a merger with a or greater stockholder  such as a party that has completed a successful tender offer  until three years after that party became a or greater stockholder  the authorization in the certificate of incorporation of undesignated preferred stock  which could be issued without stockholder approval in a manner designed to prevent or discourage a takeover  and provisions in our bylaws eliminating stockholders rights to call a special meeting of stockholders and requiring advance notice of any stockholder nominations of director candidates or any stockholder proposal to be presented at an annual meeting  which could make it more difficult for stockholders to wage a proxy contest for control of our board or to vote to repeal any of the anti takeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of million consisting of cash and highly liquid  short term investments 
declines of interest rates over time will reduce our interest income from our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments and  accordingly  could adversely affect our net income and earnings per share 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve capital while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of government and corporate obligations and money market funds 
as of december   our investments had a weighted average time to maturity of approximately days 
the following table presents the amounts of our financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk by expected maturity and average interest rates as of december  time to maturity one year or less one to two years in thousands  except percent data unaudited cash and cash equivalents  average interest rates short term investments   average interest rates netratings writes down its equity investments based on its share of the net losses recorded by its joint ventures 
the net losses of those entities are impacted by foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
a significant fluctuation in foreign exchange rates could materially impact the losses recorded for the international operations and joint ventures
