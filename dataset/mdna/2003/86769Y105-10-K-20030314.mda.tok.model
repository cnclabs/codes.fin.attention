industry background high speed data access data traffic in the united states and canada has surpassed the amount of voice traffic carried on the existing telephone network 
consumers are seeking higher speed access to bandwidth intensive content and services  such as highly graphical web sites  audio  video  and software downloads 
as an increasing number of internet users access more and different content  the ability to connect to and receive data from the internet at high speeds has become and will continue to become more important 
one primary investment area is the redesign of the access network to support broadband access to end users 
this portion of the network between the customer s premise and the service provider s central office is also known as the last mile 
the last mile typically consists of copper wires that operate at substantially lower transmission speeds than those offered in the long haul segment of a network or by some available broadband alternatives 
these copper wires were originally intended to carry only analog circuit switched  low speed voice signals and  as a result  have become a 
table of contents bottleneck that limits high speed data transmission 
several access technologies are being deployed to support higher speed internet access in the networks  including digital subscriber lines  digital cable tv modem  fiber optics  and broadband wireless 
in addition  the signaling portion of the network is essential to the integration of new broadband services into the existing telecommunications network 
we summarize some of these technologies below 
wire line access technology 
wire line access technology  including dsl technology  transmits data up to times faster than a conventional dial up modem using existing copper telephone wires 
the early adoption of high speed transmission included technologies such as t carrier  e carrier  isdn  and most recently dsl 
digital subscriber line technology  commonly known as dsl  today transmits data up to times faster than a conventional dial up modem using the existing copper telephone wires 
various implementations of dsl are being developed and deployed  including asymmetric dsl  known as adsl  symmetric dsl  know as sdsl  high bit rate dsl  known as hdsl  and integrated services digital network dsl  known as idsl 
service providers deploying dsl technology include incumbent local exchange carriers  such as sbc communications  inc  verizon communications  inc  and sprint corporation 
cable tv networks 
cable tv operators use two way cable  cable modems installed in the home  cable modem termination systems installed at major cable concentration points  and network headend equipment designed to interface their cable tv networks to video feeds and other networks 
several cable companies are currently offering broadband access services across two way cable  including comcast  charter communications  cox  and timewarner cable 
fiber optics 
fiber optic cables use pulses of light to transmit digital information 
because fiber optic cables support thousands of high speed  local digital connections onto a single higher speed connection to the central office or the central side of the cable tv network where the video signals emanate  they offer virtually unlimited bandwidth capacity 
due to their high capacity  fiber optic cables are being used increasingly in the access network in both telecommunications and cable tv applications 
signaling 
telephone systems require a signaling mechanism to set up and end phone calls 
these signals serve functions such as supervising or monitoring the status of a line on circuit to see if it is busy  idle  or requesting service  alerting or indicating the arrival of an incoming call  and addressing or transmitting routing and destination signals over the network 
signaling systems  or ss  is the standard signaling system used by telecom networks worldwide 
signaling networks must support new access technologies to ensure interoperability with the existing telephone network 
the need for service verification equipment in order to successfully deploy and maintain broadband networks  service providers rely on sophisticated service verification equipment 
this equipment allows service providers to pre qualify facilities for services  verify proper operation of newly installed services  and diagnose problems 
in addition  equipment manufacturers use service verification equipment to test simulated networks during equipment development and verify the successful production of equipment 
service verification equipment can be grouped into the following three types field verification  remote testing  and alarm and surveillance 
field verification equipment 
field verification equipment is used by service providers to probe the actual wires  cables  or airwaves to verify that a service works 
in the case of a service malfunction  a field technician can use the equipment to locate the exact fault so that repairs can be made 
research and development labs  manufacturing departments  and central office technicians also use field verification equipment in their day to day operations 
of the three types of service verification equipment  field verification equipment delivers the most detailed service information 
service providers have found field verification to be an effective method to ensure that the lines operate properly 

table of contents remote test equipment 
remote test equipment can help verify services and identify certain types of service malfunctions from a centralized location 
the equipment is typically controlled by a centralized test system that automates much of the remote testing process 
it is commonly used to determine which section within a  mile circuit has malfunctioned and to diagnose quickly the nature of a customer s complaint 
due to its centralized and automated nature  remote test equipment is an efficient way to complement field test equipment in the deployment and maintenance of broadband networks 
alarm and surveillance equipment 
alarm and surveillance equipment constantly monitors the telephone network  searching for facility or service degradations  including outages 
when a problem is noticed  a report may be sent immediately to an automated trouble diagnostic system or to a human operator who interprets the message and decides what further action is required 
corrective action typically involves field verification or remote test equipment to identify and correct specific problems 
because the competition for subscribers for high speed bandwidth access is intense  the quality and reliability of network service has become critical to service providers because of the expense  loss of customers  and negative publicity resulting from poor service 
field technicians who use service verification equipment allow service providers to verify and repair service problems effectively and  thus  increase the quality and reliability of the network 
the sunrise solution we design and manufacture service verification equipment that enables service providers to pre qualify facilities for services  verify newly installed services  and diagnose problems relating to wire line access services  including dsl services  fiber optic  cable tv  and signaling networks 
our products also enable equipment manufacturers to test simulated networks during equipment development and verify the successful production of equipment

the percentage of our total revenue contributed by each class of products were as follows year ended december  wire line access cable tv fiber optics signaling customers our customers include telecommunications service providers  cable network operators  network infrastructure suppliers and installers  technicians and engineers in north america  latin america  europe  africa  the middle east  and the asia pacific region 
the following is a selected list of our customers in at t corporation aol time warner  inc bell canada enterprises  inc bellsouth telecom  inc centurytel supply group  inc charter communications  inc comcast cable cox communications  inc csc holdings  inc dotcom telecommunications sdn reliance infocomm ltd sbc communications inc consisting of ameritech corporation  nevada bell  pacific bell  southern new england telephone  advanced solutions  inc  and southwestern bell telephone company solectron synchronous communications telkom sa  ltd verizon communications  inc as of december   we had sold versions of our products to over  customers in over countries 
no individual customer accounted for or more of our net sales in and affiliates of sbc communications accounted for approximately of our net sales in  in  and in during  of our net sales were to lucent technologies  either directly or indirectly through the contract manufacturer solectron 
besides sbc communications and lucent technologies solectron  no individual customer accounted for or more of our net sales in we expect  however  that we will continue to depend upon a relatively limited number of customers for substantially all of our revenues in future periods 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk factors affecting future operating results customer concentration 

table of contents sales  marketing and customer service sales 
we sell our products to telecommunications service providers  cable network operators  network infrastructure suppliers and installers  technicians  and engineers through manufacturers representatives  independent distributor organizations  and our direct sales force 
in the united states  we sell our products through manufacturers representatives who are supported by our in house direct sales force 
manufacturers representatives are paid on a commission basis and have exclusive rights in their respective regions 
our manufacturers representatives or direct salesmen solicit orders from the customer  and we ship our products directly to the customer 
we pay commissions once we have received payment from the customer 
our direct sales force includes a team of regional sales managers who direct the efforts of our manufacturers representatives and regional account managers who focus on specific accounts within a region 
outside the united states  we sell our products through independent distributor organizations  which are directed by our regional directors of marketing and sales 
we sell our products to the distributor at a discount from the end user price  and the distributor then resells the products to the end user 
international sales  including north american sales to canada  were million or in  million or in  and million or in we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our net sales in future periods 
in addition to our network of international distributors  we have sales employees based in anjou  canada  beijing  china  tokyo  japan  seoul  korea  modena  italy  and geneva  switzerland 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk factors affecting future operating results risks of international operations 
we sell our products predominantly to large telecommunications and cable service providers 
these types of customers generally commit significant resources to an evaluation of our and our competitors products and require each vendor to expend substantial time  effort  and money educating them about the value of the vendor s solutions 
consequently  sales to this type of customer generally require an extensive sales effort throughout the prospective customer s organization and final approval by an executive officer or other senior level employee 
the result is lengthy sales and implementation cycles  which make sales forecasting difficult 
in addition  even after a large service provider has approved our product for purchase  their future purchases are uncertain because we generally do not enter into long term supply agreements or requirements contracts with those parties 
delays associated with a customer s internal approval and contracting procedures  procurement practices  and testing and acceptance processes are common and may cause potential sales to be delayed or foregone 
as a result of these and related factors  the sales cycle of new products for large customers typically ranges from six to twenty four months 
over the past year  our major customers have decreased their volume of orders  implemented longer purchase cycles  and decreased capital expenditures for telecom and cable equipment 
we generally do not sell our products with rights of return  and on the few occasions when we have agreed to provide customers with rights of return  we have deferred recognition of sales revenue until the rights of return have lapsed 
we generally do not provide extended payment terms to our customers 
marketing 
we market and promote sales of our products by the following activities our product marketing group researches new opportunities  prepares product definitions with our research and development group  and defines new features to create new products  the overall marketing group hosts a variety of seminars several times a year in the united states  asia  europe  and latin america to improve the sales effectiveness of our manufacturers representatives and international distributors  
table of contents our product marketing engineers  regional sales managers  and account managers travel extensively with our manufacturers representatives and international distributors to develop new product opportunities with customers and to support their presentations  the marketing communications group maintains a public web site  publishes brochures and specification sheets  and generates press releases and publicity to increase our recognition in the telecommunications industry  our technical publications group prepares user s manuals  field manuals  quick reference guides  and product operation videos to serve the needs of our users  our training department prepares customer training presentations and sponsors sunrise university  a factory based training program for our customers 
customer service 
we believe that customer service following the sale of our products is a critical ingredient to our success 
we provide customer service in numerous ways  including the following providing rapid instrument repair services  operating a hour per day telephone support line to help customers who are having difficulty using our products in their particular application  maintaining a proprietary web site containing on line  up to the minute product repair information for our distributors international repair centers  with a factory certified technician training program for our distributors international repair center technicians  and measuring the satisfaction of our customers and communicating this information to our quality group 
seasonality our sales tend to be seasonal in nature and are typically tied to the buying patterns of our customers 
prior to  the largest volume of quarterly sales had usually been during the last calendar quarter of the year  as customers spent the unused portions of their annual budgets 
in and  there was a change in this fourth quarter seasonality as our customers had fewer remaining unused budget dollars available to generate an increase in the fourth quarter seasonal sales 
in  however  we saw a return to the pre pattern  with increased sales in the fourth quarter 
market conditions in our industry are currently too uncertain for us to predict whether or not this pattern will persist 
the first quarter of any given year has historically been a light period for orders because our large customers typically do not release their budgets for the year until mid quarter 
we expect that our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly and will be difficult to predict  given the nature of our business 
many factors could cause our operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter in the future  including the lengthy and unpredictable buying patterns of our customers  the degree to which our customers allocate and spend their yearly budgets  and the timing of our customers budget processes 
backlog our backlog of customer orders at december  was approximately million compared to approximately million at december  variations in the size and delivery schedules of purchase orders that we receive  as well as changes in customers delivery requirements may result in substantial fluctuations in the amount of backlog orders for our products from quarter to quarter 
research and development we have assembled a team of highly skilled engineering professionals who are experienced at designing telecommunications and cable tv service verification test equipment 
our engineering personnel have expertise in a 
table of contents number of fields  including interfacing test equipment with digital loop carrier  voice and data switching technology  local loop equipment  and operations support systems 
we spent approximately million on research and development in  million in  and million in research and development represents our largest direct employment expense 
at december   we had a total of employees engaged in research and development in san jose  california  norcross  georgia  anjou  canada  modena  italy  taipei  taiwan  and geneva  switzerland 
we believe that our continued success depends on our ability to anticipate and respond to changes in the telecommunications industry and anticipate and satisfy our customers preferences and requirements 
accordingly  we continually review and evaluate technological and regulatory changes affecting the telecommunications industry and seek to offer products and capabilities that solve customers operational challenges and improve their efficiency 
in general  we spend anywhere from two months to four years developing a new product 
regulations and industry standards our products are designed to comply with a significant number of industry standards and regulations  some of which are evolving as new technologies are deployed 
in the united states  our products must comply with various regulations defined by the federal communications commission and underwriters laboratories as well as industry standards established by telcordia technologies  inc  formerly bellcore  and the american national standards institute 
internationally  our products must comply with standards established by the european committee for electrotechnical standardization  the european committee for standardization  the european telecommunications standards institute  telecommunications authorities in various countries  and with recommendations of the international telecommunications union 
the failure of our products to comply  or delays in compliance  with the various existing and evolving standards could negatively impact our ability to sell our products 
manufacturing our production process consists of planning  procurement  fabrication  rework  system assembly  system final test  software option customization  and shipping 
we purchase substantially all parts  including resistors  integrated circuit boards  lcds  and printed circuit boards  from distributors and manufacturers worldwide 
we package these parts into kits and send them to contract manufacturers to assemble them into printed circuit boards 
we perform substantially all remaining manufacturing operations 
we maintain sourcing and manufacturing operations in san jose  california  norcross  georgia  anjou  canada  taipei  taiwan  and modena  italy 
in and  we performed the majority of sourcing  contract manufacturing  and final assembly in san jose  california and taipei  taiwan 
our san jose  california and modena  italy operations are iso certified 
in  we increased our manufacturing capacity in taiwan  while reducing capacity in san jose to increase overall production cost effectiveness 
our subsidiary in taiwan  taiwan sunrise telecom company limited  is a turn key manufacturer and local procurement operation 
we also own an equity interest of in top union  a manufacturing company located in taipei  taiwan that has performed board level manufacturing as part of the taiwan sunrise telecom company limited turn key operation 
we intend to continue increasing the use of our taiwan subsidiary for complete turn key manufacturing to help lower our manufacturing costs 
in our manufacturing process  we purchase many key products  such as microprocessors  bus interface chips  optical components  and oscillators  from a single source or from that source s sole supplier 
we rely exclusively on third party subcontractors to manufacture certain sub assemblies  and we have retained  from time to time  third party design services in the development of our products 
we do not have long term supply agreements with these vendors 
in general  we make advance purchases of some products and components to ensure an adequate supply  particularly 
table of contents for products that require lead times of up to nine months to manufacture 
for a discussion of the risks associated with our reliance on these third parties  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk factors affecting future operating results dependence on sole and single source suppliers 
a total of million of our net property and equipment is located in the united states and million is located in other countries

competition the market for field verification test equipment is fragmented and intensely competitive  both inside and outside the united states  and is subject to rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  regulatory developments  and varied and changing customer preferences and requirements 
we compete with a number of united states and international suppliers that vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the products and services offered 
the following table sets forth our principal competitors in each of our product categories product category principal competitors wire line access acterna corporation  agilent technologies  inc fiber optics sonet sdh digital lightwave  inc  acterna corporation  agilent technologies  inc 
cable tv acterna corporation  agilent technologies  inc signaling inet technologies  inc  nettest we expect that  as our industry and market evolve  new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market share 
we anticipate that competition in our markets will increase with the result that we will face greater threats to our market share  price pressure on our products  and the likelihood that  over time  our profitability may decrease 
however  some of our competitors are experiencing unprecedented financial difficulties due to the generally difficult times in the telecommunications marketplace 
as some of these competitors are impacted to a greater degree than we are  these difficulties may also present some opportunities for us to increase market share by better maintaining our business operations in comparison 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in our market include the following continued high level of investment in research and development and marketing  speed of new product development and introductions to market  depth of product functionality  ease of installation  integration  and use  system reliability and performance  price and financing terms  technical support and customer service  size and stability of the vendor s operations  and compliance with government and industry standards 
intellectual property and proprietary technology our intellectual property  including our proprietary technology  processes and know how  trade secrets  patents  trademarks  and copyrights  is important to our business and to our continued success 
we have six patents relating to 
table of contents communications testers  and we have filed several applications for additional patents with the us patent and trademark office and with foreign patent offices 
our research and development and manufacturing process typically involves the use and development of a variety of forms of intellectual property and proprietary technology  although no one particular form of this intellectual property and proprietary technology is material to our business 
in addition  we incorporate software  some of which we may license from several third party sources 
these licenses generally renew automatically on an annual basis 
we believe that alternative technologies for this licensed software are available both domestically and internationally 
we protect our proprietary technology by the following means relying on intellectual property law  including patent  trade secret  copyright  and trademark law and by initiating litigation when necessary to enforce our rights  limiting access to our software  documentation  and other proprietary information  and entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees 
in the future  we may receive notices from holders of patents that raise issues as to possible infringement by our products 
as the number of telecommunications test  measurement  and network management products increases and the functionality of these products further overlap  we believe that we may become subject to allegations of infringement given the nature of the telecommunications industry and the high incidence of these kinds of claims 
questions of infringement and the validity of patents in the field of telecommunications technologies involve highly technical and subjective analyses 
these kinds of proceedings are time consuming and expensive to defend or resolve  result in substantial diversion of management resources  cause product shipment delays  and could force us to enter into royalty or license agreements rather than dispute the merits of the proceeding initiated against us

when used in this report  the word expects  anticipates  estimates  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected 
such risks and uncertainties are set forth below under risk factors affecting future operating results 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
overview we develop  manufacture  and market service verification equipment to pre qualify  verify  and diagnose telecommunications  cable  and internet networks 
we design our products to increase technicians effectiveness in the field and to provide realistic network simulations for equipment manufacturers to test their products 
our customers include incumbent local exchange carriers  competitive local exchange carriers  other service providers  and network infrastructure suppliers and installers throughout north america  latin america  europe  africa  the middle east  and the asia pacific region 
sources of net sales we sell our products predominantly to large telecommunications and cable tv service providers 
these types of customers generally commit significant resources to an evaluation of our and our competitors products and require each vendor to expend substantial time  effort  and money educating them about the value of the proposed solutions 
delays associated with potential customers internal approval and contracting procedures  procurement practices  and testing and acceptance processes are common and may cause potential sales to be delayed or foregone 
as a result of these and related factors  the sales cycle of new products for large customers typically ranges from six to twenty four months 
during the past two years  we have observed a significant decline in capital spending in the telecommunications industry  which may lengthen the sales cycle further 
substantially all of our sales are made on the basis of purchase orders rather than long term agreements or requirements contracts 
as a result  we commit resources to the development and production of products without having received advance or long term purchase commitments from customers 
we anticipate that our operating results for any given period will continue to be dependent to a significant extent on purchase orders  which can be delayed or cancelled by our customers without penalty 
historically  a significant portion of our net sales has resulted from a small number of relatively large orders from a limited number of customers 
however  no customers comprised more than of our sales in and in  there were two customers that comprised and of our net sales 
in  million  or  of our sales were from our copper loop test head sold to lucent technologies or to solectron  a contract manufacturer for lucent technologies 
solectron integrated this product into the stinger dslam product that it manufactures for lucent technologies 
the initial order for the cooper loop test head was completed during the second quarter of  and the prospects for significant future orders of the copper loop test head product remain uncertain 
overall  we anticipate that our operating results for a given period will be dependent on a small number of customers 
our sales have been seasonal in nature and tied to the buying patterns of our customers 
prior to  the largest volume of quarterly sales had usually been during the last calendar quarter of the year  as customers spent the unused portions of their annual budgets 
in and  there was a change in this fourth quarter seasonality as our customers had fewer remaining unused budget dollars available to generate an increase in the fourth quarter seasonal sales 
in  however  we saw a return to the pre pattern  with increased sales in the fourth quarter 
market conditions in our industry are currently too uncertain for us to predict whether or not this pattern will persist 
the first 
table of contents quarter of any given year has historically been a light period for orders because our large customers typically do not release their budgets for the year until mid quarter 
we expect that our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly and will be difficult to predict  given the nature of our business 
many factors could cause our operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter in the future  including the lengthy and unpredictable buying patterns of our customers  the degree to which our customers allocate and spend their yearly budgets  and the timing of our customers budget processes 
currently  competition in the telecommunications and cable equipment market is intense and is characterized by declining prices due to increased competition and new products and due to declining customer demand 
due to these market conditions and potential pricing pressures from large customers in the future  we expect that the average selling price for our products will decline over time 
if we fail to reduce our production costs accordingly or fail to introduce higher margin new products  there will be a corresponding decline in our gross margin percentage 
see risk factors affecting future operating results competition and risks of the telecommunications industry 
a substantial portion of our net sales comes from customers located outside of the united states  and we believe that future growth may require expansion of our sales into international markets 
currently  we maintain a manufacturing facility in taipei  taiwan  manufacturing  research  development  and sales facilities in modena  italy  manufacturing  research  development  and sales facilities in anjou  canada  and research and development facilities in geneva  switzerland and hamburg  germany 
we also have a representative liaison office in beijing  china  a foreign sales corporation in barbados  and sales offices in tokyo  japan and seoul  korea 
we have a small amount of sales denominated in euros and the canadian dollar and have  in the past  used derivative financial instruments to hedge our foreign exchange risks 
as of december   we had no derivative financial instruments 
to date  foreign exchange exposure from sales has not been material to our operations 
we have also been exposed to fluctuations in non us currency exchange rates related to our manufacturing activities in taiwan 
in the future  we expect that a growing portion of international sales may be denominated in currencies other than us dollars  thereby exposing us to gains and losses on non us currency transactions 
we may choose to limit this exposure by using hedging strategies 
see risk factors affecting future operating results risks of international operations 
cost of sales our cost of sales consist primarily of the following direct material costs of product components  manuals  product documentation  and product accessories  production wages  taxes  and benefits  allocated production overhead costs  warranty costs  the costs of board level assembly by third party contract manufacturers  and scrapped and reserved material purchased for use in the production process 
we recognize direct cost of sales  wages  taxes  benefits  and allocated overhead costs at the same time we recognize revenue for products sold 
we expense scrapped materials as incurred 
our industry is characterized by limited sources and long lead times for the materials and components that we use to manufacture our products 
if we underestimate our requirements  we may have inadequate inventory  resulting in additional product costs for expediting delivery of long lead time components 
an increase in the cost of components 
table of contents could result in lower margins 
additionally  these long lead times have in the past  and may in the future  cause us to purchase larger quantities of some parts  increasing our investment in inventory and the risk of the parts obsolescence 
any subsequent write off of inventory could result in lower margins 
see risk factors affecting future operating results dependence on sole and single source suppliers 
operating costs we classify our operating expenses into three general operational categories selling and marketing  research and development  and general and administrative 
our operating expenses include stock based compensation expense  amortization of certain intangible assets  and  through december   amortization of goodwill 
effective january   and in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is no longer amortized 
we classify charges to the research and development  selling and marketing  and general and administrative expense categories based on the nature of these expenditures 
although each of these three categories includes expenses that are unique to the category type  each category also includes commonly recurring expenditures that typically relate to all of these categories  such as salaries  amortization of stock based compensation  employee benefits  travel and entertainment costs  allocated communication costs  rent and facilities costs  and third party professional service fees 
the selling and marketing category of operating expenses also includes expenditures specific to the selling and marketing group  such as commissions  public relations and advertising  trade shows  and marketing materials 
the research and development category of operating expenses includes expenditures specific to the research and development group  such as design and prototyping costs 
the general and administrative category of operating expenses includes expenditures specific to the general and administrative group  such as legal and professional fees and amortization of identifiable intangible assets 
we allocate the total cost of overhead and facilities to each of the functional areas that use overhead and facilities  based upon the square footage of facilities used  or the headcount in each of these areas 
these allocated charges include facility rent  utilities  communications charges  and depreciation expenses for our building  equipment  and office furniture 
in and  we recorded amortization of deferred stock based compensation expense of million and million  respectively  related to the grant of pre ipo options to purchase our common stock at exercise prices subsequently deemed to be below fair market value 
total compensation expense related to these options  which were granted in and the first quarter of  is amortized on a straight line basis  over the respective four year vesting periods of the options  to the departments of the employees who received these below market option grants 
during and  we allocated amortization of deferred stock based compensation expense of million to cost of sales  million and million  respectively  to research and development expense  million to selling and marketing expense  and million and million  respectively  to general and administrative expense 
at december   million of deferred stock based compensation expense remained to be amortized  of which million is expected to be amortized during also  during and  we charged million and million  respectively  to general and administrative expense for amortization of intangible assets obtained through various business acquisitions 
acquisitions on february   we acquired pro 
tel 
srl and subsidiaries pro 
tel  an italian manufacturer of distributed network signaling analysis equipment  its us affiliate  and the assets of an unrelated us distributor  for million in cash  acquisition costs  and short term notes payable and  shares of our stock  valued at million 
we accounted for this acquisition using the purchase method of accounting and  accordingly  recorded goodwill and other 
table of contents intangible assets of million  to be amortized on a straight line basis over their original estimated useful lives of two to five years 
at december   we had million in unamortized goodwill remaining from the pro 
tel

in accordance with sfas no 
 we ceased amortizing this goodwill as of january  we will review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as required by sfas no 
in addition  we recorded deferred stock based compensation for stock options granted to employees of pro 
tel 
in the first quarter of in the amount of million  to be amortized on a straight line basis over the four year vesting period of the options 
concurrent with the acquisition  we entered into non compete agreements with certain employees of pro

that will result in payments to these employees totaling million over four years  provided that the employees perform as agreed to under the agreements 
we are amortizing the corresponding non compete assets on a straight line basis over their four year estimated useful lives 
on january   we acquired avantron technologies  inc avantron  a canadian company that specializes in the design and manufacture of cable tv modem spectrum analyzers and performance monitoring systems  for million in cash  acquisition costs  and short term notes payable

at december   we had million in unamortized goodwill remaining from the avantron acquisition 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we ceased amortizing this goodwill as of january  we will review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as required by sfas no 
on february   we acquired the calan cable tv test business from agilent technologies for approximately million in cash and acquisition costs

on june   we acquired the adsl tester business from integrated telecom express  inc itex for approximately  in cash 
we recorded goodwill of  which we will review for impairment on an annual basis as required by sfas no 
on september   we acquired luciol instruments sa luciol  a swiss corporation specializing in fiber optic measurement and instrumentation  for approximately million in cash and acquisition costs 
we recorded acquired intangible assets of million  to be amortized on a straight line basis over their original estimated useful lives of five years  and goodwill of million  which we will review for impairment on an annual basis as required by sfas no 
concurrent with this acquisition  we entered into a non compete agreement with certain former owners of luciol that will result in payments to the former owners totaling approximately  over four years  provided that they perform as agreed to under the agreements 
we are amortizing the corresponding non compete assets on a straight line basis over their four year estimated useful lives 
we also entered into employment agreements with these same former owners that will result in bonus payments to the former owners totaling approximately  over four years  in addition to their regular salaries and subject to certain conditions  primarily related to their continued employment by sunrise 
on february   we acquired substantially all of the assets of gie gmbh gie  a german corporation located in mannheim  specializing in wireless and rf measurement instrumentation for a total of approximately  in cash and acquisition costs 
we also entered into non compete agreements totaling  with the shareholders of gie  which are payable over four years 
we believe that acquisitions and joint ventures may be an important part of our growth and competitive strategy

table of contents critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  and we have prepared our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations based on these financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to apply accounting policies using estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable 
actual results may differ from these estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
we consider critical those accounting policies that meet both of the following criteria they require our most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  which often result from a need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain  and they are among the most important of our accounting policies to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
these critical accounting policies are determination of our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  valuation of excess and obsolete inventory  accounting for warranty reserves  deferred income tax assets and liabilities  and revenue recognition 
we determine our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable by making our best estimate considering our historical accounts receivable collection experience and the information that we have about the status of our accounts receivable balances 
if future conditions cause our collection experience to change or if we later obtain different information about the status of any or all of our accounts receivable  additional allowances for doubtful accounts receivable may be required 
we determine the valuation of excess and obsolete inventory by making our best estimate considering the current quantities of inventory on hand and our forecast of the need for this inventory to support future sales of our products 
we often have only limited information on which to base our forecasts  and if future sales differ from these forecasts  the valuation of excess and obsolete inventory may change 
we offer a three year warranty covering parts and labor on our wire line access products and fiber optic products sold in the united states  and generally offer a one year warranty covering parts and labor for our products sold in all other countries  with the option to purchase a two year extended warranty 
our cable tv and signaling products are covered by a one year warranty 
at the time we recognize revenue from a product s sale  we determine the reserve for the future cost of meeting our obligations under the standard warranties by considering our historical experience with warranty costs 
if the future costs of meeting these obligations differ from the historical experience  additional reserves for warranty obligations may be required 
we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and for the future tax consequences attributable to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
in assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the ultimate realization of certain deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the related temporary differences become deductible 
if we obtain information that causes our forecast of future taxable income to change or if taxable income differs from our forecast  we may have to revise the carrying value of our deferred tax assets  which would affect our net income in the period in which the change occurs 
the ultimate realization of certain deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to carry forward or back operating losses and tax credits 
if changes in the tax laws occur that inhibit our ability to carry forward or back operating losses or tax credits  we will recognize the effect on our deferred tax assets in the results of operations of the period that includes the enactment date of the change 
furthermore  we measure our deferred tax assets and liabilities using the enacted tax laws expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which temporary differences are expected to be recovered 
table of contents or settled 
if tax laws change  we will recognize the effect on our deferred tax assets and liabilities in the results of operations of the period that includes the enactment date of the change 
we recognize revenue when earned 
therefore  we recognize revenue from product sales upon shipment  assuming collectibility of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
when the arrangement with the customer includes future obligations or is contingent on obtaining customer acceptance  we recognize revenue when those obligations have been met or customer acceptance has been received 
we defer revenue from sales of extended warranties and recognize it over the extended warranty term  which is generally two years 
we recognize revenue for out of warranty repairs when we ship the repaired product 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain operating data as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated percentage of net sales years ended december  net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses research and development selling and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses income loss from operations other income  net income loss before income taxes income taxes benefit net income loss comparison of years ended december  and net sales 
net sales decreased  to million in from million in sales in of our wire line access products decreased by million  sales of our fiber optics products decreased by million  and sales of our signaling products decreased by million 
these sales decreases were generally due to reductions in capital spending by our customers in the telecommunications industry 
these sales decreases were partially offset by a million increase in sales of our cable tv products 
of our total increase in sales  million was from the calan acquisition 
the remaining million increase was due to our existing product lines  primarily the cm  and the increasing acceptance of these products within the cable tv industry 
during  our cable business continued to grow driven by the success of the cm and by the continuing introduction of the network profiler acquired in development from agilent in our acquisition of calan 
in addition  the cm made its first sales at the end of  and represents an extension of the cm family 
overall  we gained market share with our cable products during the year 
on the telecom side  introduction of the stt  additional mtt modules  and the sdh stm all provided a source of new revenues to help stabilize performance 
looking ahead  we expect net sales during the first quarter of to be lower than our reported net sales from the fourth 
table of contents quarter of of approximately million  but higher than our reported net sales from the first quarter of of approximately million 
during the years ended december  and  our quarterly net sales were as follows in thousands quarter ended mar 
 june  sept

 net sales decrease during each quarter of  there was in improving trend in the decrease in sales compared to the same quarter of sales in decreased million or in north america  million or in europe africa middle east  million or in asia pacific  and million or in latin america as compared to sales in decreased million or in north america  million or in europe africa middle east  million or in asia pacific  and million or in latin america as compared to the decrease in north american sales during was primarily due to a million decrease in sales of our wire line access products  a million decrease in the sales of our fiber optics products  and a million decrease in the sales of our signaling products 
these decreases were partially offset by an million increase in the sales of our cable tv products 
of the growth in our cable tv product sales  of the increase in over relates to products from the calan business acquired during the first quarter of the decreases in our north american sales were primarily the result of decreased capital spending by our telecommunications customers 
in addition  over the past year  some dsl providers have encouraged customer self installation and have reported that up to of their customers perform self installation successfully 
the self installation procedure reduces the need for technicians to test for dsl service  reducing the demand for our dsl wire line access products as our equipment is used primarily for troubleshooting rather than installation 
international sales  including north american sales in canada  decreased to million  or of net sales  in  from million  or of net sales in the decrease in international sales in absolute dollars is primarily due to decreased sales of our wire line access product lines and our fiber optics products 
cost of sales 
cost of sales consists primarily of direct material  warranty  and personnel costs related to the manufacturing of our products and allocated overhead 
cost of sales decreased  to million in from million in this decrease is primarily due to the decrease in net sales volumes 
cost of sales represented and of net sales in and  respectively 
we expect that cost of sales may increase as a percentage of sales in the future due to possible fluctuations in our overall product mix  if international sales grow as a percentage of total sales  or if pricing pressures increase 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of the costs of payroll and benefits for engineers  equipment  and consulting services 
research and development expenses decreased  to million in from million in this decrease is primarily due to decreased payroll dedicated to research and development activities 
research and development expenses represented of net sales in and of net sales in the increase as a percentage of net sales is primarily due to product sales decreasing more rapidly than research and development expenditures  as we continue to invest in product development and expansion of our product lines 
research and development expenses may increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in product development and expand our product lines 

table of contents selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of the costs of payroll and benefits for selling and marketing personnel  manufacturers representative and direct sales commissions  travel and facilities expenses related to selling and marketing  and trade show and advertising expenses 
selling and marketing expenses decreased  to million in from million in these decreases are primarily due to reductions in advertising and printing expenses  headcount reductions among selling and marketing personnel  and reduced commission expenses 
commission expenses decreased primarily due to the decrease in our sales  particularly north american sales  on which we make the preponderance of our commission payments 
selling and marketing expenses represented of net sales in and of net sales in the increase as a percentage of net sales in is primarily due to product sales decreasing more rapidly than selling and marketing expenditures and our efforts to continue to develop the market for and sell our products 
selling and marketing expenses may increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in our selling and marketing capabilities 
in addition  commissions included in the selling and marketing expenses will continue to fluctuate with the fluctuation of revenues and sales mix each quarter 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll and benefits  facilities  other costs of our finance and administrative departments  legal and accounting expenses  and amortization expenses for goodwill and other intangible assets related to our business acquisitions 
general and administrative expenses decreased  to million in from million in these decreases are primarily due to a million decrease in amortization of purchased intangible assets resulting from the cessation of amortization of goodwill related to acquisitions beginning on january  the remaining million of the decrease is primarily due to cost reduction measures 
general and administrative expenses represented of net sales in and of net sales in general and administrative expenses may increase in absolute dollars if we experience growth in our business  expand our infrastructure  or pursue additional acquisitions 
other income  net 
other income  net primarily represents interest earned on cash and investment balances 
other income  net decreased to million in from million in this decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in interest income as our cash  cash equivalents  and investments in marketable securities declined and interest rates declined 
income taxes expense benefit 
income tax expense benefit consists of federal  state  and international income taxes 
we recorded an income tax benefit of million in and income tax expense of million in our effective income tax rates were in and in our income tax benefit and our change to a effective income tax rate in were due to our loss before income taxes 
comparison of years ended december  and net sales 
net sales decreased million  or  to million in from million in sales of our wire line access products  including dsl products  accounted for million of the net sales decrease and sales of our signaling products accounted for million of the net sales decrease 
these decreases were offset by an increase of million in sales of our cable tv products and an increase of million in sales of our fiber optics products 
of the million cable tv products sales increase  million came from sales by our avantron subsidiary  which we acquired in  and million came from increased sales of our existing product lines

the decrease in north american sales from to is due to lower sales of our wire line access products  including dsl  and lower sales of our protocol and fiber optics products 
our wire line access product sales decreased million in north america from to of this decrease  million was from reduced copper loop test head sales for lucent technologies stinger dslam product  which decreased from million in to million in north american sales of our protocol products decreased million and our fiber optics products decreased million from to the decreases in our north american sales were primarily the result of decreased capital spending by our telecommunications customers

international sales  including north american sales to canada  decreased to million  or of net sales  in from million  or of net sales  in the decrease in international sales is primarily due to decreased sales of our wire line access product lines  including dsl  which were partially offset by increased sales of our fiber optics products 
cost of sales 
cost of sales decreased  to million in from million in this decrease is primarily due to the decrease in net sales from to cost of sales were of net sales in versus of net sales in the increase as a percentage of net sales resulted primarily from an increased presence in our sales mix of cable tv products  lower margin wire line access products  and international sales  which tend to carry lower margins than north american sales because they often go through distributor networks 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased  to million in from million in this increase is primarily due to costs associated with increased staffing dedicated to research and development activities 
research and development expenses were of net sales in and of net sales in the increase as a percentage of net sales in is primarily due to decreased product sales while research and development expenditures increased  as we continue to invest in product development and expansion of our product lines 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses decreased  to million in from million in this decrease is primarily due to a decrease in commissions expense 
commission expense decreased primarily due to the decrease in our sales  particularly north american sales  for which we make the preponderance of our commission payments 
selling and marketing expenses were of net sales in and of net sales in the increase as a percentage of net sales in is primarily due to decreased oem sales  which led to lower commission  occupancy  and salary and related expenses as a percentage of sales than in general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased  to million in from million in general and administrative expenses were of net sales in and of net sales in the increase in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales is primarily due to increased amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets related to recent business acquisitions  amortization of deferred stock based compensation  and increased staffing and related costs associated with the growth of our business as a public company for the full year of other income  net 
other income  net increased to million in from million in the increase in resulted primarily from increased interest earned on higher balances of cash and cash equivalents resulting 
table of contents from increased cash flow from operations  interest income earned for a full year in on the net proceeds received from our initial public offering in july  and income earned from a grant from the italian government 
income tax expense 
we recorded income tax expense of million in and million in our effective income tax rates were in and in our income tax expense and effective income tax rate are lower in than in primarily due to lower levels of income 
liquidity and capital resources historically  we have financed our operations and satisfied our capital expenditure requirements primarily through cash flow from operations 
additionally  in july of  we received net proceeds totaling million from an initial public offering 
to date  we have used million of these net proceeds to acquire complementary businesses  products or technology  construct our corporate headquarters  repay amounts drawn under our line of credit  and repay notes payable 
funds that have not been used have been invested in money market funds  auction rate securities  and marketable debt securities 
as of december    and  we had working capital of million  million  and million  respectively  and cash and cash equivalents of million  million  and million  respectively 
as of december    and  we also had million  million  and million  respectively  in investments in marketable securities 
cash provided by operating activities was million in  million in  and million in operating cash flows decreased during as compared to primarily because we went from having net income in to a net loss in furthermore  although we continued to have net collections of accounts receivable and net reductions in inventory purchases during  the amount of these net collections and net reductions was significantly less than during the factors decreasing operating cash flow during as compared to were partially offset by a reduction in payments on our accounts payable and accrued expenses 
operating cash flows increased during as compared to primarily as a result of net collections of accounts receivable and a net reduction in inventory purchases 
also  the amount of non cash charges against net income increased significantly in from this was primarily the result of increased goodwill amortization from the acquisition of avantron technologies  inc in the first quarter of and increased depreciation resulting from the completion of our new corporate headquarters building in san jose  ca  also in the first quarter of the factors increasing operating cash flow during as compared to were partially offset by decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses and in income taxes payable 
cash used in investing activities was million in  million in  and million in the million decrease in net cash used in investing activities during from is primarily due to decreased amounts paid for acquisitions and decreased capital expenditures 
capital expenditures during included million for land and million for construction of our facility in san jose  california  which did not recur in  and we also reduced our expenditures on equipment and other capital assets during offsetting these reductions in cash flows used in investing activities was a loan made to our chief executive officer in early the increase in net cash used in investing activities during from is primarily due to increased acquisitions and capital expenditures  partially offset by a reduction in net purchases of marketable securities 
cash used in financing activities was million in and cash provided by financing activities was million in  and million in the increase in net cash used in financing activities during from is primarily due to increased repurchases of our common stock and a reduction in proceeds from common stock issued under our employee stock purchase plan 
during  we completed the repurchase of our stock under a plan approved by the board of directors in under this plan  a total of million shares have been repurchased since 
table of contents for an aggregate total consideration of million 
the decrease in net cash provided by financing activities during from is primarily due to the effect of our initial public offering on year cash flows 
during  we had a million revolving line of credit with a financial institution 
the line of credit expired on september   and was not renewed 
at december   we did not have any balances outstanding under our remaining lines of credit 
our outstanding debt at december  consisted primarily of a million loan from the italian government  payable over a period of eight years through semi annual payments staring in  and thirteen notes payable related to previous acquisitions totaling million  that are being paid off in quarterly installments ending in we believe that current cash balances and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital  capital expenditures  and other activities for at least the next months 
however  a large acquisition of complementary businesses  products or technologies  or material joint ventures could require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing 
we cannot assure you that such additional financing would be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
such an acquisition is not anticipated at this time 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any material off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our current or future financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  or capital resources 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes  as of december   the timing of future cash payments due under certain contractual obligations in thousands payments due in total less than year years years more than years borrowings and notes payable operating lease obligations total risk factors affecting future operating results quarterly fluctuations because our quarterly operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and are likely to fluctuate significantly in the future  our stock price may decline and may be volatile 
in the past  we have experienced significant fluctuations in our quarterly results due to a number of factors beyond our control 
in the future  our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly and may be difficult to predict given the nature of our business 
many factors could cause our operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter in the future  including the following economic downturns reducing demand for telecommunication and cable equipment and services  the size and timing of orders from our customers  which may be exacerbated by the increased length and unpredictability of our customers buying patterns  and our ability to ship these orders on a timely basis  the degree to which our customers have allocated and spent their yearly budgets  
table of contents the uneven pace of technological innovation  the development of products responding to these technological innovations by us and our competitors  and customer acceptance of these products and innovations  the varied degree of price  product  and technology competition  and our customers and competitors responses to these changes  the relative percentages of our products sold domestically and internationally  the mix of the products we sell and the varied margins associated with these products  and the timing of our customers budget processes 
the factors listed above may affect our business and stock price in several ways 
given our high fixed costs from overhead  research and development  and advertising and marketing  and other activities necessary to run our business  if our net sales are below our expectations in any quarter  we may not be able to adjust spending accordingly 
for example  in our net sales declined from  but our operating expenses only declined because of fixed costs 
our stock price may decline and may be volatile  particularly if public market analysts and investors perceive the factors listed above to exist  whether or not that perception is accurate 
furthermore  the above factors  taken together may make it more difficult for us to issue additional equity in the future or raise debt financing to fund future acquisitions and accelerate growth 
declining sales we are experiencing decreased sales and increased difficulty in predicting future operating results 
as a result of current unfavorable economic and market conditions  our year to year sales have been declining  we are unable to predict future sales accurately  and we are currently unable to provide long term guidance for future financial performance 
the conditions contributing to this difficulty include the following uncertainty regarding the capital spending plans of the major telecommunications and cable carriers upon whom we depend for sales  the telecommunications and cable carriers current limited access to capital required for expansion  lower near term sales visibility  and general market and economic uncertainty 
based on these and other factors  many of our major customers have reduced  modified  cancelled or rescheduled orders for our products and have expressed uncertainty as to their future requirements 
economic downturn our operating results and financial condition could continue to be harmed if the telecommunications industry remains over supplied 
the current economic downturn has resulted in reduced purchasing and capital spending in the telecommunications industry  which has been in a downward cycle characterized by diminished product demand  excess manufacturing capacity and the increasing erosion of average selling prices 
the downturn has already adversely affected the businesses and cash flows of many of our customers and has even caused some of them to file for bankruptcy 
we are uncertain how long the current downturn will last 
continuation of the downturn or any further decline in our customers markets or in general economic conditions would likely result in a further reduction in demand for our products and services and also would further limit our customers ability to pay for the products that they buy from us 
all of these circumstances could harm our consolidated financial position  results of operations  cash flows and stock price  and could limit our ability to reach our goals for restoring long term profitability 

table of contents long term impact of cost controls the actions we have taken in response to the recent slowdown in demand for our products and services could have long term adverse effects on our business 
our business has been experiencing lower revenues due to decreased or cancelled customer orders 
from the third quarter of through the first quarter of  we experienced sequential declines in orders 
in  net sales were significantly below and to scale back our operations and to reduce our expenses in response to this decreased demand for our products and services and lower revenue  we have reduced our workforce  restricted hiring  reduced and frozen employee salaries  and reduced discretionary spending 
since march  we have reduced our workforce  including temporary employees and net of additions  by approximately people  or  and we may experience further workforce reductions in the future in the event current order levels do not improve 
in addition  in may and february  we instituted an average pay reduction in and an average pay reduction in  applicable to many employees globally  wherever legally permissible 
some of the reductions in pay took effect via a reduction in hours for certain employees  in accordance with local law 
we have also tightly restricted any subsequent increase in salaries 
in addition to these measures  we are continuing our initiatives to streamline our operations 
there are several risks inherent in our efforts to transition to a reduced cost structure 
these include the risk that we will not be able to reduce expenditures quickly enough and sustain them at a level necessary to restore profitability  and that we may have to undertake further restructuring initiatives that would entail additional charges 
in addition  there is the risk that cost cutting initiatives will impair our future ability to develop and market products effectively and remain competitive 
each of the above measures could have long term effects on our business by reducing our pool of technical talent  decreasing or slowing improvements in our products  making it more difficult for us to respond to customers  limiting our ability to increase production quickly if and when the demand for our products increases  and limiting our ability to hire and retain key personnel 
these circumstances could cause our earnings to be lower than they otherwise might be 
dependence on wireline access products a significant portion of our sales have been from our wireline access products 
demand for these products has declined significantly and may decline further 
sales of our dsl and other wire line access products represented approximately of our net sales in and in currently  our dsl products are primarily used by a limited number of incumbent local exchange carriers  including the regional bell operating companies and competitive local exchange carriers who offer dsl services 
a competitive local exchange carrier is a company that  following the telecommunications act of  is authorized to compete in a local communications services market 
these parties  and other internet service providers and users  are continuously evaluating alternative high speed data access technologies  including cable modems  fiber optics  wireless technology  and satellite technologies  and may at any time adopt these competing technologies 
these competing technologies may ultimately prove to be superior to dsl services and reduce or eliminate the demand for our dsl products 
during and  the business prospects of many competitive local exchange carriers and incumbent local exchange carriers declined significantly 
some competitive local exchange carriers filed for bankruptcy or went out of business  and many local exchange carriers have experienced significant revenue declines 
due to these and other factors  we have seen a significant decline in demand for our dsl products 
if dsl deployment rates decrease or remain flat  demand for our dsl products may decline further 
it is not possible to predict whether any decline would be temporary or sustained 
accordingly  our future success is partially dependent upon whether dsl technology continues to gain growing and widespread market acceptance by exchange carriers  end users of their services  and other internet service providers and users 

table of contents in the past  our customers have deployed dsl equipment  including our products  in substantially larger volumes than their subscriber count 
over the past two years  many of our customers have decreased the rate at which they deploy dsl equipment 
this decrease has led to a decrease in demand for our products 
in addition  the inability of our current or future customers to acquire or retain subscribers as planned  or to respond to increased competition or reduced demand for their services could cause them to reduce further or to eliminate entirely their dsl deployment plans 
use of field technicians if service providers reduce their use of field technicians and continue successful implementation of a self service installation model  demand for our products could decrease 
to ensure quality service  our major service provider customers have historically sent a technician  who uses our products  into the field to verify service for installations 
sbc communications  qwest communications  bell south corporation  and verizon communications each encourage their customers to install dsl themselves 
over the past year  some dsl providers have reported that or more of their customers perform self installation successfully 
additionally  comcast has begun a self installation program for cable modem devices 
by encouraging customers to install dsl and cable access themselves  these companies intend to reduce their expenses and expedite installation for their customers 
to encourage self installation  these companies offer financial incentives 
if service providers continue successful implementation of these plans or choose to send technicians into the field only after a problem has been reported  or if alternative methods of verification become available  such as remote verification  the need for field technicians and the need for our products would decrease 
manufacturing capacity if demand for our products does not match our manufacturing capacity  our earnings may suffer 
because we cannot immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to rapidly changing market conditions  when demand does not meet our expectations  our manufacturing capacity may exceed our production requirements  and profitability may decline 
conversely  if during a market upturn we cannot increase our manufacturing capacity to meet product demand  we will not be able to fulfill orders in a timely manner  which in turn may have a negative effect on our earnings and overall business 
relocation of manufacturing facilities we are in the process of relocating our production facilities overseas  and problems with the relocation could interfere with our operations 
to reduce our manufacturing costs  we are transitioning most of our manufacturing operations from our san jose headquarters to our subsidiary in taipei  taiwan 
we believe that relocating our production facilities will lower our manufacturing costs  in particular labor costs  provide us with more flexibility to scale our operations to meet changing demand  and allow us to focus our engineering resources on new product development and product enhancements 
however  we may not be successful in transitioning our manufacturing operations overseas or maintaining the quality standards that our customers expect 
our failure to smoothly and successfully transition production could temporarily interrupt our operations and adversely impact our ability to run our business 
in addition  any failure or significant downtime in our production capabilities could prevent us from fulfilling and shipping customer orders and could harm our business 
risks of the telecommunications industry we face several risks regarding the telecommunications industry  including the possible effects of its unpredictable growth or decline  the possible effects of consolidation among our principal customers  and the risk that deregulation will slow 
after the passage of the telecommunications act of  the telecommunications industry experienced rapid growth 
the growth led to great innovations in technology  intense competition  short product life cycles  and  to some extent  regulatory uncertainty inside and outside the united states 
however  the course of the development of the 
table of contents telecommunications industry is difficult to predict 
companies operating in this industry have a difficult time forecasting future trends and developments and forecasting customer acceptance of competing technologies 
one possible effect of this uncertainty is that there is  and may continue to be  a delay or a reduction in these companies investment in their business and purchase of related equipment  such as our products  and a reduction in their and our access to capital 
in addition  deregulation may result in a delay or a reduction in the procurement cycle because of the general uncertainty involved with the transition period of businesses 
the growth that occurred after the passage of the telecommunications act of has slowed dramatically  and it is unknown whether or when it will resume 
this slowdown has resulted in reduced investment in the telecommunications industry in general and delayed purchase orders for service verification equipment such as our products in particular 
it is not possible to predict whether this slowdown will be temporary or sustained 
in addition  the telecommunications industry has been experiencing consolidation among its primary participants  such as incumbent local exchange carriers and competitive local exchange carriers  several of whom are our primary customers 
for example  in recent years  gte merged with bell atlantic to create verizon communications  inc  both of which were customers of ours 
continued consolidation may cause delay or cancellation of orders for our products 
the consolidation of our customers will likely provide them with greater negotiating leverage with us and may lead them to pressure us to lower the prices of our products 
if deregulation in international markets or in the united states were to slow or to take an unanticipated course  the telecommunications industry might suffer 
the effects of which  among others  would be the following a continued general slowdown in economic activity relating to the telecommunications industry and a resulting multiplier effect on the general economy  continued reduced investment in the telecommunications industry in general  and in dsl technology in particular  due to increased uncertainty regarding the future of the industry and this technology  greater consolidation of providers of high speed access technologies  which may not favor the development of dsl technology and which might provide these companies with greater negotiating leverage regarding the prices and other terms of the dsl products and services they purchase  uncertainty regarding judicial and administrative proceedings  which may affect the pace at which investment and deregulation continue to occur  and continued delay in purchase orders of service verification equipment  such as our products  if customers were to reduce their investment in new high speed access technologies 
cable industry health the cable industry has debt and income problems for the major players 
the cable industry has taken on significant debt as companies aggressively consolidated and built up impressive new digital networks to allow them to provide better picture quality  internet access  and even voice telephony 
profits have declined during the last year within the industry  however 
as a result  most cable companies expect to reduce their capital expenditures and or hiring  both of which could adversely impact our cable business more than we now expect 
customer concentration a limited number of customers account for a high percentage of our net sales  and any adverse factor affecting these customers or our relationship with these customers could cause our net sales to decrease 
our customer base is concentrated  and a relatively small number of companies have accounted for a large percentage of our net sales 
net sales from our top five customers in the united states represented approximately 
table of contents of total net sales in  in  and in in general  our customers are not subject to long term supply contracts with us  are not obligated to purchase a specific amount of products from us or to provide us with binding forecasts of purchases for any period 
the loss of a major customer or the reduction  delay  or cancellation of orders from one or more of our significant customers could cause our net sales and  therefore  profits to decline 
in addition  many of our customers are able to exert substantial negotiating leverage over us 
as a result  they may cause us to lower our prices for them and they may successfully negotiate other terms and provisions that may negatively affect our business and profits 
goodwill valuation our financial results could be materially and adversely affected if it is determined that the book value of goodwill is higher than fair value 
our balance sheet at december  includes an amount designated as goodwill that represents approximately of assets and of stockholders equity 
goodwill arises when an acquirer pays more for a business than the fair value of the acquired tangible and separately measurable intangible net assets 
under accounting pronouncement sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  beginning in january  the amortization of goodwill has been replaced with an impairment test  which requires that we compare the fair value of goodwill to its book value at least annually  and more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible impairment 
we completed our transitional impairment test of our goodwill as of january  and our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter and determined that goodwill was not impaired 
the impairment testing is based on a market capitalization analysis 
accordingly  if our market capitalization were to diminish significantly  the book value of goodwill could be higher than the fair value  and we would need to record a non cash impairment charge for the difference  which could materially and adversely affect our net income or loss 
product development if we are unable to develop new products successfully and enhance our existing products  our future success may be threatened 
the market for our products is characterized by rapid technological advances  changes in customer requirements and preferences  evolving industry and customer specific protocol standards  and frequent new product enhancements and introductions 
for example  at december   we had approximately million of orders for a cable product  which may be delayed or cancelled due to technical issues that must be overcome before the orders can be shipped 
our existing products and our products currently under development could be rendered obsolete by the introduction of products involving competing technologies  by the evolution of alternative technologies or new industry protocol standards  or by rival products by our competitors 
these market conditions are more complex and challenging because of the high degree to which the telecommunications industry is fragmented 
we believe our future success will depend  in part  upon our ability  on a timely and cost effective basis  to continue to do the following anticipate and respond to varied and rapidly changing customer preferences and requirements  a process made more challenging by our customers buying patterns  anticipate and develop new products and solutions for networks based on emerging technologies  such as the asynchronous transfer mode protocol that packs digital information into cells to be routed across a network  and internet telephony  which comprises voice  video  image  and data across the internet  that are likely to be characterized by continuing technological developments  evolving industry standards  and changing customer requirements  
table of contents invest in research and development to enhance our existing products and to introduce new verification and diagnostic products for the telecommunications  internet  cable network  and other markets  and support our products by investing in effective advertising  marketing  and customer support 
we cannot ensure that we will accomplish these objectives  and our failure to do so could have a material adverse impact on our market share  business  and financial results 
further  our percentage of net sales devoted to research and development is near a historic high for the company 
if we do not continue to reduce this percentage  our income levels will not return to their desired levels 
if we are successful in continuing to reduce this percentage  we may not continue to develop needed new products which could negatively impact our sources for new revenues 
sales implementation cycles the length and unpredictability of the sales and implementation cycles for our products makes it difficult to forecast revenues 
sales of our products often entail an extended decision making process on the part of prospective customers 
we frequently experience delays following initial contact with a prospective customer and expend substantial funds and management effort pursuing these sales 
our ability to forecast the timing and amount of specific sales is therefore limited 
as a result  the uneven buying patterns of our customers may cause fluctuations in our operating results  which could cause our stock price to decline 
other sources of delays that lead to long sales cycles  or even a sales loss  include current and potential customers internal budgeting procedures  internal approval and contracting procedures  procurement practices  and testing and acceptance processes 
recently  our customers budgeting procedures have lengthened 
the sales cycle for larger deployment now typically ranges from six to twenty four months 
the deferral or loss of one or more significant sales could significantly affect operating results in a particular quarter  especially if there are significant selling and marketing expenses associated with the deferred or lost sales 
managing growth and slowdowns we may have difficulty managing expansions and contractions in our operations  which could reduce our chances of maintaining or restoring our profitability 
we experienced rapid growth in revenues and in our business in and followed by a significant slowdown starting in that has placed  and may continue to place  a significant strain on our management and operations 
for example  our revenues increased to million in from million in yet revenues slowed to million in and million in our number of employees  excluding temporary employees  increased to at december  from at december  and the at december   but has decreased from at march  as a result of our historical growth  potential future growth  or slowdowns  we face several risks  including the following the need to improve our operational  financial  management  informational  and control systems  the need to hire  train  and retain highly skilled personnel in a market in which there may be severe shortages of these kinds of personnel  as we discuss below  and the challenge to manage expense reductions as rapidly as revenue slowdowns  without impacting development strategies 
we cannot ensure that we will be able to successfully manage growth or slowdowns profitably 

table of contents acquisitions we have acquired multiple companies and lines of business  and we may pursue additional acquisitions in the future 
these activities involve numerous risks  including the use of cash  acquired intangible assets  and the diversion of management attention 
we have acquired multiple companies and lines of business to date 
as a result of these acquisitions  we face numerous risks  including the following integrating the existing management  sales force  technicians  and other personnel into one culture and business  integrating manufacturing  administrative  and management information and other control systems into our existing systems  developing and implementing an integrated business strategy over what had previously been independent companies  developing compatible or complementary products and technologies from previously independent operations  and pre acquisition liabilities associated with the companies or intellectual property acquired  or both 
the risks stated above are made more difficult by most of the companies we have acquired being located outside of the united states 
in addition  if we make future acquisitions  these risks will be exacerbated by the need to integrate additional operations at a time when we may not have fully integrated all of our previous acquisitions 
if we pursue additional acquisitions  we will face similar risks as those outlined above and additional risks  including the following the diversion of our management s attention and the expense of identifying and pursuing suitable acquisition candidates  whether or not consummated  negotiating and closing these transactions  the potential need to fund these acquisitions by dilutive issuances of equity securities or by incurring debt  and the potential negative effect on our financial statements from an increase in other intangibles  write off of research and development costs  and high costs and expenses from completing acquisitions 
we cannot ensure that we will locate suitable acquisition candidates or that  if we do  we will be able to acquire them and then integrate them successfully and efficiently into our business 
competition competition could reduce our market share and decrease our net sales 
the market for our products is fragmented and intensely competitive  both inside and outside the united states  and is subject to rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  regulatory developments  and varied and changing customer preferences and requirements 
we compete with a number of united states and international suppliers that vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the products and services offered 
the following table sets forth our principal competitors in each of our product categories 
product category principal competitors wire line access acterna corporation  agilent technologies  inc fiber optics sonet sdh digital lightwave  inc  acterna corporation  agilent technologies  inc 
cable tv acterna corporation  agilent technologies  inc signaling inet technologies  inc  nettest 
table of contents many of these competitors have longer operating histories  larger installed customer bases  longer relationships with customers  wider name recognition and product offerings  and greater financial  technical  marketing  customer service  and other resources than we have 
we expect that as our industry and markets evolve new competitors or alliances among competitors with existing and new technologies may emerge and acquire significant market share 
we anticipate that competition in our markets will increase  and we will face greater threats to our market share and price pressure on our products 
also  over time  our profitability  if any  may decrease 
in addition  it is difficult to assess accurately the market share of our products or of sunrise overall because of the high degree of fragmentation in the market for service verification equipment 
as a result  it may be difficult for us to forecast accurately trends in the market  which of our products will be the most competitive over the longer term  and therefore  what is the best use of our cash and human and other forms of capital 
dependence on key employees if one or more of our senior managers were to leave  we could experience difficulty in replacing them and our operating results could suffer 
our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service and performance of a relatively small number of key senior management  technical  sales  and marketing personnel 
in particular  the loss of either of our two founders  paul ker chin chang or paul a 
marshall  would likely harm our business 
neither of these individuals is bound by an employment agreement with us  and we do not carry key man life insurance on them 
if any of our senior managers were to leave sunrise  we would need to devote substantial resources and management attention to replace them 
as a result  management attention may be diverted from managing our business  and we may need to pay higher compensation to replace these employees 
dependence on sole and single source suppliers because we depend on a limited number of suppliers and some sole and single source suppliers that are not bound by long term contracts  our future supply of parts is uncertain 
we purchase many key parts  such as microprocessors  field programmable gate arrays  bus interface chips  optical components  and oscillators  from a single source or sole suppliers  and we license certain software from third parties 
we rely exclusively on third party subcontractors to manufacture some sub assemblies  and we have retained  from time to time  third party design services in the development of our products 
we do not have long term supply agreements with these vendors 
in general  we make advance purchases of some products and components to ensure an adequate supply  particularly for products that require lead times of up to nine months to manufacture 
in the past  we have experienced supply problems as a result of financial or operating difficulties of our suppliers  shortages  and discontinuations resulting from component obsolescence or other shortages or allocations by suppliers 
our reliance on these third parties involves a number of risks  including the following the unavailability of critical products and components on a timely basis  on commercially reasonable terms  or at all  the unavailability of products or software licenses  resulting in the need to qualify new or alternative products or develop or license new software for our use and or to reconfigure our products and manufacturing process  each of which could be lengthy and expensive  the likelihood that  if these products are not available  we would suffer an interruption in the manufacture and shipment of our products until the products or alternatives become available  reduced control over product quality and cost  risks that are exacerbated by the need to respond  at times  to unanticipated changes and increases in customer orders  the unavailability of  or interruption in  access to some process technologies  and exposure to the financial problems and stability of our suppliers 

table of contents in addition  the purchase of these components on a sole source basis subjects us to risks of price increases and potential quality assurance problems 
this dependence magnifies the risk that we may not be able to ship our products on a timely basis to satisfy customers orders 
we cannot ensure that one or more of these factors will not cause delays or reductions in product shipments or increases in product costs  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business 
risks of international operations our plan to expand sales in international markets could lead to higher operating expenses and may subject us to unpredictable regulatory and political systems 
sales to customers located outside of the united states represented of our net sales in  in  and in  and we expect international revenues to continue to account for a significant percentage of net sales for the foreseeable future 
in addition  an important part of our strategy calls for further expansion into international markets 
as a result  we will face various risks relating to our international operations  including the following potentially higher operating expenses  resulting from the establishment of international offices  the hiring of additional personnel  and the localization and marketing of products for particular countries technologies  the need to establish relationships with government owned or subsidized telecommunications providers and with additional distributors  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and the risks of using hedging strategies to minimize our exposure to these fluctuations  which have been heightened by our acquisitions of pro 
tel  gie  and avantron  whose revenues have been and are likely to continue to be in euros and canadian dollars  respectively  potentially adverse tax consequences related to acquisitions and operations  including the ability to claim goodwill deductions and a foreign tax credit against us federal income taxes  especially since italy has a higher tax rate  and possible disruptions to our customers  sales channels  sources of supply  or production facilities due to wars  terrorist acts  acts of protest or civil disobedience  or other conflicts between or within various nations and due to variations in crime rates and the rule of law between nations 
we cannot ensure that one or more of these factors will not materially and adversely affect our ability to expand into international markets or our revenues and profits 
in addition  the asia pacific and latin america regions have experienced instability in many of their economies and significant devaluations in local currencies 
of our sales in  of our sales in  and of our sales in were from customers located in these regions 
these instabilities may continue or worsen  which could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations 
if international revenues are not adequate to offset the additional expense of expanding international operations  our future growth and profitability could suffer 
concentration of control our executive officers and directors retain significant control over us  which allows them to decide the outcome of matters submitted to stockholders for approval 
this influence may not be beneficial to all stockholders 
as of december   paul ker chin chang  paul a 
marshall  and robert c 
pfeiffer beneficially owned approximately   and  respectively  of our outstanding shares of common stock 
consequently  these three individuals  acting together  control approximately of our outstanding shares of common stock and are able to control the election of our directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions that must be submitted to a vote of stockholders 
in addition  mr 
chang  mr 
marshall  and mr 
pfeiffer constitute three of the six members of the board of directors and have significant influence in directing the actions taken by the board 
the interests of these 
table of contents persons may conflict with the interests of other stockholders  and the actions they take or approve may be contrary to those desired by other stockholders 
this concentration of ownership and control of the management and affairs of our company may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company that other stockholders may consider desirable 
potential product liability our products are complex  and our failure to detect errors and defects may subject us to costly repairs and product returns under warranty and product liability litigation 
our products are complex and may contain undetected defects or errors when first introduced or as enhancements are released 
these errors may occur despite our testing and may not be discovered until after a product has been shipped and used by our customers 
many of the products that we ship contain known imperfections that we consider to be insignificant at the time of shipment 
we may misjudge the seriousness of a product imperfection and allow it to be shipped to our customers 
these risks are compounded by the fact that we offer many products  with multiple hardware and software modifications  which makes it more difficult to ensure high standards of quality control in our manufacturing process 
the existence of these errors or defects could result in costly repairs and or returns of products under warranty and  more generally  in delayed market acceptance of the product or damage to our reputation and business 
in addition  the terms of our customer agreements and purchase orders which provide us with protection against unwarranted claims of product defect and error may not protect us adequately from unwarranted claims against us  unfair verdicts if a claim were to go to trial  settlement of these kinds of claims  or future regulation or laws regarding our products 
our defense against such claims in the future  regardless of their merit  could result in substantial expense to us  diversion of management time and attention  and damage to our business reputation and our ability to retain existing customers or attract new customers 
intellectual property risks policing any unauthorized use of our intellectual property by third parties and defending any intellectual property infringement claims against us could be expensive and disrupt our business 
our intellectual property and proprietary technology is an important part of our business  and we depend on the development and use of various forms of intellectual property and proprietary technology 
as a result  we are subject to several related risks  including the risks of unauthorized use of our intellectual property and the costs of protecting our intellectual property 
much of our intellectual property and proprietary technology is not protected by patents 
if unauthorized persons were to copy  obtain  or otherwise misappropriate our intellectual property or proprietary technology without our approval  the value of our investment in research and development would decline  our reputation and brand could be diminished  and we would likely suffer a decline in revenue 
we believe these risks  which are present in any business in which intellectual property and proprietary technology play an important role  are exacerbated by the difficulty in finding unauthorized use of intellectual property in our business  the increasing incidence of patent infringement in our industry in general  and the difficulty of enforcing intellectual property rights in some foreign countries 
in addition  litigation has in the past been  and may in the future be  necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights 
this kind of litigation is time consuming and expensive to prosecute or resolve  and results in substantial diversion of management resources 
we cannot ensure that we will be successful in that litigation  that our intellectual property rights will be held valid and enforceable in any litigation  or that we will otherwise be able to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology 

table of contents nasdaq continued listing requirements if our share price falls and remains below  we could be delisted from the nasdaq national market 
nasdaq marketplace rule a requires companies listed on the nasdaq national market to maintain a minimum bid price of 
recently  our common stock closed as low as on september  if the price of our common stock were to trade below for consecutive trading days  our common stock could be delisted from the nasdaq national market 
a delisting would impair our ability to raise additional working capital 
furthermore  because prices for delisted stocks are often not publicly available  a delisting would impair the liquidity of our common stock and make it difficult for you to sell your shares  and you may lose some or all of your investment 
anti takeover provisions anti takeover provisions in our charter documents could prevent or delay a change of control and  as a result  negatively impact our stockholders 
some provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of discouraging  delaying  or preventing a change in control of our company or unsolicited acquisition proposals that you  as a stockholder  may consider favorable 
these provisions provide for the following authorizing the issuance of blank check preferred stock  a classified board of directors with staggered  three year terms  prohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors  requiring super majority voting to effect certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation and by laws  limiting the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders  prohibiting stockholder action by written consent  and establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholders meetings 
some provisions of delaware law and our stock incentive plans may also have the effect of discouraging  delaying  or preventing a change in control of our company or unsolicited acquisition proposals 
these provisions also could limit the price that some investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we sell our products in north america  asia  latin america  africa  the middle east  and europe 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we have a small amount of sales denominated in euros and the canadian dollar and have at certain times used derivative financial instruments to hedge our foreign exchange risks 
as of december   we had no derivative financial instruments 
to date  foreign exchange risks from sales have not been material to our operations 
we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and changes in the market values of our investments 
our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we have not held derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we invest our excess cash in depository accounts with financial institutions  in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies  and in high quality corporate issuers  and  by policy  we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we protect and preserve our invested funds by limiting default  market  and reinvestment risk through portfolio diversification and review of the financial stability of the institutions with which we deposit funds and from whom we purchase debt instruments 

table of contents investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates  or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
because our investment policy restricts us to conservative  interest bearing investments and because our business strategy does not rely on generating material returns from our investment portfolio  we do not expect our market risk exposure on our investment portfolio to be material
