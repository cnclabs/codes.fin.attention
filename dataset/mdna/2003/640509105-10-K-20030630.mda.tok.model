overview neon develops  markets and supports software products for the ibm mainframe platform 
neon was incorporated in may and is a successor by merger to neon systems  inc  an illinois corporation  which was incorporated in june neon s primary product group  the shadow products  provide access and integration of ibm mainframe data and applications from standard application client environments  including the internet application platforms  and client server systems 
neon s product mix in the past three fiscal years has consisted of neon s shadow branded products  its iwave products  and the esm products owned by neon enterprise software  inc formerly peregrine bridge transfer corporation  hereafter nesi and distributed by neon 
over the last three fiscal years  neon s shadow products accounted for the majority of its sales mix  representing   and of neon s sales for fiscal   and  respectively 
during fiscal year  neon phased out its esm product line and iwave product line 
in august  neon terminated its distribution agreement with nesi  effectively exiting the esm market see management s discussion and analysis related party transactions and note to neon s consolidated financial statements 
on october   neon reduced the scope of its iwave operations and hired an investment advisor to assist neon in divesting its iwave product line 
on june   neon entered into an asset purchase agreement with a subsidiary of skywire ventures  llc  a dallas based software vendor  to sell the iwave product line assets 
see note to neon s consolidated financial statements 
neon derives revenue from software licenses and maintenance services 
license fees  which are based upon the number and capacity of servers as well as the number of client users  are generally due upon license grant and include a one year maintenance period 
the sales process typically takes approximately nine months 
after the initial year of license  neon provides ongoing maintenance services  which include technical support and product enhancements  for an annual fee 
any factors adversely affecting the pricing of  demand for  or market acceptance of  our products  such as competition or technological change  could materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
in fiscal   and  maintenance revenues represented   and of total revenues  respectively 
maintenance revenues are expected to continue to increase as a percentage of total revenues in the future 
during fiscal  neon did not have any customers that individually accounted for or more of total revenue 
in fiscal neon had one customer 
table of contents that accounted for of total revenue 
in fiscal  neon had one customer that represented of total revenue 
since its inception  neon has incurred substantial costs to develop our technology and products  to recruit and train personnel for our engineering  sales and marketing and technical support departments  and to establish an administrative organization 
accordingly  neon may need to increase its annual revenue to generate operating profits 
there can be no assurance in future quarters that neon will achieve or sustain revenue growth and or return to profitability 
as a result  management believes that its cash resources may decline as a result of continuing losses from operations and incremental costs associated with the financing and acquisition 
neon conducts its business in the united kingdom and germany through two wholly owned consolidated subsidiaries and revenues from these subsidiaries are denominated in local currencies 
in connection with these foreign operations  neon is exposed to foreign currency fluctuations for its net working capital positions 
at that date  neon had no material commitments that would be satisfied in currencies other than us dollars 
in other international markets  neon conducts substantially all of its business through independent third party distributors 
revenues derived from third party distributors are denominated in us dollars 
revenues recognized from sales to customers outside north america  primarily in europe  represented approximately  and in fiscal   and  respectively 
foreign currency fluctuations have not had a significant impact on neon s revenues or operating results 
management does not currently have an active foreign exchange hedging program  however  neon may implement a program to mitigate foreign currency transaction risk in the future 
in view of the rapidly changing nature of our business and the current weakness in the mainframe software market  neon believes that period to period comparisons of our revenue and operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of our future performance 
further  neon does not believe that its historical growth rates are necessarily representative of its future growth potential 
related party transactions members of neon s board of directors and certain current and former executive officers of neon are shareholders and or directors in other companies with which neon has business relationships 
see risk factors some members of our board of directors and management may have conflicts of interest and or are interested parties to certain transactions of neon 
transactions between neon and these other companies are described below 
neon enterprise software  inc formerly peregrine bridge transfer corporation in january  neon entered into a distribution agreement with peregrine bridge transfer corporation  a database software company whose sole stockholder is an affiliate of john j 
moores  neon s chairman of the board of directors 
pbtc subsequently changed its name to neon enterprise software  inc nesi 
the distribution agreement had an initial term through january  and could be automatically renewed for successive one year terms 
the agreement also provided that neon pay royalties to nesi for the license of products and for maintenance and support and upgrade services equal to of the revenues received by neon for neon s distribution of nesi s only products  its enterprise subsystem management products referred to elsewhere as the esm products 
neon also entered into a services agreement with nesi pursuant to which nesi reimbursed neon for nesi s share of the general and administrative expenses supplied to it by neon 
such amounts have historically been presented as a reduction of general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
neon revised the services agreement with nesi in october  as a result of which nesi s monthly payment to neon declined from  per month to  per month and neon s services were reduced 
in december  neon amended its distribution agreement with nesi and nesi granted neon an exclusive  worldwide license to market and sublicense nesi s esm products in exchange for neon s agreement to extend the term of the agreement through march  and pay nesi a minimum advance royalty of  per quarter during fiscal year   per quarter during fiscal year   per quarter during fiscal year  million per quarter during fiscal year  and million per quarter during fiscal year  for an aggregate payment of million 
such advance royalty 
table of contents payments have historically been recorded by neon as a prepaid expense and offset by of neon s sales of nesi products 
the amended distribution agreement also provided that nesi would reimburse neon for the amount of any unearned royalty advances when the agreement terminated in on june   the balance of the unearned advance payments was million  an increase of  from march  management believed that while the then current and reasonably foreseeable business prospects for revenue received by neon from licenses and maintenance for esm products was expected to be sufficient to offset the unearned advance royalty payments as of june   these revenues did not appear to be sufficient to meet the aggregate future minimum royalties required to be paid by neon to nesi over the term of the distribution agreement 
as a result  the balance of unearned advance royalty payments was projected to increase substantially by the time the distribution agreement would terminate on march  on june   nesi s sole source of income was the royalty payments made by neon and nesi had a substantial negative net worth 
as a result  neon s board had concerns regarding nesi s ability to repay any balance of unearned advances at the termination of the agreement in on july   the independent directors of neon authorized the officers of neon to review the distributor relationship with nesi and to negotiate a termination of the distribution agreement 
on july   the independent directors of neon approved a letter of intent with proposed terms for a termination of the distribution agreement  which letter of intent was executed by nesi and neon on such date 
pursuant to the provisions of the letter of intent and after the review and approval of the independent directors of neon and the ratification by the full board of directors on august   neon and nesi entered into a termination and customer support agreement dated august  pursuant to which the distribution agreement  the services agreement  and all other agreements between neon and nesi were terminated effective as of august  upon the closing of the termination and customer support agreement on august   nesi s right to receive from neon  and neon s corresponding obligation to pay to nesi  the advance royalty payments described in the distribution agreement terminated 
additionally  neon s option to purchase nesi and right of first refusal under the distribution agreement also terminated 
the termination and customer support agreement provides that  in consideration of nesi s consent to terminate its existing agreements with neon  neon paid nesi a final cash advance of million  which amount has been consolidated with  of the outstanding unearned royalty advance under the distribution agreement as of july  and the  payment with respect to the transfer of rights described below and represented by the consolidated promissory note payable to neon in the aggregate principal amount of million  bearing no interest to its due date of march  this consolidated promissory note is secured by all of the intellectual property of nesi nesi ip 
the termination and customer support agreement also provided that the remaining outstanding unearned royalty advance of million as of july  was converted into a million dollar convertible promissory note payable to neon bearing no interest to its due date of march   which is also secured by the nesi ip 
the million convertible note is convertible by neon  in its discretion  into equity in nesi at an agreed pre cash valuation of million dollars 
such conversion right will expire on the due date of the million convertible note 
upon closing  neon recorded the notes receivable from nesi at their estimated net present value  which was calculated at million in aggregate 
as a result of the termination agreement  neon recorded a loss on disposal of  neon also evaluates the nesi ip on a quarterly basis to determine the note s net realizable value  as it is secured by the nesi ip 
accordingly  neon will adjust the carrying value of the note if the net realizable value is determined to be below the carrying value 
after march   neon management had an external valuation of the note performed and determined that no further impairment of the note was required 
pursuant to the termination and customer support agreement and an assignment executed in connection with the closing of the termination and customer support agreement and effective as of august   nesi was assigned all of neon s rights and obligations under any customer license and maintenance agreements related to the nesi software products previously marketed by neon  including customer support obligations 
in 
table of contents addition  the terms of the termination and customer support agreement provide that nesi offered employment to certain sales and support personnel of neon that were assigned to market the esm software products 
the termination and customer support agreement also contemplated the resignation of wayne e 
webb jr 
as senior vice president and general counsel of neon effective as of august  to focus on his role as president and ceo of nesi 
at the closing of the termination and customer support agreement  skunkware  inc  nesi s sole stockholder  entered into a subordination agreement whereby all of the promissory notes described above from nesi to neon were made senior in priority to all other indebtedness from nesi to skunkware 
pursuant to the terms of the convertible promissory note and the consolidated promissory note  nesi has agreed to preserve and maintain the senior status of its indebtedness to neon and pursuant to the security agreement agreed to not issue any additional debt unless such debt does not encumber the nesi ip 
in further consideration of nesi entering into the termination and customer support agreement  neon agreed to provide nesi with administrative  accounting and legal services pursuant to the terms of a new services agreement 
such services will be provided by neon at no cost to nesi  other than reimbursement of reasonable business expenses  for the twelve month period beginning august  after the initial twelve month period of the services agreement  nesi may elect to receive the services  at its option  for up to an additional twelve months for a fee of  per month 
at the end of such additional term  or in the event nesi does not elect to continue receiving the services described above for the additional term  at the end of the initial term  neon shall have no further obligations under the services agreement 
additionally  in connection with the closing of the termination and customer support agreement on august   neon and nesi entered into a license and distribution agreement whereby nesi agreed to market and distribute neon s x software product 
the neon x software product was developed by nesi as an oem software product using the shadow source and object code under a remarketing agreement dated january  this remarketing agreement provided that neon would distribute the neon x software product under the terms of the distributor agreement 
finally  in connection with the closing of the termination and customer support agreement on august   neon and nesi entered into a trademark license agreement granting nesi a license to use the neon registered trademark in its marketing of neon x and the esm software products

woodhill  then chief executive officer of neon  was also a director  and the president and chief executive officer of scalable software 
in connection with the letter of intent  neon and scalable software entered into a promissory note dated july   which provided bridge financing to scalable in a maximum amount of million with a maturity date of december   secured by the personal guarantees of john j 
moores  louis r 
woodhill and jim woodhill 
on october   mr 
woodhill was asked to serve as the president and chief executive officer of neon 
on november   the promissory note was amended to increase the maximum lending limit to million with an original maturity date of march   with such increased amount also being guaranteed by messrs 
moores  woodhill and woodhill 
on december   louis r 
woodhill and his brother jim woodhill  were asked to join the board of directors of neon 
due to the interests in scalable software of several members of neon s board of directors  the board of directors concluded that it would be appropriate to create a special committee comprised solely of independent directors who had no interest in scalable software to review the terms of the proposed acquisition 
after thorough consideration and discussion and upon endorsement by the special committee  neon s board of directors approved modifications to the proposed terms and conditions for the acquisition such that the transaction would be structured as an option to acquire scalable software as discussed below 
neon obtained a two year option to acquire scalable software as outlined in the agreement and plan of merger dated june  in connection with this option  neon agreed to provide bridge financing of up to million  in addition to the million previously loaned to scalable software that is secured by personal guarantees from john j 
moores  louis r 
woodhill and jim woodhill 
the aggregate financing had a month term and does not bear interest during the term of the two year option to acquire scalable software 
after the expiration of the option  the loan will bear interest at the prime rate plus two percentage points 
in addition to the personal guarantees of john j 
moores  louis r 
woodhill and jim woodhill for the initial million loaned to scalable software  the million loan will be secured by all of the intellectual property rights of scalable software 
neon may exercise the option to acquire scalable software at any time during the two year term  subject to provisions that require neon to exercise its option within a day window under certain circumstances or forfeit the option 
if neon exercises the option and acquires scalable software  each of the approximately million outstanding shares of common stock of scalable software will be converted into approximately of a share of neon common stock and outstanding options and warrants to purchase approximately million shares of common stock of scalable software will become options and warrants to purchase common stock of neon on the same conversion basis 
if scalable software incurs more indebtedness for borrowed money or issues more equity  the exchange ratio will be adjusted accordingly 
prior to neon exercising the option to acquire scalable software  a special committee would be appointed to review the negotiated terms of the proposed acquisition and neon would seek to obtain a fairness opinion regarding the transaction from a financial advisory firm 
the acquisition of scalable software will also require approval of the stockholders of neon and the neon board of directors 

table of contents on october   the board of directors reviewed the progress of scalable software with respect to the timing of its anticipated break even quarter and determined that scalable software may require an additional infusion of at least  in additional capital to meet its projections 
in the interest of preserving neon s investment  the special committee approved an increase in the aggregate borrowing limit under the million loan to an aggregate principal amount of million  an increase of  in scalable software s aggregate borrowing limits under its line of credit with neon 
such increase was memorialized in an amendment to the relevant promissory notes and security agreements on december   and is subject in all respect to the current terms and conditions of the million loan 
it has previously been management s belief that scalable software may exhaust its line of credit from neon before it is able to generate cash from operations sufficient to sustain its operations 
as of the date of this filing  scalable has exhausted its credit facility with neon 
scalable has asked for and received waivers of neon s right of first refusal with respect to additional venture capital bridge financing from jmi services  inc and is currently pursuing a private placement of convertible preferred stock 
if scalable software is unable to secure such additional financing  it is management s belief that scalable software could become the subject of bankruptcy proceedings 
if scalable software is subject to bankruptcy proceedings  it is possible that the security interests held by neon in the intellectual property of scalable software might be set aside  and in such event neon could be treated as an unsecured creditor with respect to the million loan 
as noted above  certain current and former members of neon s board of directors and executive officers also serve or did serve as directors and executive officers of scalable software and claim beneficial ownership of approximately of scalable s common stock 
in addition  neon has an option to acquire all of the outstanding shares of scalable software and is scalable s primary creditor 
therefore  neon determined that it had effective control of scalable software while it was advancing funds to scalable and accounted for its investment in scalable software using the modified equity method of accounting 
under this method of accounting  neon recognized of scalable software s losses to the extent of advances made in excess of the guaranteed amount 
as of march   neon had made total advances of million to scalable software including million of unguaranteed advances and recognized cumulative losses of million  of which million were recorded during fiscal as neon does not currently intend to advance any additional funds to scalable at this time  we do not currently foresee the recognition of any additional losses attributable to scalable software 
due to the uncertainties regarding neon s ultimate ability to recover any unguaranteed advances to scalable software  neon has decided not to record the carrying value of its net advance to scalable software above the guaranteed amount 
accordingly  for fiscal  neon recorded a valuation allowance of  against the scalable note receivable  reducing the carrying value of the note receivable to the million guaranteed amount 
sheer genius software  inc on january   neon entered into a services agreement with sheer genius software  inc of austin  texas  a company owned by jim woodhill 
jim woodhill was a member of neon s board of directors at such time 
also  jmi services  inc  a private company owned by john j 
moores  neon s chairman  is a creditor of sheer genius 
under the first project description negotiated for such services agreement  sheer genius provided development services to neon on a budgeted time and materials basis and delivered fixed deliverables consisting primarily of developed source code 
the term of the initial project description was six months and the aggregate fees were  this agreement was extended by the board for an additional three months with additional aggregate fees of  on october   the board determined that the services agreement with sheer genius should be extended on a month to month basis 
on may   neon terminated the agreement with sheer genius and will continue such development efforts internally 
all fees under the arrangement were expensed as incurred and included in research and development 
while neon was sheer genius sole source of income  it was free to solicit other customers 
under the services agreement  all intellectual property created by sheer genius in the course of performing the services is owned by neon 
sheer genius received a license back of such intellectual property for limited use in the development by sheer genius of software that does not compete with software distributed by neon 
the board of directors reviewed the 
table of contents terms of the services agreement and project description and approved such agreements following disclosure of the interest of its officers and directors associated with sheer genius 
for the year ended march   neon paid  to sheer genius software for services fees 
as of the date of termination of the services agreement with sheer genius  neon had paid services fees in aggregate amount of million 
critical accounting policies the following is a discussion of the accounting policies that neon believes are most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations and require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition policies statement of position  software revenue recognition sop  was issued in october by the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa and was amended by statement of position sop and statement of position sop 
neon adopted sop effective july   sop effective march  and sop effective april  neon believes its current revenue recognition policies and practices are consistent with sop  sop and sop revenues from software license sales are recognized when all of the following conditions are met a non cancelable license agreement has been signed  the product has been delivered  there are no material uncertainties regarding customer acceptance  collection of the receivable is probable  no other significant vendor obligations exist  and vendor specific objective evidence exists to allocate the total fee to elements of the arrangement 
vendor specific objective evidence is based on the price generally charged when an element is sold separately 
all elements of each order are valued at the time of revenue recognition 
license revenues generally include software maintenance agreements for the first year following the date of sale 
in such cases  revenues are allocated between licenses fees and maintenance revenues based on vendor specific objective evidence 
revenues from first year maintenance agreements and separately priced software maintenance agreements for subsequent years are deferred and recognized ratably on a straight line basis over the maintenance period 
neon also markets and sells its products through independent distributors and resellers 
license and maintenance revenues from these transactions are recognized when sold to the ultimate end user and all of the above conditions are met 
capitalized software costs neon follows sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed 
research and development expenditures have been charged to operations as incurred 
no such costs have been capitalized to date 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable as a part of its normal accounting procedures  neon evaluates outstanding accounts receivable to estimate whether they will be collected 
this is a subjective process that involves making judgments about our customers ability and willingness to pay these accounts 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded as an offset to accounts receivable in order to present a net balance that we believe will be collected 
in estimating the appropriate balance for this allowance  we consider specific reserves for accounts we believe may prove to be uncollectible and additional reserves  based on historical collections  for the remainder of our accounts 
additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts are charged to operating expenses  and deductions from the allowance are recorded when specific accounts receivable are written off as uncollectible 
if neon s estimate of uncollectible accounts should prove to be inaccurate at some future date  the results of operations for the period could be materially affected by any necessary correction to the allowance for doubtful accounts 

table of contents deferred income taxes neon records deferred income tax assets and liabilities on its balance sheet related to events that impact its financial statements and tax returns in different periods 
in order to compute these deferred tax balances  neon first analyzes the differences between the book basis and tax basis of its assets and liabilities referred to as temporary differences 
these temporary differences are then multiplied by current tax rates to arrive at the balances for the deferred income tax assets and liabilities 
if deferred tax assets exceed deferred tax liabilities  neon must estimate whether those net deferred asset amounts will be realized in the future 
a valuation allowance is then provided for the net deferred asset amounts that are not likely to be realized 
the change in neon s net deferred income tax balances during a period results in a deferred income tax provision or benefit in its statement of operations 
if neon s expectations about the future tax consequences of past events should prove to be inaccurate  the balances of its deferred income tax assets and liabilities could require significant adjustments in future periods 
such adjustments could cause a material effect on neon s results of operations for the period of the adjustment 
accounting for advances to scalable software as discussed more fully in related party transactions above  certain members of neon s board of directors and executive officers also serve as directors and executive officers of scalable software and claim beneficial ownership of approximately of scalable s common stock 
in addition  neon has an option to acquire all of the outstanding shares of scalable software and during fiscal year provided scalable s primary financing for its operations 
therefore  neon determined that it has effective control of scalable software and began accounting for its investment in scalable software using the modified equity method of accounting 
under this method of accounting  neon recognizes of scalable software s losses to the extent of its advances made to scalable software in excess of the amounts guaranteed by messrs

cost of license revenues was million  million  and million  in fiscal  and  respectively  representing   and of total license revenues in the respective periods 
the fiscal reduction in cost of license revenues was primarily due to lower product royalty payments associated with the termination of the nesi distribution agreement in august see related party transactions and note to neon s consolidated financial statements 
the increase in fiscal was due to greater royalty payments to nesi as a result of increased sales of the esm products 
cost of licenses increased as a percentage of license revenue during fiscal as neon s esm products accounted for a greater percentage of the sales mix in fiscal than in fiscal cost of maintenance revenues includes personnel and other customer support costs

sales and marketing expenses were million  million  and million in fiscal  and  respectively  representing  and of total revenue in the respective periods 
the reduction in sales and marketing expenses in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to lower personnel costs associated with headcount reductions during fiscal  combined with lower promotional marketing costs  as neon reduced the scope of its iwave product operations and exited the esm market 
the decline in sales and marketing in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to decreases in travel costs and marketing activities such as trade shows and advertisements as well as decreased commissions related to lower sales 
research and development expenses primarily include personnel costs associated with neon s product development staff 
research and development expenses were million  million  and million in fiscal  and  respectively  representing  and of total revenues in each of the respective periods

general and administrative expenses include personnel and other costs associated with neon s executive  financial  legal and administrative functions 
general and administrative expenses were million  million  and million excluding million from nonrecurring charges during fiscal in fiscal  and  respectively  representing   and of total revenues of the respective periods 
the increase in general and administrative expenses from fiscal to fiscal is primarily due to a  
table of contents nonrecurring charge related to excess depreciation expense incurred as a result of a change in the estimated lives of certain fixed assets 
the nonrecurring charges in fiscal consisted of million for charges related to the departure of certain executives  a  charge for the cost of strategic consulting projects and a  realized foreign currency loss 
the dollar increase from fiscal to fiscal  excluding nonrecurring charges  is primarily from increases in office occupancy costs  related office expansion expenses and increases in personnel costs 
during the year ended march   neon incurred restructuring charges of million 
the charges primarily relate to future losses due to the abandonment of leased facilities associated with a corporate reorganization as well as severance and non cash stock compensation costs related with the termination of the distribution agreement with nesi 
the company has not been able to sublease the abandoned facilities and therefore  has accrued the full amount of the future lease commitments 
if the company is able to sublease these facilities in the future  it may result in a reversal of this accrual 
during fiscal  neon recorded a restructuring charge of  these charges related to reductions in the company s cost structure and corporate reorganization  including reductions in force resulting in severance charges of  and losses from lease commitments of  due to the abandonment of certain leased facilities 
during fiscal  neon performed impairment tests on its intangible assets related to the intellectual property acquired from sterling software in october iwave ip and the goodwill related to the september acquisition of beyond software  inc bsi 
as a result  neon recorded impairment charges of million during the year

 neon tested the goodwill balances associated with the september acquisition of bsi for impairment by comparing the fair value of bsi to its carrying value 
fair value was determined after considering changes in operational strategies and plans  as well as assumptions regarding the potential future cash flows from the acquired assets
