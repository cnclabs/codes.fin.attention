all of these forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the relevant forward looking statement

the forward looking statements included in this annual report are made only as of the date of this annual report and we undertake no obligation to publicly update these forward looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances 
the following presentation of management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a premier executive recruitment firm with the broadest global presence in the recruitment industry 
our services include executive recruitment  middle management recruitment through futurestep  strategic management assessment and executive coaching 
we have approximately executive recruitment consultants and futurestep consultants based in nearly cities across countries 
our clients are many of the world s largest and most prestigious public and private companies  middle market and emerging growth companies as well as government and not for profit organizations 
over half of the executive recruitment searches we performed in fiscal were for board level  chief executive and other senior executive positions and our  
table of contents clients included approximately of the fortune companies 
we have established strong client loyalty  more than of the executive recruitment assignments we performed in fiscal were on behalf of clients for whom we had conducted multiple assignments over the last three fiscal years 
based on deteriorating economic conditions in the beginning of fiscal  we began developing a series of restructuring initiatives  to address our cost structure and to reposition ourselves to gain market share and take advantage of the eventual economic recovery 
our immediate goals were to reduce losses  preserve our top producers and maintain our high standards of client service 
in august  we announced the first of these business realignment initiatives 
these initiatives reduced the workforce by approximately  or over employees 
such initiatives included consolidating back office functions for futurestep and executive recruitment  exiting the college recruitment market  and the write off of other related assets and goodwill 
these restructuring initiatives resulted in a total charge of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
in june  we announced that we will continue to streamline our infrastructure and improve overall organization efficiencies 
near term activities will focus on the consolidation of futurestep back office functions  reduction of corporate and administrative overhead  and other adjustments to our cost base 
as such  we expect to incur a charge of approximately million to million in the fiscal first quarter of which the majority will be in cash 
in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued topic no 
d  income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred that requires presentation of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses as revenue and the related expenses as expense in the statement of operations 
this topic issued as emerging issues task force issue no 
eitf no 
 is effective for reporting periods beginning after december  and requires prior period results to be reclassified to conform to the new presentation 
we implemented this guidance effective may  accordingly  prior year results reflect the reclassification of out of pocket expenses  primarily candidate travel expenses  previously reported as a reduction in revenue  to expense 
there was no impact on operating income  net income  eps or cash flow as a result of the reclassification 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  effective for fiscal years ending after december  this rule amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide several alternatives for adopting the stock option expense provisions of sfas no 
 as well as additional required interim financial statement disclosures 
sfas no 
does not require companies to expense stock options in current earnings 
we have not adopted the provisions of sfas no 
for expensing stock based compensation  however  we will adopt the additional interim disclosure provisions of sfas in the current year  we have presented our segment operating results to reflect our business segments without allocations of corporate overhead 
this presentation represents how management internally evaluates the operating performance of our business segments and gives a more meaningful picture of our business units performance 
accordingly  prior year operating results have been reclassified to reflect segment results on the same basis 
critical accounting policies the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and operating results are based on our consolidated financial statements 
preparation of this annual report on form k requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions 
in preparing our financial statements and accounting for the underlying transactions and balances  we apply our accounting policies as 
table of contents disclosed in our consolidated financial statements 
we consider the policies discussed below as critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management s judgment 
specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs 
senior management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition 
management is required to establish policies and procedures to ensure that revenue is recorded for valid engagements  over the performance period and related costs are matched against such revenue 
we provide recruitment services on a retained basis and generally bill clients in three monthly installments 
since the search is generally not contingent upon placement of a candidate  our assumptions primarily relate to establishing the period over which such service is performed 
these assumptions determine the timing of revenue recognition and profitability for the reported period 
if these assumptions do not accurately reflect the period over which revenue is earned  revenue and profit could differ 
deferred compensation 
deferred compensation requires assumptions regarding participant data and discount rate that can significantly impact the liability and related cost on our balance sheet and statement of operations 
management engages an actuary to review these assumptions to ensure that they reflect the population and economics of our deferred compensation plans in all material respects 
the actuarial assumptions we use may differ from actual results due to changing market conditions or changes in the participant population 
these differences could have a significant impact on our costs and liability 
carrying values 
valuations are required under us generally accepted accounting principles to determine the carrying value of various assets 
our most significant assets that require management to prepare or obtain valuations are goodwill and deferred income taxes 
management must identify whether events have occurred that may impact the carrying value of these assets and make assumptions regarding future events  such as profitability 
differences between the assumptions used to prepare these valuations and actual results could materially impact the carrying amount of these assets and net income loss 
results of operations the following table summarizes the results of our operations as a percentage of fee revenue fiscal year ended april  fee revenue compensation and benefits general and administrative expenses out of pocket engagement expenses depreciation and amortization asset impairment and restructuring charges operating income loss net income loss excluding asset impairment and restructuring charges in fiscal and and  for comparability under sfas no

on this same basis  net income loss as a percentage of fee revenue is  and for the fiscal years ended april   and  respectively

goodwill amortization was million in fiscal the company presents these amounts as alternative measures to the actual amounts 
the company uses these amounts to analyze its operating results since it believes that asset impairment and restructuring charges and goodwill amortization do not reflect  and make it difficult to compare  the company s ongoing operations year over year 
b in the current year  we have presented the segment operating results to reflect our business segments without allocations of corporate overhead 
accordingly  we have reclassified prior year operating results to reflect our segment operating results on the same basis

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a result of our global operating activities  we are exposed to certain market risks  including foreign currency exchange fluctuations  fluctuations in interest rates and variability in interest rate spread relationships 
we manage our exposure to these risks in the normal course of our business as described below 
we have not utilized financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes nor do we trade in derivative financial instruments 
foreign currency risk generally  financial results of our foreign subsidiaries are measured in their local currencies 
assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars at the rates of exchange in effect at the end of each year and revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange during the year 
resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of comprehensive income 

table of contents financial results of foreign subsidiaries in countries with highly inflationary economies are measured in us dollars 
the financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated using a combination of current and historical rates of exchange and any translation adjustments are included in determining net income 
historically  we have not realized any significant translation gains or losses on transactions involving us dollars and other currencies 
this is primarily due to natural hedges of revenue and expenses in the functional currencies of the countries in which our offices are located and investment of excess cash balances in us dollar denominated accounts 
in fiscal  and  we recognized foreign currency gains losses  after income taxes  of million  million and million  respectively  primarily related to our europe operations 
realization of translation gains or losses due to the translation of inter company payables denominated in us dollars is mitigated through the timing of repayment of these inter company borrowings 
interest rate risk we primarily manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates through our regular financing activities that generally are short term and provide for variable market rates 
as of april   we had no outstanding balance on our credit facility 
we have million of borrowings against the cash surrender value of coli contracts as of april  bearing interest primarily at variable rates payable at least annually 
we have notes payable due to shareholders of million resulting from business acquisitions in fiscal and  at rates ranging from to 
in june  we issued million of convertible debt and million of convertible preferred stock that is mandatorily redeemable by us if outstanding on june  the convertible debt approximates fair value at april
