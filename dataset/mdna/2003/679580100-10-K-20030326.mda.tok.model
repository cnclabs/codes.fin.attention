item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading less than truckload multi regional motor carrier providing one to four day service among five regions in the united states and next day and second day service within these regions 
through our four branded product groups  od domestic  od global  od expedited and od technology  we offer an array of innovative products and services that provide direct service to states within the southeast  south central  northeast  midwest and west regions of the country  including states within which we provide full state coverage 
in addition  through marketing and carrier relationships  we provide service to and from the remaining states  as well as canada  mexico and the caribbean 
our non union workforce operates a fleet of more than  tractors and more than  trailers 
historically  over of our revenue is derived from transporting ltl shipments for our customers  whose demand for our services is generally tied to the health of the overall economy 
the majority of direct costs associated with our business are driver and service center wages and benefits  operating supplies and expenses  and depreciation of our equipment fleet and service center facilities 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the years indicated  expenses and other items as a percentage of revenue from operations revenue from operations salaries  wages and benefits purchased transportation operating supplies and expenses depreciation and amortization building and office equipment rents operating taxes and licenses insurance and claims communication and utilities general supplies and expenses miscellaneous expenses  net total operating expenses operating income interest expense  net other income expense  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income compared to in  we achieved double digit revenue growth  improved our operating efficiencies and increased our earnings at a faster rate than revenue growth 
we achieved these objectives  even while the us economy remained sluggish throughout the year  primarily by implementing our strategy of growing revenue in our existing areas of operation and improving asset utilization 
revenue for increased to  compared to  in our operating ratio  a measure of profitability calculated by dividing operating costs by revenue  improved to from  and net income improved to  for  or over net income for of  our revenue growth strategy was based upon increasing market share through improved service products  faster transit times and expanded coverage 
consistent with these objectives  we announced full state coverage for the state of new hampshire in june  bringing the number of states in which we provide coverage to while expansion plans are closely tied to the strength of the national economy  we seek to produce long term profitable growth by positioning ourselves to expand significantly in stronger economic times and avoiding the risk of overextending ourselves in weaker economic cycles 
revenue growth in was driven by an increase in the number of shipments handled coupled with a 
increase in revenue per shipment 
the improvement in revenue per shipment resulted from a increase in revenue per hundredweight  partially offset by a decrease in weight per shipment 
the improvement in revenue per hundredweight in was due more to a increase in our average length of haul than to our ability to raise rates or maintain pricing  particularly in the first half of the year 
our average length of haul increased to miles in from miles in a portion of our revenue growth in the second half of the year can be attributed to the increase in freight volume associated with the september  bankruptcy of consolidated freightways  a major national ltl carrier with annual revenues of billion in and one of our competitors 
while we experienced a increase in shipments and a 
decrease in revenue per shipment in the first half of the year  we gained a significant amount of momentum in the second half of the year as reflected by a increase in shipments and a improvement in revenue per shipment 
we believe this reduction in industry capacity  will continue to provide an opportunity for us to expand our customer base  improve market share and provide for a more favorable pricing environment for all ltl carriers 
we also benefited from a full year of revenue and increased market share generated by the additional service centers we opened in our south central area on february   when we acquired certain assets of carter sons freightways of carrollton  texas 
we anticipate these markets will continue to mature and be a source of growth in as a result of our market share improvements throughout our service center network  tonnage increased in over  enabling us to obtain certain economies of scale as we moved greater concentrations of shipments through our existing route structure and service center network 
as a result  our incremental costs associated with this added volume were generally lower as reflected by the improvement in our operating ratio 
salaries  wages and employee benefit expenses  the largest component of our cost structure  were of revenue in compared to in most of these costs were incurred as variable driver and platform labor directly associated with the movement of shipments through our network 
our driver and platform wages  excluding benefit expenses  were of revenue in compared to for the cost of providing group health benefits to our employees and their families decreased to of revenue in from in after experiencing a increase in these costs in  primarily due to significant increases in the cost of our prescription drug benefit  we identified cost savings opportunities that were implemented in january these changes were instrumental in reducing the rate of increase in our group health costs in purchased transportation expenses  which includes lease operator costs  purchased linehaul  local transportation services and equipment rentals  decreased to of revenue in from in when there are capacity restraints within our fleet or when it is economically beneficial  we purchase transportation services for our linehaul and local pickup and delivery operations from lease operators  other motor carriers and rail providers 
in  lease operator expenses decreased from of revenue to  purchased linehaul services increased to 
of revenue from  and purchased pickup and delivery services decreased to from 
equipment rentals decreased from 
of revenue to 
from the prior year 
as we continue to expand our services and geographic coverage  we intend to decrease our use of purchased transportation and increase the utilization of our employees and equipment 
fuel costs  including fuel taxes  decreased to of revenue in from in our general tariffs and contracts generally include provisions for a fuel surcharge  recorded in net revenue  which have effectively offset significant diesel fuel price fluctuations 
these surcharges decrease or are eliminated as fuel prices approach certain floor levels 
the adoption of statements of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on january  resulted in a decrease in amortization expenses of  in in addition  we also increased our asset utilization as more tonnage moved through our service center network 
as a result  depreciation and amortization expense dropped to of revenue in from for the prior year 
insurance and claims expense increased to of revenue in from in on april   we renewed many of our major insurance policies at significantly higher renewal rates  even after substantially increasing our self insured retention levels 
these higher rates resulted from overall increases in insurance markets  which affect the entire transportation industry  rather than our specific loss experience 
long term debt  including current maturities  decreased to  at december  compared to  at year end while debt levels were higher throughout the first months of  we used  of the net  in proceeds from our underwritten public offering of stock completed in november to repay all indebtedness under our revolving line of credit and retire a senior note 
although our debt levels were higher in  our weighted average interest rate on outstanding debt was lower  resulting in a decrease in interest expense to of revenue from in we capitalized  in interest charges in compared to  in the effective tax rate for both and was 
compared to while the trucking industry experienced lower demand for transportation products  we continued to implement our long term strategy to increase market share through improved service products and selective geographic expansion 
on february   we purchased selected assets of carter sons freightways  inc of carrollton  texas 
carter sons operated a regional less that truckload network of service centers  primarily in texas and surrounding states 
as a result  we opened new service centers and merged the remaining service centers into our existing operations 
this acquisition allowed us to expand our full state coverage to states and enhanced our regional and inter regional markets in the continental united states 
we estimate that the acquisition generated approximately  of additional revenue in a weak national economy  compounded by the terrorist attacks on september   impacted our ability to reach our financial performance goals for while revenue grew to  or over  increases in operating costs outpaced revenue growth and resulted in a decline in net income to  compared to  in diluted earnings per share for the year was compared to  a decrease of 
our operating ratio for  a measure of profitability calculated by dividing operating costs by revenue  increased to from in although total tonnage decreased 
in when compared with  ltl tonnage shipments weighing less than  lbs 
increased 
because ltl shipments generally are priced at higher revenue per hundredweight  our revenues increased while tonnage decreased 
net revenue per hundredweight was compared to for the prior year  an increase of 
we operated service centers at year end compared to service centers in these additional service centers required us to increase our tractor and trailer fleet by and  respectively 
increases in the number of service centers and the equipment fleet  combined with relatively flat tonnage between and  generated excess capacity and a resulting increase in depreciation and amortization expense to of revenue from for linehaul driver pay increased to of revenue from in  a result of an increase in intercity miles driven without a comparable increase in revenue per mile 
intercity miles increased while revenue per intercity mile decreased  an indication that linehaul density declined between the two periods 
we self insure a significant portion of the group health benefits we provide for our employees and their families 
these costs increased or  over the prior year and significantly contributed to the increase in our operating ratio 
in anticipation of continued increases in health care costs  consistent with national trends  we implemented cost savings initiatives in january to offset a portion of these costs 
fuel expense decreased to of revenue from in our general tariffs and contracts generally include provisions for a fuel surcharge  recorded in net revenue  which has effectively offset significant diesel fuel price fluctuations 
we seek to apply these surcharges until prices fall below certain floor levels 
results for also include the sale and disposition of land and structures  which included both operating and non operating properties 
operating properties were sold for gains before taxes totaling  and were recorded in miscellaneous expenses  net 
other income expense  net included the sale and disposal of non operating assets for a net gain before taxes of  as a result of a higher average level of debt outstanding during  interest expense increased to of revenue from 
outstanding debt was  at december  compared to  at december   an increase of 
this increase in debt is primarily due to increased working capital requirements and to additional financing required to fund  of net capital expenditures in we capitalized  in interest charges in compared to  in the tax rate for both and was 
liquidity and capital resources expansion in both the size and number of service center facilities  the planned tractor and trailer replacement cycle and revenue growth have required continued investment in real estate and equipment 
in order to support these requirements  we incurred net capital expenditures of  during cash flows generated internally funded of the capital expenditures for the year  while the remainder was funded by proceeds received through a stock offering completed in november at december   long term debt including current maturities decreased to  from  at december  we estimate net capital expenditures to be approximately  to  for the year ending december  of that  approximately  is allocated for the purchase of tractors and trailers   is allocated for the purchase or construction of larger replacement service centers or expansion of existing service centers   is allocated for investments in technology and the balance is allocated for other assets 
we plan to fund these capital expenditures primarily through cash flows from operations supplemented by the remaining proceeds from our november stock offering and additional borrowings 
the table below sets forth our capital expenditures for the years ended december   and  excluding assets acquired as part of business acquisitions year ended december  in thousands land and structures tractors trailers technology other total on may   we entered into an uncollateralized committed credit facility with wachovia bank  national association formerly first union national bank  which  as amended  consists of a  line of credit and a  line to support standby letters of credit 
this facility has a term of three years that expires on may   and we are currently negotiating the renewal of this credit agreement 
interest on the line of credit is charged at rates that vary in a range of libor plus 
to  based upon a fixed charge coverage ratio 
the applicable interest rate for under this agreement was based upon libor plus 
to 
a fee ranging from 
to 
was charged on the unused portion of the line of credit  and fees ranging between 
to 
were charged on outstanding standby letters of credit 
standby letters of credit are primarily issued as collateral for self insured retention reserves for bodily injury  property damage and workers compensation claims 
at december   there were no amounts outstanding on the line of credit and  outstanding on the standby letter of credit facility 
we have four individual senior note agreements outstanding totaling  at december  these notes call for periodic principal and interest payments with maturities ranging from through  of which  is due in interest rates on these notes are fixed and range from to 
under the provisions of one of these notes  we may issue up to  of additional senior notes 
the applicable interest rate and payment schedules for any new notes will be determined and mutually agreed upon at the time of issuance 
our senior notes and credit agreement limit the amount of dividends that may be paid to shareholders pursuant to certain financial ratios 
at december   our debt instruments limited the amount of dividends that could be paid to shareholders to  we did not declare or pay a dividend on our common stock in and we have no plans to declare or pay a dividend in with the exception of the line of credit  interest rates are fixed on all of our debt instruments 
therefore  short term exposure to fluctuations in interest rates is limited to our line of credit facility  which had no outstanding balance at december  we do not currently use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
also  we do not use fuel hedging instruments  as our tariff provisions generally allow for fuel surcharges to be implemented in the event that fuel prices exceed stipulated levels 
in november  we issued and sold in an underwritten public offering  shares of common stock in exchange for net proceeds of  we used  of the total proceeds to repay all indebtedness outstanding under our committed credit facility 
we used  to repay a maturing senior note issued in  which bears a interest rate and matured on december  the balance of the proceeds will be used to fund scheduled debt payments in  fund the scheduled replacement cycle of our existing equipment  which consists primarily of tractors and trailers  and to fund our growth strategy  which includes the purchase and expansion of service centers 
a significant decrease in demand for our services could limit our ability to generate cash flow and affect profitability 
most of our debt agreements have covenants that require stated levels of financial performance  which if not achieved could cause acceleration of the payment schedules 
we do not anticipate a significant decline in business levels or financial performance  and we believe the combination of our existing credit facilities along with our additional borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet seasonal and long term capital needs 
the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total less than months months months over months long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases amount of commitment expiration per period in thousands other commercial commitments total amounts committed less than months months months over months standby letters of credit contractual obligations include long term debt consisting primarily of senior notes totaling  capital lease obligations for tractors  trailers and computer equipment  and off balance sheet operating leases primarily consisting of real estate leases 
other commercial commitments consist of standby letters of credit used as collateral for self insured retention of insurance claims 
critical accounting policies in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we apply the following critical accounting policies that affect judgments and estimates of amounts recorded in certain assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses revenue and expense recognition operating revenue is recognized on a percentage of completion method based on average transit time 
expenses associated with operating revenue are recognized when incurred 
allowance for uncollectible accounts we maintain an allowance for uncollectible accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
claims and insurance accruals claims and insurance accruals reflect the estimated ultimate total cost of claims  including amounts for claims incurred but not reported  for cargo loss and damage  bodily injury and property damage  workers compensation  long term disability and group health not covered by insurance 
these costs are charged to insurance and claims expense except for workers compensation  long term disability and group health  which are charged to employee benefits expense 
from april  through march   we were self insured for bodily injury and property damage claims up to  per occurrence 
cargo claims were self insured up to  however  after the first two losses exceeded  in the policy year  the retention under our excess insurance policy was reduced to  per occurrence 
we were also self insured for workers compensation in certain states and had first dollar or high deductible plans in the remaining states 
due to recent losses incurred by the insurance industry  rates offered by insurers for many types of coverage have significantly increased over the prior year renewal rates 
as a result  we determined that additional risk in the form of higher retention levels was warranted  and  effective april   self insured retention for bodily injury and property damage increased to  per claim while the self insured retention for cargo claims increased to  per claim 
this combination of increased premiums and additional reserve requirements for self insurance caused insurance expense to increase to of operating revenue in from in the previous year 
in establishing accruals for claims and insurance expenses  we evaluate and monitor each claim individually  and we use factors such as historical experience  known trends and third party estimates to determine the appropriate reserves for potential liability 
we believe the assumptions and methods used to estimate these liabilities are reasonable  however  changes in the severity of previously reported claims  significant changes in the medical costs and legislative changes affecting the administration of our plans could significantly impact the determination of appropriate reserves in future periods 
goodwill the excess cost over net assets acquired in connection with acquisitions is recorded in other assets 
we adopted statements of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas on january  and completed the required analyses of the fair value of our single reporting unit compared to the carrying value as of january  and october  based on those analyses  we concluded that there was no impairment of these assets  which totaled  at year end prior to the adoption of sfas  these intangible assets were amortized using a straight line method over their estimated useful lives of three to years 
at december   goodwill totaled  which included  of accumulated amortization 
property and equipment property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight line basis over their estimated economic lives 
management uses historical experience  certain assumptions and estimates in determining the economic life of each asset 
periodically  we review property and equipment for impairment to include changes in operational and market conditions  and we adjust the carrying value and economic life of any impaired asset as appropriate 
currently  estimated economic lives for structures are five to years  revenue equipment is two to years  other equipment is two to years  and leasehold improvements are the lesser of years or the life of the lease 
the use of different assumptions  estimates or significant changes in the resale market for our equipment could result in material changes in the carrying value of our assets 
inflation most of our expenses are affected by inflation  which generally results in increased operating costs 
in response to fluctuations in the cost of petroleum products  particularly diesel fuel  we have implemented a fuel surcharge in our tariffs and contractual agreements 
the fuel surcharge is designed to offset the cost of fuel above a base price and increases as fuel prices escalate over the base 
for  the net effect of inflation on our results of operations was minimal

since  leasing and we have combined our requirements for the purchase of tractors  trailers  equipment  parts  tires and fuel 
we believe that  by combining our requirements  we are often able to obtain pricing discounts because of the increased level of purchasing 
while this is beneficial to us  our management believes that the termination of this relationship would not have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
for the years ended december   and  we charged leasing   and  respectively  for vehicle repair  maintenance and other services  which we provide to leasing at cost 
in addition  we charged leasing  annually in  and  for rental of a vehicle maintenance facility located in chesapeake  virginia
