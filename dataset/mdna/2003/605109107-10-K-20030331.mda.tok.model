item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mission is an independent oil and gas exploration and production company 
we acquire  develop and produce crude oil and natural gas 
our balanced property portfolio is comprised of long lived  low risk assets  like those in the permian basin  and multi reservoir  high productivity assets found along the gulf coast and in the gulf of mexico 
our operational focus is on property enhancement through exploitation and development drilling  low to moderate risk exploration  asset redeployment and operating cost reduction and acquisitions when the opportunities are suitable 
our primary business objective is to create value through expanding reserves and production that  in turn  results in per share increases in net asset value  cash flow and earnings 
financing activities our outstanding indebtedness totaled million at december  the entire amount was attributable to the senior subordinated notes due in we also had million available for borrowing under a revolving credit facility at december  on may   bellwether merged with bargo and changed its name to mission resources corporation 
at that time  we increased our authorized capital stock to million shares of common stock and million shares of preferred stock  and amended the stock incentive plan to increase the number of shares reserved for issuance under the plan by million shares 
under the merger agreement  holders of bargo s stock and options received a combination of cash and mission common stock 
we used the purchase method to account for the merger 
the merger was financed through the issuance of million in mission common stock to bargo option holders and shareholders  and an initial draw down under a credit facility of million 
the funds from the credit facility were used to 
refinance bargo s and bellwether s then existing credit facilities 

pay the cash portion of the purchase price of the bargo common stock and options  and 
fund bargo s redemption its preferred stock immediately prior to the merger 
mission issued million of additional senior subordinated notes on may  and used most of the net proceeds of the bond issuance to reduce existing borrowings under the credit facility 
senior subordinated notes in april  we issued million of senior subordinated notes due on may   we issued an additional million of senior subordinated notes due  with identical terms to the notes issued in april  at a premium of million that is shown separately on the balance sheet 
we amortize the premium as a reduction of interest expense over the life of the notes so that the effective interest rate on these additional notes is 
through december   we had amortized approximately  of the premium 
interest on the notes is payable semi annually on april st and october st 
we believe that we have sufficient liquidity provided by cash flows from operations  to pay the interest due on the notes 
we may choose to redeem the notes  in whole or in part  at any time after april  at plus accrued and unpaid interest 
the redemption price decreases annually to on april  should control of mission change  as defined in the note indenture  the note holders could require us to purchase from them all or part of the notes for plus accrued and unpaid interest 
the notes contain covenants that 
limit indebtedness and liens  
require compliance with covenants of existing debt such as our credit facility  
limit dividend payments and repurchases of capital stock  
restrict payments to subsidiaries defined by the indenture as restricted subsidiaries  
control issuance and sales of stock of restricted subsidiaries  
restrict the disposition of proceeds from asset sales  and 
restrict mergers and consolidations or sales of assets 
we were in compliance with the covenants of the notes at december  and are currently in compliance 
the notes require us to comply with covenants of other existing debt if borrowings under that debt exceed million 
because our credit facility had no balance at december  and we do not expect to exceed million of borrowing under this facility in the first quarter of  any potential for non compliance with its covenants will not impact our compliance with the covenants of our notes 
standard and poor s and moody s publish debt ratings for mission 
their ratings consider a number of items including  but not limited to  our debt levels  planned asset sales  near term and long term production growth opportunities  capital allocation challenges and commodity price levels 
at december   our standard poor s corporate bond rating was b and our moody s rating was caa  negative outlook 
a decline in our ratings would not create a default or other unfavorable change in the notes and credit facility 
credit facility mission is party to a million credit facility with a syndicate of lenders 
the credit facility is a revolving facility  expiring may   which allows mission to borrow  repay and re borrow under the facility from time to time 
the total amount that we may borrow is called our borrowing base 
the lenders periodically set the borrowing base based upon their consideration of our oil and gas reserves or other factors they deem relevant 
at december   our borrowing base was million 
the credit facility was recently amended on october   reducing the maximum amount available under the credit facility from million to million 
this modification does not limit the rights of the parties to initiate interim borrowing base redeterminations in accordance with the credit facility 
as a result of the reduction in our borrowing capacity   of previously capitalized deferred financing costs was charged to interest expense 
we paid interest on the credit facility borrowings during at an average interest rate of 
for future borrowings  we may elect to apply an annual interest rate on credit facility borrowings equal to either 
the eurodollar rate  plus an applicable margin ranging from to  or 
the greater of i the prime rate  as determined by chase manhattan bank  or ii the federal funds rate plus  plus a maximum of 
the applicable margin for interest is based on our outstanding borrowings as a percentage of the borrowing base  and our long term debt rating as published by standard poor s or moody s 
we also pay commitment fees on funds available under the borrowing base and fees on outstanding letters of credit 
commitment fees range from to on the unused portion of the credit facility 
letter of credit fees range from to of the unused portion of the million letter of credit sub facility 
commitment fees and letter of credit fees under the credit facility are based on our utilization rate and long term debt rating 
the credit facility contains negative covenants that limit our ability  among other things  to 
incur additional debt  
pay dividends on stock  redeem stock or redeem subordinated debt  
make investments  
create liens in favor of senior subordinated debt and subordinated debt  
sell assets  
sell capital stock of subsidiaries  
guarantee other indebtedness  
enter into agreements that restrict dividends from subsidiaries  
merge or consolidate  and 
enter into transaction with affiliates 
in addition  the credit facility requires that we maintain certain financial covenants 
a minimum interest coverage ratio of earnings before interest  depreciation  depletion  amortization  income tax  and extraordinary items  or ebitdax  to interest expense fiscal quarter interest coverage ratio through to through to through to through to and thereafter 
to 
an asset coverage or current ratio which includes availability of at least to  
a maximum ratio of senior debt to ebitdax of to  and 
a maximum ratio of total debt to ebitdax fiscal quarter total debt to ebitdax through to through to through to through to through to and thereafter 
to we had no outstanding borrowings under the credit facility and were in compliance with its covenants on december  at current oil and gas price levels  we expect to be in compliance with all of the credit facility covenants throughout declining commodity prices or rising expenses could prevent us from meeting the credit facility covenants 
in that event  we would attempt to negotiate an amendment or a waiver of the covenants from our lenders 
should the lenders fail to approve our requests  then we would attempt to obtain the funds to repay the outstanding credit facility debt through property sales or equity financing 
we cannot assure you that we would be successful in completing any of these possible actions 
capital structure we have a highly leveraged capital structure  limiting our financial flexibility 
in particular  we must pay approximately million of interest annually on the notes  which limits the amount of cash provided by operations that is available for exploration and development of oil and gas properties 
the notes also contain various covenants that limit our ability to  among other things  incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends  purchase capital stock and sell assets 
in addition  our common stock is trading at historically low levels  which limits our ability to complete offerings of equity securities 
because of these issues  our new management team has reviewed various alternatives to restructure the company and has retained the investment banking firm of petrie parkman co 
to assist in this evaluation 
among the alternatives being considered are 
a refinancing of the notes  
a new credit facility  
a merger with or an acquisition by another company  
the sale of certain oil and gas properties  
the acquisition by the company of another company or assets  
the addition of other secured and unsecured debt financings  and 
the issuance of equity securities or other debt securities for cash or properties or in exchange for the notes 
some of these alternatives would require approval of our shareholders  and all of them will require the approval of other parties to the transaction 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in completing any of these possible transactions 
liquidity and capital resources mission s principal sources of capital for the last three years have been  cash flow from operations  debt sources such as the issuance of bonds or bank credit facility borrowings  the issuance of common stock  and the sale of properties 
our primary uses of capital have been the funding of exploration and development projects and property acquisitions 
source of capital operations cash flow provided by operating activities  which is calculated after taking into account changes in working capital  totaled million  million and million for the fiscal years   and  respectively 
our operating cash flow is sensitive to many variables  with prices of oil  natural gas and ngl being the most volatile 
prices are determined primarily by prevailing market conditions 
regional and worldwide economic growth  weather and other variable factors influence market conditions 
we are not able to control these factors and may not be able to accurately predict prices 
to mitigate some of the risk inherent in oil and natural gas prices  we hedge our oil and natural gas production by entering into commodity price swaps or collars designed to set minimum and or maximum prices on a portion of our production 
our policy is to hedge a percentage of proved producing production for the current year and the two following years 
we mitigate  but do not eliminate the potential negative effect of declining prices on operating cash flow because these hedges remove the price volatility from some of our oil and natural gas production 
hedging also prevents us from receiving the full advantage of increases in oil or gas prices above the fixed amount specified in the hedge 
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for a more detailed discussion of commodity price risk and a listing of our current hedges 
source of capital debt our outstanding balance under the senior subordinated notes was million at december  and and was million at the end of no credit facility borrowings were outstanding at december  borrowings under our credit facility were million and million at the end of and  respectively 
at december   million was available for borrowing under the credit facility 
as previously discussed under financing activities  both our notes and our credit facility contain covenants limiting our activities or requiring that we maintain specific financial ratios 
as of december   we were in compliance with all applicable covenants 
declining commodity prices or rising expenses could prevent us from meeting the credit facility covenants 
in that event  we would attempt to negotiate an amendment or a waiver of the covenants from our lenders 
should the lenders fail to approve our requests  then we would attempt to obtain the funds to repay the outstanding credit facility debt through property sales or equity financing 
we cannot assure you that we would be successful in completing any of these possible actions 
source of capital issuance of common stock we issued million shares of common stock on may  to holders of bargo stock and options in order to effect the merger 
simultaneously with the merger  mission s authorized capital stock was increased to million shares of common stock and million shares of preferred stock 
source of capital sale of properties we continue to evaluate and assess our property portfolio and capital needs  and we may from time to time sell certain properties as appropriate 
net proceeds from the sale of domestic oil and gas properties were approximately million in  million in and million in net proceeds are gross proceeds adjusted for transaction costs and interim operations 
we also sold our ecuadorian interests for approximately million in june and our snyder and diamond m gas plant interests for million in late use of capital exploration and development mission s expenditures for exploration  including land and seismic costs  and development of its domestic oil and gas properties totaled million  million and million  for the fiscal years  and  respectively 
we also spent million in the year and million in the year on development of the charapa and tiguino fields in ecuador 
our capital budget for totals approximately million  with million for exploration  million for development  and million for seismic data  land and related items 
if commodity prices continue at the current level  the capital expenditure budget will increase 
our plan is to budget capital expenditures up to discretionary cash flows 
this capital budget represents the largest planned use of our available operating cash flow 
we believe that working capital and operating cash flow will be sufficient to meet the exploration and development plans detailed in the budget 
to a certain degree  the ultimate timing of these capital expenditures is within our control 
use of capital acquisitions we did not make any significant acquisitions during the year the merger with bargo  valued at million  was the most significant acquisition of our other domestic property acquisitions totaled million in the year and million in the year additionally  we spent  in the year and million in the year to acquire an interest in the tiguino field in ecuador 
the field was subsequently sold in june we continuously review acquisition opportunities and would first consider whether operating cash flows were adequate to make a desired acquisition 
for larger acquisitions  we would drawdown on our credit facility or would attempt to issue equity securities  however  we cannot assure you that either of these sources would be able to provide funds adequate to complete all desired acquisitions 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments mission is required to make future payments under contractual obligations 
the following table details those payments amounts in thousands contractual cash obligations total thereafter long term debt       operating leases  total contractual obligations       includes bond principal of million scheduled for repayment in and bond interest accrued monthly and payable april st and october st of each year

 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  we identified those policies of particular importance to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and those policies that require our management to apply significant judgment 
we believe these critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
full cost method of accounting for oil and gas assets we use the full cost method of accounting for investments in oil and gas properties 
under the full cost method of accounting  all costs of acquisition  exploration and development of oil and gas reserves are capitalized as incurred into a full cost pool 
under the full cost method  a portion of employee related costs may be capitalized in the full cost pool if they are directly identified with acquisition  exploration and development activities 
generally  salaries and benefits are allocated based upon time spent on projects 
amounts capitalized can be significant when exploration and major development activities increase 
we deplete the capitalized costs in the full cost pool  plus estimated future expenditures to develop and abandon reserves  using the units of production method based upon the ratio of current production to total proved reserves 
depletion is a significant component of our net income 
proportionally  it represented over of our total revenues in the year and approximately of total revenues in the years and any reduction in proved reserves without a corresponding reduction in capitalized costs will increase the depletion rate 
both the volume of proved reserves and the estimated future expenditures used for the depletion calculation are obtained from the reserve estimates prepared by independent reservoir engineers 
these reserve estimates are inherently imprecise as they rely upon both the engineers quantitative and subjective analysis of various data  such as engineering data  production trends and forecasts  estimated future spending and the timing of spending 
different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserves based on the same data 
finally  estimated production costs and commodity prices are added to the assessment in order to determine whether the estimated reserves have any value 
reserves that cannot be produced and sold at a profit are not included in the estimated total proved reserves  therefore the quantity of reserves can increase or decrease as oil and gas prices change 
see risk factors risks related to our business  industry and strategy for general cautions concerning the reliability of reserve and future net revenue estimates by reservoir engineers 
the full cost method requires a quarterly calculation of a limitation on capitalized costs  often referred to as a full cost ceiling calculation 
the ceiling is the discounted present value of our estimated total proved reserves adjusted for taxes  using a discount rate 
to the extent that our capitalized costs net of depreciation  depletion  amortization  and deferred taxes exceed the ceiling  the excess must be written off to expense 
once incurred  the impairment of oil and gas properties is not reversible at a later date even if oil and gas prices increase 
we recorded a ceiling impairment of million  pre tax  in  but will not require an impairment for the year while the difficulty in estimating proved reserves could cause the likelihood of a ceiling impairment to be difficult to predict  the impact of changes in oil and gas prices is most significant 
in general  the ceiling is lower when prices are lower 
oil and gas prices at the end of the period are applied to the estimated reserves  then costs are deducted to arrive at future net revenues  which are then discounted at to arrive at the discounted present value of proved reserves 
additionally  we adjust the estimated future revenues for the impact of our existing cash flow commodity hedges 
the ceiling calculation dictates that prices and costs in effect as of the last day of the period are generally held constant indefinitely 
therefore  the future net revenues associated with the estimated proved reserves are not based on mission s assessment of future prices or costs  but rather are based on prices and costs in effect as of the end the period 
because the ceiling calculation dictates that prices in effect as of the last day of the period be held constant  the resulting value is rarely indicative of the true fair value of our reserves 
oil and natural gas prices have historically been variable and  on any particular day at the end of a period  can be either substantially higher or lower than our long term price forecast  which we feel is more indicative of our reserve value 
you should not view full cost ceiling impairments caused by fluctuating prices  as opposed to reductions in reserve volumes  as an absolute indicator of a reduction in the ultimate value of our reserves 
derivative instruments accounting all of our commodity derivative instruments represent hedges of the price of future oil and natural gas production 
we estimate the fair values of our hedges at the end of each reporting period 
the estimated fair values of our commodity derivative instruments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet as assets or liabilities as appropriate 
at december   they represented a million current liability and a  long term liability 
for effective hedges  we record the change in the fair value of the hedge instruments to other comprehensive income  a component of stockholders equity  until the hedged oil or natural gas quantities are produced 
any ineffectiveness of our hedges  which could represent either gains or losses  would be reported when calculated as an adjustment of interest and other income 
estimating the fair values of commodity hedge derivatives requires complex calculations  including the use of a discounted cash flow technique and our subjective judgment in selecting an appropriate discount rate 
in addition  the calculation uses future nymex prices  which although posted for trading purposes  are merely the market consensus of forecast price trends 
the results of our fair value calculation cannot be expected to represent exactly the fair value of our commodity hedges 
in the past we have chosen to obtain the fair value of commodity derivatives from the counter parties to those contracts 
since the counter parties are market makers  they were able to provide us with a literal market value  or what they would be willing to settle such contracts for as of the given date 
we currently use a software product from an outside vendor to calculate the fair value of our hedges 
this vendor provides the necessary nymex futures prices and the calculated volatility in those prices to us daily 
the software is programmed to apply a consistent discounted cash flow technique  using these variables and a discount rate derived from prevailing interest rates 
this software is successfully used by several of our peers 
its methods are in compliance with the requirements of sfas no 
and have been reviewed by a national accounting firm 
our existing commodity hedges are perfectly effective 
should circumstances change  all or part of the hedges could become ineffective 
we would be required to record an income impact at that time 
for example  should we fail to produce oil and gas in amounts adequate to cover the hedges  the derivative would immediately be considered speculative and its entire change in value would be recorded as either a gain or loss in interest and other income 
thereafter  the derivative would be marked to market each quarter  substantially increasing the volatility of our earnings 
business combinations and goodwill recent accounting pronouncements prescribe that all future acquisitions will be accounted for using the purchase method 
under the purchase method  the acquiring company adds to its balance sheet the estimated fair values of the acquired company s assets and liabilities 
any excess of the purchase price over the fair values of the tangible and intangible net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
also under recent accounting pronouncements  goodwill with an indefinite useful life is no longer amortized  but instead is assessed for impairment at least annually 
corporate acquisitions  or mergers  have contributed significantly to mission s growth 
the merger with bargo in was the most significant 
we consider similar transactions to be a viable way to continue mission s growth 
application of the purchase method of accounting requires us to estimate the fair value of every asset and liability  both tangible and intangible  which are acquired in a merger or corporate acquisition 
we make various assumptions and estimates in arriving at those fair values 
for example  current assets and liabilities are assumed to be at fair value 
the most significant assets to be valued are the proved oil and gas properties 
this valuation requires an estimate of proved reserves and future net revenues 
we hire independent reservoir engineers to provide the estimated volume of proved reserves 
the difficulties and risk of inaccuracies associated with these estimated proved reserves have been described earlier in this section under full cost method of accounting for oil and gas assets and in the risk factors section 
where the full cost ceiling test requires the use of end of period prices to calculate future net revenues  we are allowed to select prices that we feel are more likely to be realized when attempting to value the reserves of an acquisition candidate 
we could use flat  escalating or variable future prices in the valuation 
in order to make the fair value assessment as objective as possible  we typically use future price forecasts  such as the nymex futures  adjusted to the wellhead by known price differentials  that are posted and accessible to the public 
these prices are applied to the estimated proved reserves to arrive at estimates of future net revenues 
future net revenues are then discounted at the rate we feel is appropriate  generally our required rate of return on projects or an industry standard given existing market conditions  to arrive at the estimated fair value of proved reserves 
we apply these same general principles in arriving at the fair value of unproved reserves acquired in a business combination 
these unproved reserves are generally classified as either probable or possible reserves 
independent reservoir engineers may provide estimates of probable and possible reserves 
because of their very nature  probable and possible reserve estimates are more imprecise than those of proved reserves 
to compensate for the inherent risk of estimating and valuing unproved properties  we reduce the discounted future net revenues of probable and possible reserves by what we consider to be an appropriate risk weighting factor for each particular instance 
the probable or possible reserves are reviewed on an individual field basis to determine the appropriate risk weighting factor for each field 
the risk weighting factor can therefore differ substantially by field  depending upon the determinations of our engineers and geologists 
our merger with bargo created goodwill 
the annual test for goodwill impairment requires some of the same valuation steps  and therefore the same types of estimates and management judgment  as the valuation of an acquired company 
mission designated december st as the date for its annual test 
based upon such test for  goodwill should be fully impaired 
the valuation was based on the following procedures and information 
compute a cash flow model of mission s oil and gas assets using third party information and verification  
apply risking parameters to the various categories of oil and gas reserves using reputable third party sources for risk profile  
apply a discount rate to such valuation that approximates mission s cost of capital and cost of debt  
reduce this valuation by mission s net debt to ascertain the equity fair value  and 
compare book equity to fair value equity 
this calculation resulted in an equity fair value below book equity plus goodwill 
this means that the entire amount of goodwill is impaired 
if goodwill is created through any future merger or corporate acquisition  the annual impairment test of goodwill would be similar 
revenue recognition mission records revenues from sales of crude oil and natural gas when delivery to the customer has occurred and title has transferred 
this occurs when production has been delivered to a pipeline or a tanker lifting has occurred 
we may share ownership with other producers in certain properties 
in this case  we use the sales method to account for sales of production 
it is customary in the industry for various working interest partners to sell more or less than their entitled share of natural gas production  creating gas imbalances 
under the sales method  gas sales are recorded when revenue checks are received or are receivable on the accrual basis 
typically no provision is made on the balance sheet to account for potential amounts due to or from mission related to gas imbalances 
if the gas reserves attributable to a property have depleted to the point that there are insufficient reserves to satisfy existing imbalance positions  a liability or a receivable  as appropriate  should be recorded equal to the net value of the imbalance 
as of december   we have recorded a net liability of approximately  representing approximately  mcf at an average price of per mcf  related to imbalances on properties at or nearing depletion 
we value gas imbalances using the price at which the imbalance originated if stated in the gas balancing agreement or we use the current price where there is no gas balancing agreement available 
reserve reductions on any fields that have imbalances could change this liability 
we do not anticipate the settlement of gas imbalances to adversely impact our financial condition in the future 
settlements are typically negotiated  so the per mcf price for which imbalances are settled could differ among wells and even among owners in one well 
asset retirement  impairment or disposal we are adopting sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations effective january  currently our estimate of future plugging and abandonment and dismantlement costs is charged to income by being included in the capitalized costs that we deplete using the unit of production method 
sfas no 
requires us to record a liability for the fair value of our estimated asset retirement obligation  primarily comprised of our plugging and abandonment liabilities  in the period in which it is incurred 
upon initial implementation  we must estimate asset retirement costs for all of our assets as of today  inflation adjust today s costs to the forecast abandonment date  discount that amount back to the date we acquired the asset and record an asset retirement liability in that amount with a corresponding addition to our asset value 
then we must compute all depletion previously taken on future plugging and abandonment costs  and reverse that depletion 
finally  we must accrete the liability to present day 
any income effect of this initial implementation will be reflected as a change in accounting method on our statement of operations 
after initial implementation  we will reduce the liability as abandonment costs are incurred 
should actual costs differ from the estimate  the difference will be reflected as an abandonment gain or loss in the statement of operations when the abandonment occurs 
we are also developing a process through which to track and monitor the obligations for each asset 
as with previously discussed estimates  the estimation of our asset retirement obligation is dependent upon many variables 
we attempt to limit impact of management s subjective judgment on these variables by using the input of qualified third parties when possible 
we engaged an independent engineering firm to evaluate our properties and to provide us with estimates of abandonment costs 
we used the remaining estimated useful life from the year end netherland  sewell associates  inc reserve report in estimating when abandonment could be expected 
the resulting estimate  after application of a discount factor and some significant calculations  could differ from actual results  despite all our efforts to make the most accurate estimation possible

oil and gas revenues oil and gas revenues  were million in the year ended december   compared to million for the respective period in this represents a decrease in revenues 
oil revenues oil revenues decreased slightly to million for the year from million for the year the absence of revenues from ecuadorian oil accounts for the majority of the decrease in oil revenues 
we sold our interests in the ecuador fields in june gas revenues gas revenues decreased from million in to million in average realized gas prices  including hedge impact  were down from per mcf in the year ended december  gas production declined compared to the previous year with  mmcf and  mmcf in the years and  respectively 
the production decline was expected and is primarily related to our sale of additional properties throughout the year  downtime offshore and along the gulf coast during september and october when hurricanes passed through  and the consistent production decline of our offshore properties 
hedges the realized prices discussed above include the impact of oil and gas hedges 
a decrease of  related to hedge activity was reflected in oil and gas revenues for the year  while a decrease in oil and gas revenues of million was reflected for the previous year 
ecuadorian oil production in was not hedged 
interest and other income interest and other income decreased million from a net gain of million reported for the year to a net loss of million reported for the year a million loss from hedge ineffectiveness  as computed under the requirements of sfas 
no 
 was recorded in this line item for the year a net gain from hedge ineffectiveness of million was recorded in a million gain resulting from the settlement of the royalty calculation dispute with the mms was also recorded in lease operating expenses total lease operating expenses for the year were million compared to million in the year  a decrease of million 
ecuadorian operations  which were sold in june  accounted for million in the year on a barrel equivalency basis  domestic lease operating expenses were per boe in and per boe in costs for the properties acquired in the merger with bargo and the june south louisiana acquisition were included in lease operating expenses for the full year 
many of these properties are higher fixed costs properties 
our production declines in other areas have contributed to the increased operating expenses on a boe basis 
taxes other than income production taxes  ad valorem taxes and franchise taxes are included in this amount 
production taxes are calculated as a percentage of revenue in many areas  therefore  they vary with both price and production levels 
ad valorem taxes are assessed based upon property value each year 
the most significant contribution to increased ad valorem taxes is the merger with bargo and the acquisition of south louisiana properties in because a full year s ad valorem taxes was recognized on those properties in transportation costs transportation costs represent those expenses incurred to bring production to sale points such as pipeline fees and gas gathering fees 
in  we were responsible for paying transportation for more of our oil and gas sales 
in  the purchaser  torch  assumed responsibility for transportation costs on the gas it purchased from us 
depreciation  depletion and amortization depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a of domestic properties decreased from million in to million in on a per boe basis  dd a increased  from in to in  reflecting decreases in reserves as a result of property sales and revisions 
depletion of the ecuadorian full cost pool for was  the ecuadorian properties were sold in june impairment expense the impairment expense in of million is the result of the impairment of goodwill 
the impairment expense reported in consists of a million full cost ceiling impairment  the write off of a million long term receivable and a  charge for exploration stage mining activities 
both the goodwill and the full cost ceiling impairment are discussed in detail under critical accounting policies 
the long term receivable represented a production payment due from a foreign energy company 
management determined that the receivable was uncollectible in the fourth quarter of loss on sale of assets the loss on sale of assets of million in is primarily attributable to the post closing settlement on the sale of our ecuadorian interests 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses totaled million in the year ended december  as compared to million in the year ended december   for a decrease of 
severance costs were million in compared with million of severance and outsourcing contract termination fees in additionally  salaries and benefits were million lower in than in  as a result of staff reductions in early the termination of outsourcing contracts reduced management fees by million in income taxes the benefit for federal and state income taxes for the year ended december  was based upon a effective tax rate 
the million valuation allowance on deferred taxes applicable at december  has been increased to million at december   because we have determined that the portion of deferred tax asset relating to state tax losses generated during the period would not be realized 
in assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
based upon the projection for future state taxable income  management believes it is more likely than not that we will not realize its deferred tax asset related to state income taxes 
interest expense interest expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  approximately million of the increase is related to the additional months that the million of senior subordinated notes were outstanding and accruing interest during the increase is partially offset by the change in the fair value of mission s interest rate swap  reported as a reduction of interest expense in both years 
the net gain from the change in fair value was million in and  in year ended compared to year ended net income net loss for the year ended december  was million  or per share on a diluted basis  while net income for the year ended december  was million  or per share on a diluted basis 
oil and gas revenues oil and gas revenues  were million in the year ended december   compared to million for the respective period in this represents a increase 
oil revenues total oil revenues increased to million for the year from million for the year domestic oil revenues benefited from a increase in realized oil prices from in to in and a increase in domestic oil production from mmbbls in to mmbbls in the improved domestic oil production was directly related to acquisitions made in  particularly the raccoon bend  wasson  levelland and east texas fields acquired in the bargo merger 
a decrease in ecuadorian oil revenues of occurred because the fields were sold at mid year and realized oil prices declined 
ecuadorian oil production was  barrels  sold at  for the year compared to  barrels  sold at for the year gas revenues gas revenues decreased from million in to million in average realized gas prices  including hedge impact  increased from per mcf in the year ended december  to per mcf in the year ended december  gas production declined compared to the previous year with  mmcf and  mmcf in the years and  respectively 
this decline reflected the effects of the sale of short life gas properties in hedges the realized prices discussed above include the impact of oil and gas hedges 
a decrease of million related to hedge activity was reflected in oil and gas revenues for the year  while a decrease in oil and gas revenues of million was reflected for the previous year 
ecuadorian oil production was not hedged 
gas plant revenues gas plant revenues were million in compared to million in contributing to this decrease was an decline in average realized plant liquid prices 
also  only months of snyder gas plant operations and months of diamond m gas plant operations were reported in because the plants were sold during the year 
interest and other income interest and other income increased from  reported for the year to million reported for the year the primary reason for this increase is the inclusion of non cash hedge ineffectiveness  as computed under the requirements of sfas 
no 
 in this line item 
a net gain from hedge ineffectiveness of million was recorded in two legal settlements totaling  and the write off of million of various receivables in partially offset the favorable impact of hedge ineffectiveness in there were no legal settlements in and  of receivables were written off in lease operating expenses total lease operating expenses for the year were million compared to million in the year on a barrel equivalency basis  domestic lease operating expenses were per boe in and per boe in  increasing from million in to million in as a result of the bargo merger and the south louisiana property acquisition  there are more wells to operate and many are oil wells that tend to be higher cost 
additionally  third party oilfield service costs rose in response to record commodity prices at the beginning of after the bargo merger  we reviewed our properties for cost saving opportunities 
some of these opportunities required initial spending in the form of workovers or acceleration of maintenance and repair projects in order for future operations to benefit 
ecuadorian operations  which were sold in june  accounted for million of total lease operating expenses in the year and million in the year taxes other than income production taxes  ad valorem taxes and franchise taxes are included in this amount 
production taxes are calculated as a percentage of revenue in many areas  therefore  they vary with both price and production levels 
while production taxes increased on an absolute basis  they remained essentially the same on a per boe basis in both years 
ad valorem taxes are assessed based upon property value each year 
the most significant contribution to increased taxes is the acquisition of properties  however only one half year of additional ad valorem taxes was included in for the acquired properties because they were acquired at mid year 
gas plant expenses gas plant expenses decreased from million in to million in the year the decrease was related to the reduction in gas purchase costs 
also  only months of snyder gas plant operations and months of diamond m gas plant operations were reported in because the plants were sold within the year 
transportation costs transportation costs represent those expenses incurred to bring production to sale points such as pipeline fees and gas gathering fees 
the increase in was primarily attributable to the properties acquired in the bargo merger  including raccoon bend 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a of domestic properties increased from million in to million in on a per boe basis  dd a increased  from in to in  reflecting increased future development costs associated with new reserves 
depletion of the ecuadorian full cost pool for was  compared to  in the ecuadorian properties were sold in june impairment expense the impairment expense reported in consists of a million full cost ceiling impairment  the write off a million long term receivable  and a  charge for exploratory stage mining activities 
the full cost ceiling impairment is discussed in detail under critical accounting policies full cost method of accounting for oil and gas assets 
the long term receivable represented a production payment due from a foreign energy company 
management determined that the receivable was uncollectible in the fourth quarter of uncollectible gas revenues mission wrote off as uncollectible a million receivable from a subsidiary of enron corp 
as a result of the bankruptcy filing of enron 
loss on sale of assets the loss on sale of assets consists of a million loss on the sale of our ecuadorian interests  which was offset by a million gain on the sale of the snyder and diamond m gas plants 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses totaled million in the year ended december  as compared to million in the year ended december   for an increase of 
salaries and benefits increased million in over levels as a result of our increased employee count after the bargo merger 
also the costs of steps to reduce future costs  including one time charge of million related to staff reductions and  related to the termination of outsourcing contracts  contributed to the increase 
income taxes at december   we determined that it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized based on current projections of taxable income due to higher commodity prices at year end  and the valuation allowance was decreased by million to zero 
at december   however  we determined that a portion of the deferred tax assets would not be realized 
in assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
based upon the projections for future state taxable income  management believes it is more likely than not that we will not realize the deferred tax asset related to state income taxes 
based upon the projections of future taxable income  management believes it is more likely than not that we will not realize our deferred tax asset related to the impairment of the production payment  as the reversal of the deferred tax asset will result in a capital loss for federal income tax purposes  and we do not project any transactions resulting in capital gains to offset the capital loss 
therefore  the valuation allowance was increased by million for the year ending december  interest expense interest expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  increased borrowings under the credit facility in due to the bargo merger and the additional million of senior subordinated notes issued in may contributed to the expense increase 
additionally  a net gain from the change in fair value of mission s interest rate swap was reported as a reduction of interest expense 
cumulative effect of change in accounting method the adoption of sfas no 
at january  resulted in the recognition of a non cash million loss  net of taxes  representing the cumulative effect of a change in accounting method related to an interest rate swap that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment

the liability is accreted at the end of each period through charges to operating expense 
the amount of the asset retirement obligation is added to the carrying amount of the oil and gas properties and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the properties 
if the obligation is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability  we will recognize a gain or loss on settlement 
we are required and plan to adopt the provisions of statement no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk mission is exposed to market risk  including adverse changes in commodity prices and interest rates 
to the extent that we use derivative instruments to mitigate these risks  we are also exposed to credit risk 
commodity price risk mission produces and sells crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids 
as a result  our operating results can be significantly affected by fluctuations in commodity prices caused by changing market forces 
we periodically seek to reduce our exposure to price volatility by hedging a portion of production through swaps  options and other commodity derivative instruments 
a combination of options  structured as a collar  is our preferred hedge instrument because there are no up front costs and protection is given against low prices 
these collars assure that the nymex prices we receive on the hedged production will be no lower than the price floor and no higher than the price ceiling 
recent oil hedges placed in periods of high oil prices were swaps that fix the price to be received 
our realized price for natural gas per mcf is generally less than the nymex mmbtu price 
our realized price for oil is generally per bbl less than nymex 
realized prices differ from nymex due to factors such as the location of the property  the heating content of natural gas and the quality of oil 
the oil differential excludes the impact of point pedernales field production for which our selling price is capped at per bbl 
the point pedernales field was sold in march to the operator 
in may several existing oil collars were cancelled 
new swaps and collars hedging forecast oil production were acquired 
we paid approximately million  the fair value of the previous oil price collars at that time  to counter parties in order to cancel the transactions 
by removing the price volatility from hedged volumes of oil and natural gas production  we have mitigated  but not eliminated  the potential negative effect of declining prices on our operating cash flow 
the potential for increased operating cash flow due to increasing prices has also been reduced 
if all our commodity hedges were to settle at december  prices  our cash flows would decrease by million  however the actual settlement of our hedges will increase or decrease cash flows over the period of the hedges at varying prices

  collar credit risk these commodity hedges expose mission to counter party credit risk to the extent the counter party is unable to meet its monthly settlement commitment to us 
we believe that we select creditworthy counter parties to our hedge transactions 
each of our counter parties have long term senior unsecured debt ratings of at least a a by standard poor s or moody s 
interest rate risk we may also enter into financial instruments such as interest rate swaps to manage the impact of interest rates 
effective september   we entered into an eight and one half year interest rate swap agreement with a notional value of million 
under the agreement  mission received a fixed interest rate and paid a floating interest rate 
this agreement did not qualify for hedge accounting 
it was marked to market each quarter 
at december   the fair value was reported as a million liability on the balance sheet 
in february  we cancelled this swap by paying the counter party approximately million  the fair value of the swap on the cancellation date 
the low market value compared favorably to our million maximum possible exposure under the terms of the swap effective at the cancellation date 
in addition  we believe that our earnings volatility will be reduced as a result of the cancellation
