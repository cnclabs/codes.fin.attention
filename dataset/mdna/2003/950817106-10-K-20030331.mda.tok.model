participation in four risk pools managed by a berkshire insurance group member covering hull  liability  workers compensation and satellite exposures relating to the aviation industry  as follows with respect to  to the extent of for each pool  for  of the hull and liability pools  of the workers compensation pool and  effective mid year  of the satellite pool  and  for  of the hull and liability pools only 
the berkshire insurance group member provides a portion of the upper level reinsurance protection to these aviation 
table of contents risk pools  and therefore to wes fic  on terms that could cause some conflict of interest under certain conditions  eg  in settling some large loss 
the insurance industry  including wes fic  experienced significant reinsurance and insurance losses from the september  terrorist attack 
the terrorism risk insurance act of tria  enacted november   established for commercial property and casualty insurers but not as reinsurers see next paragraph a program providing for federal reinsurance of insured terrorism losses occurring after enactment 
under tria  a terrorism loss must have resulted from a terrorist act undertaken on behalf of a foreign person or interest which has resulted in an insured loss in excess of million  as certified by the federal government 
to be eligible for federal reinsurance  insurers must make available insurance coverage for acts of terrorism by providing policyholders with clear and conspicuous notice of the amount of premium that will be charged for this coverage and of the federal share of any insured losses resulting from any act of terrorism 
in the event of a certified act of terrorism  the federal government will reimburse each insurer conditioned on its satisfaction of policyholder notification requirements for of its insured losses in excess of the insurer s deductible 
the insurer s deductible is calculated based on the direct earned premiums for relevant commercial lines written by the insurer s entire insurance group 
for  the insurer s deductible is of its group s earned premiums  this rises to in and then to in assuming the tria program is extended to a third year 
the aggregate deductible amount for the berkshire insurance group including wesco s insurance subsidiaries is believed to approximate million for there is a billion cap on aggregate certified losses per tria program year all eligible insurers deductibles plus their share and the federal share above the deductibles  and insurers are free to exclude their liability for terrorism losses in excess of the cap 
assumed reinsurance is specifically excluded from tria participation 
thus  terrorism exclusions contained within reinsurance contracts remain in effect 
reinsurers are not required to offer terrorism coverage and are not eligible for federal reinsurance of terrorism losses 
wes fic  as a reinsurer  however  could indirectly benefit under tria essentially in proportion to applicable federal loss limitations that may be available to its ceding insurer customers 
although wes fic s and thus wesco s exposure to terrorism losses as a reinsurer or insurer  whether or not mitigated by tria  cannot be predicted  wes fic s management does not believe it likely that  on a worst case basis  wes fic s shareholder s equity would be severely impacted by future terrorism related insurance losses under reinsurance or insurance contracts currently in effect 
although wes fic has no active super catastrophe reinsurance contracts in force  its management has indicated that wes fic will likely have opportunities to participate in such business from time to time in the future 
management believes that an insurer in the reinsurance business must maintain large net worth in relation to annual premiums in order to remain solvent when called upon to pay claims when a loss occurs 
in this regard  wes fic is believed to operate differently from many other reinsurers in that risks it writes are entirely retained  while other reinsurers may retrocede portions of the risks to other reinsurers  thereby assuming contingent risks that such reinsurers will not be able to respond if called upon to pay off on risks reinsured 
in this respect wes fic and kbs are competitively well positioned  inasmuch as their net premiums written for calendar amounted to only of their combined statutory surplus  compared to an industry average of about based on figures reported for wes fic is also licensed to write direct insurance business as distinguished from reinsurance in nebraska  utah and iowa  and may write direct insurance in the non admitted excess and surplus lines market in several other states  but the volume written to date has been minimal 
in july  wes fic purchased kbs for approximately million in cash 
kbs provides specialized insurance coverage to more than of the banks in the united states  mostly small and medium sized banks in the midwest 
it is licensed to write business in states 
kbs is also subject to regulation by the department of the treasury 
its product line for financial institutions includes policies for crime insurance  check kiting fraud indemnification  internet banking catastrophe theft 
table of contents insurance  directors and officers liability  bank employment practices  and professional errors and omissions indemnity  as well as deposit guaranty bonds  which insure deposits in excess of federal deposit insurance limits 
kbs  which for many years had minimized its risks arising from large losses through cessions to third party reinsurers  restructured its reinsurance program effective january  in order to retain a much higher portion of its premiums and risks of loss 
wesco s management anticipates that kbs s reinsurance restructuring will improve operating results over the long term in return for greater short term volatility 
kbs markets its products in some states through exclusive  commissioned agents  and direct to insureds in other states 
inasmuch as the number of small midwestern banks is declining as the banking industry consolidates  kbs relies for growth on an extraordinary level of service provided by its dedicated employees and agents  and on new products such as deposit guaranty bonds  which were introduced in and currently account for approximately percent of premiums written 
standard poor s corporation  in recognition of wes fic s strong competitive position as a member of berkshire s family of wholly and substantially owned insurance subsidiaries and its unusual capital strength  has assigned its highest rating  aaa  to wes fic s claims paying ability 
this rating recognizes the commitment of wes fic s management to a disciplined approach to underwriting and reserving  as well as wes fic s extremely strong capital base 
wesco s and wes fic s boards are hopeful  but have no assurance  that the businesses of wes fic and kbs will grow 
they welcome the opportunity to participate in additional reinsurance retrocessions and other insurance arrangements  as well as acquisitions of other insurance companies 
insurance companies are subject to regulation by the departments of insurance of the various states in which they write policies as well as the states in which they are domiciled and  if applicable  as is the case with kbs  by the department of the treasury 
regulations relate to  among other things  capital requirements  shareholder and policyholder dividend restrictions  reporting requirements  annual audits by independent accountants  periodic regulatory examinations  and limitations on the size and types of investments that can be made 
wes fic  which is operated by nico  has no employees of its own 
kbs has employees 
furniture rental segment cort  acquired in february by a subsidiary of wesco  is the largest  and only national  provider of rental furniture  accessories and related services in the rent to rent as opposed to rent to own segment of the furniture industry 
it rents high quality furniture to corporate and individual customers who desire flexibility in meeting their temporary office  residential or trade show furnishing needs and who typically do not seek to own such furniture 
in addition  cort sells previously rented furniture through company owned clearance centers  thereby enabling it to regularly renew its inventory and update styles 
cort s national network includes showrooms  clearance centers and warehouses in states and the district of columbia as well as two websites  cortcom and corttradeshow 
com 
the rent to rent business is differentiated from the rent to own business primarily by the terms of the rental arrangements and the type of customer served 
rent to rent customers generally desire high quality furniture to meet temporary needs  have established credit  and pay on a monthly basis 
typically  these customers do not seek to acquire the property rented 
in the typical rent to rent transaction  the customer agrees to rent furniture for three to six months  subject to extension by the customer on a month to month basis 
by contrast  rent to own arrangements are generally made by customers without established credit whose objective is to acquire ownership of the property  these arrangements are typically entered into on a month to month basis and require weekly rental payments 
cort s customer base includes fortune companies  small businesses and professionals  and owners and operators of apartment communities 
cort s management believes that its size  national 
table of contents presence  consistently high level of customer service  product quality and breadth of selection  depth of management and efficient clearance centers have been key contributors to the company s success 
cort offers a full range of office and home furniture and furnishings  including panel systems  televisions  housewares and accessories 
cort emphasizes its ability to outfit an apartment  home or entire suite of offices with high quality furniture in two business days 
cort s objective is to build on these fundamentals and to further increase revenues by continuing to pursue its growth strategy 
the key components of this strategy are expanding its corporate customer base  capturing an increasing number of internet customers through enhancements to its on line catalog and web sites  making selective acquisitions  and continuing to invest in the development of various products and services 
cort believes that  as a result  over the long term  margins will expand and operating earnings will increase 
in order to capitalize on the significant profit potential available from longer average rental periods and the higher average monthly rent typically available for office products  cort s strategy is to place greater emphasis on rentals of office furniture than residential furniture 
in order to promote longer office lease terms  cort offers lower rates on leases where lease terms exceed six months 
a significant portion of cort s residential furniture rentals are derived from corporate relocations and temporary assignments  as new and transferred employees of cort s corporate customers enter into leases for residential furniture 
sales personnel maintain contact with corporate relocation departments and present the possibility of obtaining fully furnished rental apartments as a lower cost alternative to hotel accommodations 
thus  cort offers its corporate rental customers a way to reduce the costs of corporate relocation while developing residential business with new and transferred employees 
cort s relocation central corporation subsidiary relocation central was formed in january its relocationcentral 
com website provides information for individuals planning to relocate as well as an apartment locator service 
in addition  potential customers can call relocation central s customer management center for help in finding an apartment and selecting rental furniture  which is provided by cort 
as a result of the acquisition of its largest competitor in december  relocation central operates in metropolitan cities in sixteen states 
through joint marketing  relocation central and cort offer furniture rental referral opportunities to real estate investment trusts and other owners of housing communities and apartment houses 
cort s management hopes that  through relocation central  cort will become the principal source of furniture rentals for large  multi unit owners whose tenants require rental furniture 
to date  more than apartment communities refer their tenants to cort 
relocation central should be considered as still in a start up phase and  so far  has generated pre tax losses  amounting to million in and million in cort also provides short term rentals for trade shows and conventions 
its corttradeshow 
com website assists in providing information to and gathering leads from prospects 
until the economy weakened beginning late in  cort benefited from increasing demand for furniture rental services 
cort s management believed that this favorable trend had been caused by continued growth in management and professional employment  the increasing importance to american business of flexibility and outsourcing  and the impact of a more mobile and transitory population 
cort s management attributes the decline in business experienced throughout its industry in and to continued weakness of the economy  notably in the high technology sector  exacerbated by the terrorist activity on september  the rent to rent segment of the furniture rental industry is highly competitive 
there are several large regional as well as a number of smaller regional and local rent to rent furniture companies 
in addition  numerous retailers offer residential and office furniture under rent to own arrangements 
management believes that the principal competitive factors in the furniture rental industry are product value  furniture condition  extent of furniture selection  terms of rental agreement  speed of delivery  exchange privilege  option to purchase  deposit requirements and customer service 

table of contents the majority of cort s furniture sales revenue is from clearance center sales 
the remaining furniture sales revenue is derived primarily from lease conversions and sales of new furniture 
sales of rental furniture allow cort to control inventory levels and maintain showroom quality of rental inventory 
on average  furniture is typically sold through the clearance centers three years after its initial purchase by the company 
with respect to sales of furniture through its clearance centers  cort competes with numerous used and new furniture retailers  some of which are larger than cort 
management believes that price and value are its principal competitive advantages in this activity 
cort and relocation central have approximately  employees  including union members 
management considers labor relations to be good 
industrial segment precision steel  acquired in  and one of its subsidiaries operate steel service centers in the chicago and charlotte metropolitan areas 
the service centers buy stainless steel  low carbon sheet and strip steel  coated metals  spring steel  brass  phosphor bronze  aluminum and other metals  cut these metals to order  and sell them to a wide variety of customers 
the service center business is highly competitive 
precision steel s annual sales volume of approximately thousand tons of flat rolled products compares with the domestic steel service industry s annual volume of approximately million tons of comparable products 
precision steel competes not only with other service centers but also with mills which supply metal to the service centers 
sales competition exists in the areas of price  quality  availability and speed of delivery 
because it is willing to sell in relatively small quantities  precision steel has been able to compete in geographic areas distant from its service center facilities 
competitive pressure is intensified by imports and by an increasing tendency of domestic manufacturers to use less costly materials in making parts 
precision brand products  inc precision brand  a wholly owned subsidiary of precision steel that is also located in the chicago area  manufactures shim stock and other toolroom specialty items  and distributes a line of hose clamps and threaded rod 
these products are sold under the precision brand and dupage names nationwide  generally through industrial distributors 
this business is highly competitive 
precision brand s share of the toolroom specialty products market is believed to approximate  statistics are not available with respect to its share of the market for hose clamps and threaded rod 
steel service raw materials are obtained principally from major domestic steel mills  and their availability is considered good 
precision steel s service centers maintain extensive inventories in order to meet customer demand for prompt deliveries  typically  processed metals are delivered to the customer within one week 
precision brand normally maintains inventories adequate to allow for off the shelf service to customers within hours 
the industrial segment businesses are subject to economic cycles 
these businesses are not dependent on a few large customers 
the backlog of steel service orders amounted to million at both december  and december  there are full time employees engaged in the industrial segment businesses  about of whom are members of unions 
management considers labor relations to be good

table of contents earned premiums for  and included million  million and million attributable to wes fic  and million  million and million attributable to kbs 
at december   wes fic s in force reinsurance business consisted principally of a three year contract incepting in with a large  unaffiliated insurer  and a contract incepting in under which wes fic assumed aviation related risks 
wes fic s participation in the contract first described above was principally responsible for its earned premiums for wes fic s participation in the aviation risk pool increased from approximately for risks incepting in to for the year 
written and earned premiums increased accordingly 
the increases in premiums written by kbs in recent years have been principally due to growth in volume of bank deposit guarantee bonds  this product currently accounts for approximately of premiums written by kbs 
the underwriting gain loss for  and included million  million and million attributable to kbs  and 
million  million and 
million attributable to wes fic 
wes fic s underwriting loss in resulted mainly from a loss provision of million before income taxes million after taxes recorded as a result of the terrorist activity of september  the amount is an estimate and is subject to considerable estimation error  in addition  management believes that it will take years to resolve complicated coverage issues  which could have a material effect on the ultimate loss incurred 
underwriting results of kbs have been more volatile since it restructured its program for reinsurance in in order to retain a much higher portion of its premiums and risks of loss 
aggregate underwriting results benefited by 
million  million and million in  and from net downward revisions of estimated liabilities for losses and loss adjustment expenses established for events occurring in prior years 
insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses  and the related liabilities reflected on wesco s consolidated balance sheet  because they are estimates  are subject to estimation error 
revisions of such estimates in future periods could significantly affect the results of operations reported for those periods 
since september   the insurance industry has been particularly concerned about its exposure to claims resulting from acts of terrorism 
as explained in item  business  in spite of relief provided by enactment of the terrorism risk insurance act tria on november   wes fic is exposed to insurance losses from terrorist events covered by tria occurring after that date as well as terrorism losses not covered by tria 
while wes fic s and thus wesco s exposure to such losses from an insurance standpoint cannot be predicted  wes fic s management does not believe it likely that  on a worst case basis  wes fic s shareholders equity would be severely impacted by future terrorism related insurance losses under reinsurance or insurance contracts currently in effect 
another industry concern has been its exposure to loss from environmental contamination  particularly asbestos related claims 
wes fic s management currently believes such exposure to be minimal 
dividend and interest income has been earned by the insurance group principally on earnings retained and reinvested by wes fic  on capital contributed by wesco  and on float funds invested pending payment of claims 
dividend and interest income  before income taxes  was essentially unchanged in from the amount earned in  after having increased million in from the figure 
the increase in was due principally to the sale of wes fic s investment in freddie mac common stock in various transactions throughout the proceeds of billion were reinvested mainly in fixed income securities 
the income tax provision of the insurance segment fluctuated as a percentage of its pre tax income from year to year during the period presented in the foregoing table mainly due to the relationship of substantially tax exempt components of income to total pre tax income 
a significant marketing advantage enjoyed by berkshire s insurance subsidiaries  including wesco s insurance segment  is the maintenance of extraordinary capital strength 
the combined 
table of contents statutory surplus of wesco s insurance businesses totaled approximately billion at december  this capital strength creates opportunities for the wesco subsidiaries to participate in reinsurance and insurance contracts not necessarily available to many of their competitors 
although wesco would welcome other attractive reinsurance or insurance arrangements  or acquisitions of insurance businesses  the timing and extent of any increase in its insurance underwriting activity cannot presently be predicted

the increase in cost percentage in was reduced somewhat due to a decrease in depreciation expense  as cort purchased less new product in than in the prior year  cort depreciates its rental furniture under the declining balance method  whereby recorded depreciation is exceptionally high in the first year and declines in each successive year

cort expects that  as a result  sg a expenses will drop through the closing of redundant or underperforming locations  reductions in payroll and other expenses  and economies of scale

revenues for decreased from the corresponding figure  pounds of steel products sold decreased 
precision steel is continuing to suffer from extraordinary competitive pressures  as well as from a prolonged downturn in domestic manufacturing activity attributable both to ongoing weakness in the economy and the shift by many manufacturers from domestic to overseas production facilities 
the failure of revenues to keep pace with pounds sold in was attributable principally to deflation in sales prices 
steel mills and other suppliers have lowered many prices  allowing precision steel  in turn  to lower many of its selling prices while not significantly affecting gross profit margins 
in  there was a significant reduction in demand due both to ongoing weakness in the economy and increased competitive pressures  already extreme  and a change in mix of products sold toward lower priced products 
income before income taxes and net income of the industrial segment are dependent not only on revenues  but also on operating expenses and the cost of products sold 
the latter  as a percentage of revenues  amounted to  and for  and the cost percentage typically fluctuates slightly from year to year as a result of changes in product mix and price competition at all levels 
precision steel s cost of products sold percentage is very sensitive to current changes in the cost of materials purchased  because it carries its inventories at the lower of last in  first out lifo cost or market  under this method  the most recent costs are reflected in cost of goods sold

in the case of the wesco group  it relates to the acquisitions of cort and kbs  as well as smaller entities acquired by cort following its purchase by wesco in february prior to  goodwill was amortized mainly on a straight line basis over years 
as explained in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  effective as of the beginning of  wesco discontinued amortization of goodwill and became subject to other changes in goodwill accounting  as required by the financial accounting standards board 
the increase in amortization of goodwill for was due principally to the inclusion of a full year s amortization of cort goodwill in  versus less than eleven months in realized gains and losses on the wesco group s investments have fluctuated in amount from year to year  sometimes impacting net income significantly  as in however  the amounts and timing of these realizations have no predictive or practical analytical value 
wesco s investments are carried at market value  and unrealized gains or losses are reflected  net of potential income tax effect  in the unrealized appreciation component of its shareholders equity 
when gains or losses are realized  due to sale of securities or other triggering event  they are credited or charged  net of tax effect  to the consolidated statement of income  generally  in wesco s case  there has been little effect on total shareholders equity merely a transfer from unrealized appreciation to retained earnings 
wesco s consolidated earnings for contained net realized securities gains  after income taxes  of million  no gains or losses were realized in or other nonsegment items include mainly rental income from owned commercial real estate and dividend and interest income from marketable securities and cash equivalents owned outside the insurance subsidiaries  reduced by real estate and general and administrative expenses plus or minus income taxes related to such items 
these taxes do not correlate well with total pre tax income  because dividend income is substantially tax exempt 
net income from other nonsegment activities typically fluctuates from period to period but is not significant in amount 

table of contents wesco s effective consolidated income tax rate typically fluctuates from period to period for various reasons  such as the inclusion in consolidated revenues of significant  varying amounts of dividend income  which is substantially exempt from income taxes 
the respective income tax provisions  expressed as percentages of income before income taxes  amounted to  and in  and see note to wesco s accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information on income taxes 
management s principal goal is to maximize gain in wesco s intrinsic business value per share over the long term 
accounting consequences do not influence business decisions 
there is no particular strategy as to the timing of sales of investments 
securities may be sold for a variety of reasons  including the belief that prospects for future appreciation of a particular investment are less attractive than the prospects for reinvestment of the after tax proceeds from its sale  or the desire to generate funds for an acquisition or repayment of debt 
consolidated revenues  expenses and net income reported for any period are not necessarily indicative of future revenues  expenses and net income in that they are subject to significant variations in amount and timing of securities gains and losses  as well as other unusual nonoperating items such as the acquisition of cort 
in addition  consolidated revenues  expenses and net income are subject to external conditions such as the ongoing weakness of the economy  which continues to adversely affect cort and precision steel  and the september  terrorist activity  which had an immediate impact on wes fic s operating results 
as explained in item  business  in spite of relief provided by enactment of the terrorism risk insurance act tria on november   wes fic is exposed to losses from terrorist events covered by tria occurring after that date as well as terrorism losses not covered by tria 
although wes fic s and thus wesco s exposure to terrorism losses cannot be predicted  wes fic s management does not believe it likely that  on a worst case basis  wes fic s shareholder s equity would be severely impacted by any terrorism related insurance losses under reinsurance or insurance contracts currently in effect 
shareholders equity is impacted not only to the extent that unusual items affect earnings  but also to reflect changes in unrealized appreciation of investments  which are not reflected in earnings 
wesco is not now suffering from inflation  but its business operations have potential exposure  particularly in the insurance and industrial segments 
large unanticipated changes in the rate of inflation could adversely impact the insurance business  because premium rates are established well in advance of expenditures 
precision steel s businesses are competitive and operate on tight gross profit margins  making their earnings susceptible to inflationary and deflationary cost changes  the impact  though not material in relation to wesco s consolidated net income  may be significant to that of the industrial segment  due particularly to the segment s use of lifo inventory accounting 
critical accounting policies wesco s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the more important accounting principles and policies followed by wesco are set forth in the notes to wesco s consolidated financial statements appearing on pages through of this report 
following are the accounting principles and policies considered by wesco s management to be critical to its determination of consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements management is required to make estimates and assumptions based on evaluation of facts and circumstances using information currently available 
for example  the process of establishing loss reserves for property and casualty reinsurance and insurance is subject to considerable estimation error due to the inherent uncertainty in projecting the claim amounts that will be reported and ultimately paid over many years 
although the amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses included in the consolidated financial statements may differ 
table of contents significantly from those that might result from use of estimates and assumptions based on facts and circumstances not yet available  wesco s management does not believe such differences would have a material adverse effect on reported shareholders equity 
a significant amount of judgment is required in performing the periodic impairment tests of goodwill of acquired businesses required under statement of financial accounting standards no 
such tests include determining or reviewing the estimated fair value of wesco s reporting units 
fair value refers to the amount for which the entire reporting unit may be bought or sold 
there are several methods of estimating reporting unit values  including market quotations  asset and liability fair values  discounted cash flows  and multiples of earnings or revenues 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit  including goodwill  were to exceed the estimated fair value  then individual assets  including identifiable intangible assets  and liabilities of the reporting unit would be estimated at fair value  the excess of the carrying amount over the estimated fair value would be charged off as an impairment loss 
goodwill of acquired businesses on wesco s consolidated balance sheet amounted to million at december  the appropriate classifications of investments in securities with fixed maturities and marketable equity securities are established at the time of purchase and reevaluated as of each balance sheet date 
there are three permissible classifications held to maturity  trading  and  when neither of those classifications is applicable  available for sale 
in recent years wesco s management has classified all of its equity and fixed maturity investments as available for sale  they are carried at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses  net of deemed applicable income taxes  reported as a separate component of shareholders equity 
liabilities for insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses as of any balance sheet date represent estimates of the ultimate amounts payable under property and casualty reinsurance contracts related to losses occurring on or before the balance sheet date 
as of that date  some incurred claims have not yet been reported and some of these may not be reported for many years  the liability for unpaid losses must include significant estimates for these claims 
additionally  reported claims are in various stages of the settlement process 
each claim is settled individually based upon its merits  and some take years to settle  especially if legal action is involved 
actual ultimate claims amounts are likely to differ from amounts recorded at the balance sheet date 
changes in estimates are recorded as a component of losses incurred in the period of change 
liabilities for insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses on wesco s consolidated balance sheet amounted to million at december  insurance premiums are recognized as earned revenues in proportion to the insurance protection provided  which in most cases is pro rata over the term of each contract 
unearned insurance premiums are deferred in the liability section of the consolidated balance sheet 
certain costs of acquiring premiums are deferred in other assets on wesco s consolidated balance sheet  and charged to income as the premiums are earned 
furniture rentals are recognized as revenue in the month due  rentals received in advance are deferred in the liability section of wesco s consolidated balance sheet 
related costs comprise the main element of cost of products and services sold on wesco s consolidated income statement and include depreciation expense  repairs and maintenance and inventory losses 
rental furniture consists principally of residential and office furniture which is available for rental or  if no longer up to rental standards  for sale 
it is carried on wesco s consolidated balance sheet at cost  less accumulated depreciation calculated primarily on a declining balance basis over to years using estimated salvage values of to percent of original cost 
forward looking statements certain written or oral representations of management stated in this annual report or elsewhere constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of  as contrasted with statements of historical fact 
forward looking statements include 
table of contents statements which are predictive in nature  or which depend upon or refer to future events or conditions  or which include words such as expects  anticipates  intends  plans  believes  estimates  may  or could  or which involve hypothetical events 
forward looking statements are based on information currently available and are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from those characterized as being likely or possible to occur 
such statements should be considered judgments only  not guarantees  and wesco s management assumes no duty  nor has it any specific intention  to update them 
actual events and results may differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in forward looking statements due to a number of factors 
the principal important risk factors that could cause wesco s actual performance and future events and actions to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by such forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  changes in market prices of wesco s significant equity investments  the occurrence of one or more catastrophic events such as hurricanes or other events that cause losses insured by wesco s insurance subsidiaries  changes in insurance laws or regulations  changes in income tax laws or regulations  and changes in general economic and market factors that affect the prices of securities or the industries in which wesco and its affiliates do business  especially those affecting the property and casualty insurance industry 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk wesco s consolidated balance sheet contains substantial amounts of investments whose estimated fair carrying values are subject to market risks 
values of marketable equity securities are subject to fluctuations in their stock market prices  and values of securities with fixed maturities are subject to changes in interest rate levels 
otherwise  the consolidated balance sheet at december  did not contain significant assets or liabilities with values subject to these or other potential market exposures such as those relating to changes in commodity prices or foreign exchange rates 
wesco does not utilize stand alone derivatives to manage market risks 
equity price risk wesco s consolidated balance sheet at december  contained million of marketable equity securities stated at market value  down from million one year earlier 
the decline was due to a decline in market values  no marketable equity securities were purchased or sold during the carrying values of wesco s equity securities are exposed to market price fluctuations  which may be accentuated by the concentration existing in the equity portfolio 
at december   two investments comprised of the carrying value of the consolidated equity portfolio 
in addition  the businesses represented by the equity investments are exposed to risks related to other markets 
the two largest holdings of the consolidated group at december  million  combined were common stocks of the coca cola company and the gillette company  both of which have global operations and thus are subject to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
these and other market risks to which these investees are subject  such as commodity price fluctuations  are required  where material  to be reported upon in their filings with the sec  which are available to the public 
strategically  wesco strives to invest in businesses that possess excellent economics  with able and honest management  at sensible prices 
wesco s management prefers to invest a meaningful amount in each investee  resulting in concentration 
most equity investments are expected to be held for long periods of time  thus  wesco s management is not ordinarily troubled by short term price volatility with respect to its investments provided that the underlying business  economic and management characteristics of the investees remain favorable 
wesco strives to maintain above average levels of shareholders equity to provide a margin of safety against short term equity price volatility 
the carrying values of investments subject to equity price risks are based on quoted market prices 
market prices are subject to fluctuation and  consequently  the amount realized upon the 
table of contents subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value 
fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the investee  the relative prices of alternative investments  or general market conditions 
furthermore  amounts realized upon the sale of a particular security may be adversely affected if a relatively large quantity of the security is being sold 
the following table summarizes wesco s equity price risks as of december  and it shows the effects of a hypothetical overall increase or decrease in market prices of marketable equity securities owned by the wesco group on total recorded market value and  after tax effect  on wesco s shareholders equity at each of those dates 
amounts are in thousands 
december  december  increase decrease increase decrease market value of marketable equity securities as recorded hypothetical shareholders equity as recorded hypothetical the hypothetical changes in market values assumed in preparing the tables do not reflect what could be considered best or worst case scenarios 
indeed  actual results could be much worse or better due both to the nature of equity markets and the aforementioned concentration existing in wesco s equity investment portfolio 
interest rate risk wesco s consolidated balance sheet at december  contained million of securities with fixed maturities stated at fair value  down from million one year earlier 
a decrease in mortgage backed securities million at december  versus million one year earlier was substantially offset by increases in us government and other securities 
as noted in the preceding section on equity price risk  wesco prefers to acquire entire businesses or invest in equity securities 
when unable to do so  it may invest in mortgage backed securities  government bonds or other interest rate sensitive investments 
wesco s strategy is to acquire securities that are attractively priced in relation to perceived credit risk 
wesco recognizes and accepts that losses may occur 
the fair values of wesco s fixed maturity investments fluctuate in response to changes in market interest rates 
increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values 
additionally  fair values of these investments may be affected by the creditworthiness of the issuer  prepayment options  relative values of alternative investments  the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions 
the following table shows the estimated effects as of december  and of hypothetical overall increases and decreases in interest rates on the fair value of wesco s fixed 
table of contents maturity investments and  after tax effect  on wesco s shareholders equity at each of those dates 
dollar amounts are in thousands 
december  december  fair value of shareholders fair value of shareholders investments equity investments equity as recorded hypothetical change in interest rate percentage point decrease percentage point increase percentage point increase percentage point increase the hypothetical changes in market interest rates assumed in preparing the table do not reflect what could be deemed best or worst case scenarios 
for example  variations in market interest rates could produce significant changes in the timing of repayments of mortgage backed securities due to prepayment options available to borrowers under the mortgages 
for this and other reasons  actual results might differ from those reflected in the table
