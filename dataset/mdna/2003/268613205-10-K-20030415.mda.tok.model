taking into account reasonable and prudent tax planning strategies and future income projections  the net deferred tax asset of  represents the amount of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards that management believes more likely than not will be realized over their remaining lives 
the remaining valuation allowance is necessary due to the magnitude of these net operating loss carryforwards and the uncertainty of future income estimates 
failure to achieve forecasted taxable income would affect the ultimate realization of the net deferred tax assets 
the company s ability to utilize its net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be impaired or reduced under certain other circumstances 
events which may affect these carryforwards include  but are not limited to  cumulative stock ownership changes of or more over any three year period  as defined under the internal revenue code irc 
management recognizes that it is limited in its ability to prevent such cumulative changes in ownership from occurring 
if a change of ownership for tax purposes were to occur and no assurance can be given that one will not occur factors such as the number of common shares issued and outstanding  the market price of such shares  and short term treasury rates would be used to determine the amount of the tax loss and credit carryforwards that can be utilized each year under current tax laws

liquidity and capital resources available resources 
the company s consolidated unrestricted cash positions at december  and was  and  respectively 
the company s borrowing availability under its bank line of credit at december  and was  and  respectively 
the company has a cash management system whereby cash generated by operations is used to immediately reduce bank debt 
the reduction of outstanding debt provides the company with a reduction in interest expense greater than the interest income that the cash could safely earn from alternative investments 
working capital needs  when they arise  are met by borrowings 
during  the company had cash flow from operations of  the cash flow from operations  the proceeds from the sale of property  building and equipment of  and the collection of notes receivable of  funded the purchase of property  plant and equipment of  the payment of net borrowings under the bank line of credit and term loan of  principal payments of other debt totaling  the purchases of common stock for  the payments of deferred financing fees of  and the payment of capital lease obligations of  during  current assets decreased by  primarily due to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents  a decrease in cues accounts receivable and a decrease in corporate taxes receivable which was partially offset by an increase in prepaid expense and other current assets and deferred tax assets

on april   the company entered into an amended and restated loan and security agreement the new credit agreement with bofa 
on december  and january   under amendments to the new credit agreement  the company converted its outstanding orange county industrial development authority  industrial development revenue bonds elxsi project  series the idb bonds  into a second term loan with bofa due june  at december   the company was in violation of the funded debt to ebitda covenant and other non financial covenants  and therefore was in default under the provisions of the new credit agreement 
on january   the company entered into an amendment to the new credit agreement that included a waiver by bofa of all covenant violations 
this amendment also included the following terms  which represent changes from the new credit agreement an extension of the maturity date of all bofa debt to june  with the payment of a  extension fee  at the company s option  a further extension of the maturity date of all bofa debt until january  with the payment of an additional fee of  in june  interest on all bofa debt at bofa s prime rate plus which interest rate will increase to bofa s prime rate plus if the company exercises its option to extend the maturity date of all bofa debt until january   an increase in the interest rate on april  to bofa s prime rate plus and the requirement to pay a non refundable  fee unless the company has obtained by that date an acceptable loan commitment letter from another lender or has hired an investment banker to sell either its cues division or restaurant operations  and the establishment of revised covenants for  including an ebitda  net worth and capital expenditure covenant 
the company expects to be in compliance with the revised terms and covenants of the new credit agreement as amended  however  the new credit agreement contains provisions which allow bofa to accelerate payment of the amounts due under the new credit agreement if they determine that a material adverse change has occurred in the company 
the consolidated financial statements include an independent auditor s report which indicates that these provisions raise substantial doubt as to the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
management believes it will be successful in obtaining financing to replace the amounts due under the new credit agreement prior to its maturity on january  in the event that sufficient additional financing cannot be obtained prior to the maturity date to repay amounts due under the agreement  the company believes several options are available to generate additional liquidity 
future needs for and sources of capital 
management believes that cash generated by operations plus cash available under the new credit agreement  as amended  will be sufficient to fund future operations  including interest payments on bank debt and payments due under the phantom stock option plan 
management believes that the bank line of credit and term loans with bofa will be refinanced prior to their maturity date of june  or extended maturity date of january  critical accounting policies 
the company s significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
certain of the company s accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
as with all judgments  they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  current economic trends in the industry  information provided by customers and vendors and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
the company s significant accounting policies include allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on numerous factors  including past transaction history with particular customers and their creditworthiness 
initially  the company estimates an allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net sales based on historical bad debt experience 
this estimate is adjusted when the company becomes aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  or as a result of changes in the overall aging of accounts receivable 
while the company has a large customer base that is geographically dispersed  a slowdown in the markets in which the company operates may result in higher than expected uncollectible accounts  and therefore the need to revise the estimate for bad debts 
generally  cues has experienced relatively low bad debt expense partially because customers depend on the company to provide parts and labor to repair and service equipment  which gives them a strong incentive to pay past due balances 
during  the company increased its allowance for doubtful accounts as a result of a bankruptcy filing by a contractor customer of cues 
the allowance for doubtful accounts totaled  and  at december  and  respectively 
inventories 
the company evaluates its inventory balances at the end of each quarter to ensure that they are carried at the lower of cost or market 
this evaluation includes a review for obsolete inventory and an analysis of slow moving and potential excess inventory items 
events which could affect the amount of reserves for obsolete or slow moving inventory include a decrease in demand for cues s products due to economic conditions  innovations or new technologies introduced by cues or its competitors  price decreases by competitors on specific products or systems  and any discontinuance by a vendor of a component part required in production requiring a re design of a cues product 
at december  and  the reserve for obsolete and slow moving inventory was  and  respectively 
deferred tax assets 
the company s net deferred tax assets include substantial amounts of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards  totaling  and  at december  and  respectively 
the carrying value of the company s net deferred tax assets assumes that the company will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income based on estimates and assumptions 
if these estimates and assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record additional valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets  which would result in increased income tax expense 
the company continually reviews the adequacy of the valuation allowance and recognizes deferred tax asset benefits only as reassessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the benefits will be realized 
failure to achieve forecasted taxable income would affect the ultimate realization of the net deferred tax assets 
the utilization of the company s net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be impaired or reduced under certain circumstances 
events which may affect the company s ability to utilize these carryforwards include  but are not limited to  future profitability  cumulative stock ownership changes of or more over a given three year period  as defined by internal revenue code irc  and the timing of the utilization of the tax benefit carryforwards 
such changes in ownership would significantly restrict the company s ability to utilize loss and credit carryforwards in accordance with the irc 
related party notes receivable 
the company is owed substantial amounts under related party promissory notes receivable see note to the consolidated financial statements 
these notes have been reflected in the equity section of the balance sheet as a contra equity account at december  and alexander m 
milley and certain companies he controls have guaranteed payment of these notes 
in addition  mr 
milley and these companies have pledged certain assets  including shares of company common stock  under pledge and security agreements 
a permanent decline in the value of the company s stock or other assets pledged as collateral or a default in the payment of the principal and interest by these related parties would have a negative effect on the company s operating results and potentially its ability to repay its outstanding debt 
impairment of long lived assets 
the company s long lived assets include  and  of goodwill and trademarks at december  and  respectively 
in assessing the recoverability of the company s intangible assets  the company must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  fas in as a result of the adoption of fas during the year ended december   the company recorded a loss for the cumulative effect of an accounting change related to the goodwill impairment at the cues division in the amount of  the company did not record any impairment losses related to goodwill and or trademarks in the restaurant operations division during product warranties 
our warranty reserve is established based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date 
while we believe that our warranty reserve is adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate  such amounts estimated to be due and payable could differ materially from what will actually transpire in the future 
recent accounting pronouncements fas no 
 business combinations and fas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  were issued in july fas requires all business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
fas also specifies the criteria which must be met in order for certain acquired intangible assets to be recorded separately from goodwill 
fas became effective for the company beginning with the company s first quarter of under fas  goodwill is no longer amortized but rather will be tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
this new approach requires the use of valuation techniques and methodologies significantly different than the previous undiscounted cash flow policy utilized by the company 
during the year ended december   the company recorded a loss for the cumulative effect of an accounting change related to the goodwill impairment at the cues division in the amount of  the company did not record any impairment losses related to goodwill and or trademarks in the restaurant division during the new approach may result in impairment charges and reductions in the carrying amount of the remaining goodwill on the company s consolidated balance sheets and as a result  the company may be subject to earnings volatility if additional goodwill impairment occurs at a future date
