item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  including  without limitation  statements with respect to growth plans  projected sales  revenues  earnings and costs  and product development schedules and plans  information included or incorporated by reference in our future filings with the 
table of contents securities and exchange commission including  without limitation  statements with respect to growth plans  projected sales  revenues  earnings and costs  and product development schedules and plans and information contained in written material  releases and oral statements issued by us  or on our behalf  including  without limitation  statements with respect to growth plans  projected sales  revenues  earnings and costs  and product development schedules and plans 
our actual results may differ materially from those contained in the forward looking statements identified above 
factors which may cause such a difference to occur include  but are not limited to  the following reliance on single product line 
our accelerated reader software and supplemental accelerated reader quizzes accounted for approximately   and of our net sales in   and  respectively 
an overall decline in sales of accelerated reader and supplemental quizzes  including sales through book distributors  would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
dependence on continued product development 
the educational technology and professional development markets in which we compete are characterized by evolving industry standards  frequent product introductions  and sudden technological change 
our future success will depend  to a significant extent  on a number of factors  including our ability to enhance our existing products and develop and successfully introduce new products  including new products designed for use in other areas of the curriculum  our ability to introduce new products in a timely fashion and our ability to respond quickly and in a cost effective manner to technological change  including shifts in operating systems  languages  alternative delivery systems and other environments 
there can be no assurance that new products will be as well received as our established products  particularly since such other products may require technology and or resources not generally available in all schools 
we attempt to maintain high standards for the demonstrated academic effectiveness of our products 
our adherence to these standards could delay or inhibit the introduction of new products 
moreover  there can be no assurance that our products will not be rendered obsolete or that we will have sufficient resources to make the necessary investments or be able to develop and market the products required to maintain our competitive position 
management of growth 
we have historically experienced rapid growth 
rapid growth may place a strain on our financial  management  systems  and other resources 
our ability to manage our growth effectively will require us to attract  train  motivate  manage  and retain key employees and to improve our operational  financial  and management information systems 
if we were unable to maintain and manage growth effectively  our business  financial condition  and results of operations could be adversely affected 
selling and marketing strategy and product acceptance 
our business strategy includes the introduction of new products and services directed at new markets as well as the development of new sales and distribution channels 
for example  our generation learning systems subsidiary  sells enterprise software for training and knowledge management primarily to businesses and government organizations 
we have historically focused on the education market and have significantly less experience in developing and marketing products and services to business or government customers 
additionally  in the educational market  we are increasing our district level field sales efforts 
historically our primary selling efforts have been directed towards individual schools through telephone sales representatives and we have significantly less experience selling our products and services to school districts through a field sales force 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in offering new products and services  entering new markets and developing new sales and distribution channels as planned or that any such products or services  if introduced  will achieve acceptance in the marketplace 
risks of international expansion 
a key component of our growth strategy is to continue to expand our operations into international markets 
doing business in international markets is subject to a number of risks  including  among others acceptance by foreign educational systems of our approach to educational products  lack of existing customer base  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  potentially adverse tax consequences  tariffs and other trade barriers  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  changing economic conditions  exposure to different legal standards particularly with respect to intellectual property  burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws  and fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
if any of 
table of contents these risks were to materialize  our business  financial condition  and results of operations could be adversely affected 
educational philosophies 
our products do not espouse a particular philosophy of instruction  rather we support all teaching methods and curricula by focusing on continuous feedback  increased student practice of essential skills  and demonstrated product effectiveness through measurable results 
certain educators  academics  politicians  and theorists  however  declaim strong philosophies of instruction  that can lead them to oppose educational products or services that fall outside a very narrow definition 
these philosophies can include  but are not limited to  opposition to standardized testing or over reliance on the same  opposition to computers or motivational techniques  exclusive focus on particular types of direct instruction  and highly technical definitions of acceptable research 
some of these philosophical stances have the capacity to influence the market for our products and services  and such influence could have a material adverse impact on demand and thus on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
dependence on educational institutions and government funding 
substantially all of our revenue is derived from sales to educational institutions  individual educators  and suppliers thereto 
there can be no assurance that educational institutions and or individual educators will continue to invest in technology based products and professional development for reading and other curricula or continue to respond favorably to our marketing 
our inability to increase the number of products sold or number of schools served would adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
because of our dependence on educational institutions  the funding of which is largely dependent on government support  a substantial decrease in government budgets or funding for educational software or technology would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
any economic slow down which would negatively affect school funding could adversely impact the sale of our products and services to schools 
in addition  certain aspects of government sponsored education initiatives may not endorse  or be complementary to  the principles and methodologies underlying and associated with our products and services  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
geographic concentration of sales 
a substantial portion of our sales is concentrated in several states  including california  texas  florida  north carolina  and georgia  which accounted for approximately million  million  million  million  and million  respectively  of our net sales in if large numbers of schools or a district or districts controlling a large number of schools in such states were to discontinue purchasing our products and services  our business  financial condition  and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
highly competitive industry 
the educational technology and professional development markets in which we operate are very competitive 
we compete with other companies offering educational software products to schools 
in addition  we compete against more traditional methods of education  training and testing  including pencil and paper testing 
our existing competitors may continue to broaden their product lines  and potential competitors  including large hardware manufacturers  software developers and educational publishers  may enter or increase their focus on the school market  resulting in greater competition for us 
success in selling our products  particularly our reading products  may cause competitors to focus on our products in their marketing efforts thereby increasing direct competition 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to market our products successfully or compete effectively in the educational marketplace 
dependence on key personnel 
our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued active participation of certain key members of management  including our chairman  judith paul  and our chief executive officer  terrance paul 
ms 
paul acts as our spokesperson and coordinates our public relations and customer communications policies 
mr 
paul is responsible for our long term strategic planning  new product development strategy  sales and marketing strategy and overall direction of our company  and plays a key role in our research activities 
we do not have employment agreements with either of these persons and have no current intention of entering into any such employment agreements 
the loss of the services of either of these persons would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 

table of contents ability to attract and retain qualified personnel 
our future success will depend  in part  upon our continuing ability to retain the employees  including senior management personnel  who have assisted in the development and marketing of our products and to attract and retain qualified additional employees trained in computer technology  sales  marketing  finance  and other disciplines to enhance our product offerings and broaden our operations 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to attract and retain such personnel 
the failure to attract or retain the necessary personnel would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
fluctuations in quarterly performance 
we generally ship products as orders are received  and therefore  we have historically operated without a significant backlog of products 
thus  product revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent on the quantity of product orders received in that quarter 
the quantity of product orders in any quarter can be affected by a variety of factors  including the following delays in the development and or shipment of new products can adversely affect our revenue in one or more quarters  the closing of large contract sales  such as those to school districts  the shipment of new products for which orders have been building for some period of time can cause the revenues in the quarter in which shipment occurs to be higher than revenues in preceding or subsequent quarters  and seasonal variations due to  among other things  the budget and school year cycles of our school customers 
in addition to fluctuations in product orders  our quarterly results can also be affected by the following charges related to acquisitions  including acquisition expenses  the write off of in process research and development  the amortization of intangible assets  and similar items  charges related to obsolete or impaired assets  supply chain issues such as manufacturing problems  delivery delays  or quality issues  expenses related to product development and marketing initiatives  and expenses for product support costs 
our overall gross margins also fluctuate based upon the mix of product sales and service sales 
we realize significantly higher margins on our product sales 
service revenues tend to be more seasonal than product revenues  resulting in seasonal variations in margins 
quarterly service revenues are typically highest in the third quarter 
share price volatility 
numerous factors  many of which are beyond our control  may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly 
these factors include announcements of technological innovations and or new products by us and our competitors  earnings releases and earnings warnings by us and our competitors  expectations regarding government funding levels for education  market conditions in the industry  and the general state of the securities markets 
the market price of our common stock may decline significantly if we fail to meet the published earnings estimates of analysts and others 
in addition  quarterly fluctuations of our results of operations as described above may cause a significant variation in the market price of our common stock 
limited protection of intellectual property and proprietary rights 
we regard certain of our technologies as proprietary and rely primarily on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and employee non disclosure agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
we also employ serialization techniques to prevent unauthorized installation of our products and content 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by us to protect our rights will be adequate to prevent or deter misappropriation 
in addition  while we do not believe that our products  trademarks or other proprietary rights infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties  there can be no assurance that a third party will not make a contrary assertion 
the cost of responding to such an assertion may be material  whether or not the assertion is 
table of contents validated 
the software publishing industry has traditionally experienced widespread unauthorized reproduction of products in violation of intellectual property rights 
such activity is difficult to detect and legal proceedings to enforce intellectual property rights are often burdensome and involve a high degree of uncertainty and costs 
there can be no assurance that our software products will not experience unauthorized reproduction  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
war  acts of war and terrorism 
delays and reductions in purchases of our products and services may occur as a result of war  acts of war and terrorism  and the related impacts  including a reduction of funds available to our customers to purchase our products and services and disruptions in our ability to develop  produce and distribute products and services to our customers 
these events would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
concentration of share ownership  control by principal shareholders management 
as of february   our principal shareholders  judith paul  our chairman  and terrance paul  our chief executive officer  beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding common stock 
as a result  these principal shareholders have the ability to control and direct our business and affairs 
shares eligible for future sale 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could adversely affect the market price of the common stock 
as of february   approximately million shares of our common stock were held by affiliates and may be publicly sold only if registered under the securities act of or sold in accordance with an applicable exemption from registration  such as rule in addition  we have filed registration statements under the securities act of to register an aggregate of  shares of common stock reserved for issuance under our stock incentive plan and an aggregate of  shares of common stock reserved for issuance under our employee stock purchase plan  which will  when issued in accordance with such plans  be eligible for immediate sale in the public market  subject to the rule resale limitations for affiliates 
we intend to file an amendment to the registration statement relating to our stock incentive plan in april to register an additional  shares thereafter assuming we receive shareholder approval of this increase under the plan 
our principal shareholders  judith and terrance paul  have adopted a securities trading plan with respect to a portion of their company common stock 
the plan provides for the sale of approximately of the pauls current holdings of common stock on an annual basis 
the plan provides for monthly sales  subject to various legal and contractual limitations 
cash dividends 
we currently intend to retain all of our future earnings to fund growth  acquisition opportunities and the operation of our business 
future cash dividends  if any  will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon  among other things  our future operations and earnings  capital requirements and surplus  general financial condition  contractual restrictions  and such other factors as the board of directors may deem relevant 
possible antitakeover effects of certain articles and by law provisions and provisions of wisconsin law 
our amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated by laws  along with wisconsin statutory law  contain provisions that could discourage potential acquisition proposals and might delay or prevent a change in control of renaissance learning  inc such provisions could result in our being less attractive to a potential acquirer and could result in the shareholders receiving less for their common stock than otherwise might be available in the event of a takeover attempt

we provide teacher training through our reading renaissance  math renaissance  writing renaissance  renaissance early literacy  the reading renaissance librarian  renaissance diagnosis and intervention  renaissance leadership  renaissance classroom management  and renaissance test strategies seminars 
our sales are derived primarily from the sale of software products  software support agreements  and professional development services 
revenues are recorded net of an allowance for estimated returns 
allowances for bad debts are also recorded at the time of the sale 
product revenue is derived primarily from the sale of software products 
we recognize revenue from sales of our off the shelf software products at the time of shipment to customers 
we recognize revenue from the sale of software products which require significant customization or modification on the percentage of completion method of accounting 
revenue from subscription based products is recognized on a straight line basis over the subscription period 
service revenue is derived from i training seminars  ii consulting services  and iii software support agreements whereby we provide ongoing customer support as well as unspecified product upgrades if and when available 
revenue from training seminars is recognized when the seminar is performed 
revenue from consulting services is recognized as the service is performed or on a straight line basis over the contractual period 
telephone support included with software sales has a duration of twelve months or less and is recognized at the time the software is shipped with the related costs of providing the telephone support accrued for at the same time 
revenue from separately sold software support agreements is initially recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over or months depending on the term of the support agreement 
deferred revenue includes i payments received for products not yet delivered  ii advance payments on contract revenues  iii payments received for training and consulting 
table of contents services not yet performed  and iv that portion of separately sold software support agreements and subscription based product sales  that has not yet been recognized as revenue 
because software products are generally shipped as orders are received  we have historically operated without a significant backlog of products 
however  it is our practice to announce new products prior to the time at which such products will be ready for shipment to allow customers sufficient lead time for budgeting and curriculum purposes 
this practice can result in a significant backlog for orders of new products 
these orders are generally filled within a relatively short period of time after the product is ready for shipment 
registrations for training seminars are generally received from customers in advance of training events  resulting in a backlog for these services 
additionally  under district wide implementations  customers commit to a comprehensive package of software and professional development services in advance of delivery of the products and services 
the delivery of backlogged products and services in certain periods can cause those periods to have somewhat higher sales and higher sales growth rates than other periods 
cost of sales consists of expenses associated with sales of software products  support agreements  and professional development services 
these costs include i personnel related costs  ii costs of purchased materials such as optical mark card scanners  educational products  training materials  manuals and motivational items  iii shipping and freight costs  iv amortization of capitalized development costs  and v other overhead costs 
we recognize significantly higher gross margins on our product sales than on our service sales 
an optical mark card scanner is included with the sale of all accelerated math site licenses and additional scanners are sold separately 
the gross profit margin on hardware is not as high as the gross profit margin on software 
we began shipping hardware in and as sales of hardware increased  the overall product margin percentage declined in and late in  we began selling our new lower cost scanner which resulted in an increase in the gross profit margin that we realize on hardware sales 
we expense all development costs associated with a software product until technological feasibility is established  after which time such costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers 
capitalized product development costs are amortized into cost of sales using the straight line method over the estimated economic life of the product  which is generally estimated to be months 
in november  our subsidiary  renaissance corporate services  inc  acquired the assets and business of engineering software associates  inc esa  minneapolis  minnesota  a provider of test generation and tutorial software to college textbook publishers

our net sales decreased by million  or  to million in from million in product sales decreased by million  or  to million in from million in in  we experienced revenue declines for nearly all of our products due to the current economic downturn which has resulted in school funding pressures and  consequently  decreased demand for our products 
sales of accelerated reader quizzes and star early literacy software increased somewhat and  together with sales of the new products we introduced in  partially offset the declines in sales of our other products

increased software support and consulting revenues were offset by a decline in our training revenues 
approximately  educators attended our renaissance training programs in compared to approximately  in we believe that school funding pressures will continue into and expect that first quarter revenues will likely be down from the same quarter in further  we believe that the positive impacts of our field sales force expansion  marketing initiatives  and the new products introduced in will result in positive year over year revenue growth in the second half of and  as a result  we expect that revenues for the full year of will be up modestly over cost of sales

as a percentage of net sales  product development costs decreased to in from in we expect product development expenses to continue at approximately these levels for the near term 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses increased by million  or  to million in from million in these expenses increased primarily due to increased costs of selling at the district level  and increased wages and related benefit costs associated with hiring additional personnel to i support sales of our expanded product line and district contracts and ii pursue state and federal funding opportunities

as a percentage of net sales  product development costs decreased to in from in selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses increased by million  or  to million in from million in these expenses increased primarily due to i direct mailings to an increased customer and prospect base  ii increased wages and related benefit costs associated with hiring additional personnel to market and promote a broader product line  iii costs related to selling and marketing our district wide school improvement program  and iv costs of marketing the generation enterprise wide training and knowledge management software

the following represents a summary of our critical accounting policies  defined as those policies that we believe are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and or require management s significant judgments and estimates 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position no 
software revenue recognition issued by the accounting standards executive committee of the aicpa 
under this accounting standard  revenue is recognized when the following have occurred persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  product delivery and acceptance has occurred or a service has been performed  pricing is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is probable 
revenue is recognized as follows i at the time of shipment to customers for off the shelf software products and related telephone support with a duration of months or less sold with the product  ii on the percentage of completion basis for software products which require significant customization or modification  iii as seminars are performed for training  iv straight line over the term of the support agreement for separately sold software support agreements  
table of contents v as the service is performed or on a straight line basis over the contractual period for consulting services  and vi straight line over the subscription period for subscription based products 
accordingly  management is required to make judgements as to whether pricing is fixed and determinable  whether collectibility is reasonably assured and what the percentage of completion is as of the financial reporting date 
expenses are recognized and matched against revenues for the reporting period presented in the financial statements 
we record accruals for sales returns and doubtful accounts at the time of revenue recognition based upon historical experience 
changes in such allowances may be required if future returns or bad debt activity differs from historical experience 
impairment of long lived assets 
we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired 
management uses judgement when applying impairment rules to determine when an impairment test is necessary 
examples of factors which could trigger an impairment review include a significant decrease in the market value of an asset  a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used  and significant adverse changes in legal factors or the business climate that impact the value of an asset 
impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value of an asset exceeds its estimated fair value 
we are required to make estimates of future cash flows related to the asset subject to review 
these forecasts require assumptions about demand for our products and services  future market conditions and technological developments 
other assumptions include determining the discount rate and future growth rates 
changes to these assumptions could result in an impairment charge in future periods 
software support and warranty obligations 
we record a liability for the estimated cost of software support and hardware warranty obligations at the time of sale 
estimated costs are based upon our historical cost experience of fulfilling these obligations as well as other factors that in our judgment could reasonably be expected to affect those costs  such as trends in the cost of providing telephone support and anticipated hardware warranty claim rates 
if the actual costs of fulfilling these obligations differ from our estimates  it could result in additional charges to cost of sales in future periods 
software development costs 
we capitalize certain software development costs incurred after technological feasibility is achieved 
capitalized software development costs are amortized on a product by product basis using the straight line method over the estimated economic life of the products  which is generally estimated to be months 
amortization begins when the products are available for general release to customers 
if the actual economic life of our products is shorter than our estimates  it could result in an impairment charge in future periods 
taxes 
at the end of each interim reporting period  we estimate the effective income tax rate expected to be applicable for the full fiscal year 
the estimated effective income tax rate contemplates the expected jurisdiction where income is earned eg  united states compared to non united states as well as tax planning strategies 
if the actual distribution of taxable income by jurisdiction varies from our expectations or if the results of tax planning strategies are different from our estimates  adjustments to the effective income tax rate may be required in the period such determination is made 
we record a liability for potential tax assessments based on our estimate of the potential exposure 
due to the subjectivity and complex nature of the underlying issues  actual payments or assessments may differ from our estimates and require tax provision adjustments in future periods 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk 
our exposure to market interest rate risk consists of i the increase or decrease in the amount of interest income we can earn on our investment portfolio  and ii the decrease or increase in value of our investment security portfolio if market interest rates increase or decrease  respectively 
we anticipate that we will have sufficient liquidity to hold our investments to maturity  therefore  we do not expect to recognize any material losses or gains related to an increase or decrease in market interest rates 

table of contents market risk 
our exposure to market risk relates to the quality of the holdings in our investment security portfolio 
the fair market value of our investments is subject to increases or decreases in value resulting from the performance of the securities issuer and from upgrades or downgrades in the credit worthiness of the securities issuer 
we seek to manage our exposure to market risk by investing according to our board approved investment policy which has the following goals i preservation of capital  ii provision of adequate liquidity to meet projected cash requirements  iii minimization of risk of principal loss through diversified short and medium term investments  and iv maximization of yields in relationship to the guidelines  risk  market conditions and tax considerations 
our investment policy specifically defines that our investments i have a maximum maturity of months or less  ii meet a minimum portfolio liquidity requirement that of the portfolio shall be available on days notice and not more than of the portfolio will have a maturity in excess of months  iii meet minimum credit quality requirements specified in the plan based on the type of investment  iv meet the concentration limit of not more than in any one issuer other than the us treasury or its agencies  or money market funds  and v meet certain maximum maturity or tender option limits based on its minimum credit rating 
as of december  our investment securities had a market value of approximately  and a carrying value of our investment policy parameters preclude investment in equity securities and require that the board of directors review the policy annually and on an interim basis as required 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the financial position and results of operations of our foreign subsidiaries are measured using local currency 
revenues and expenses of such subsidiaries have been translated into us dollars at average exchange rates prevailing during the period 
assets and liabilities have been translated at the rates of exchange at the balance sheet date 
translation gains or losses are deferred as a separate component of shareholders equity 
aggregate foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in determining net income 
as such  our operating results are affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar compared to the australian dollar  british pound  canadian dollar  and indian rupee 
at this time  foreign operations are not material
