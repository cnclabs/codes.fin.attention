item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the business of famous dave s of america  inc is to develop  operate and or franchise casual dining restaurants under the name famous dave s 
as of december   there were famous dave s restaurants were company owned and operated  and were franchised 
the locations are summarized in the table below company owned franchised total state restaurants restaurants restaurants alabama georgia illinois indiana iowa kentucky maryland minnesota nebraska new jersey north dakota ohio oklahoma south dakota tennessee texas utah virginia wisconsin our company s future additional revenues and profits will depend upon various factors  including additional market acceptance of the famous dave s concept  the quality of the restaurant operations  the ability to successfully expand into new markets  our ability to raise additional financing as required and general economic conditions 
there can be no assurance we will successfully implement our expansion plans  in which case we will continue to be dependent on revenues from existing operations 
we also face all of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered in the development of an expanding business 
furthermore  to the extent that our expansion strategy is successful  we must manage the transition to multiple site and higher volume operations  the control of overhead expenses and the addition and retention of necessary personnel 
components of operating expenses include food and beverage costs  operating payroll and employee benefits  occupancy costs  repair and maintenance  and advertising and promotion 
certain of these costs are variable and will increase with sales volume 
the primary fixed costs are corporate and restaurant management and occupancy costs 
our experience is that when a new restaurant opens  it incurs higher than normal levels of labor and food costs until operations stabilize  usually during the first three months of operation 
as restaurant management and staff gain experience following the opening  labor scheduling  food cost management and operating expense control are improved to levels similar to those at our more established restaurants 
general and administrative expenses include all corporate and administrative functions that serve to support existing operations and provide an infrastructure to support future growth 
management  supervisory and staff salaries  employee benefits  travel  rent  depreciation  general insurance and marketing expenses are major items in this category 
our company has elected a or week fiscal year ending on the sunday nearest december fiscal years  and were all week years 
for and  the fiscal year will be and weeks respectively 
our company was formed in march and we opened our first restaurant in minneapolis in june operating results overall results of operations for the weeks ended december  reflect the opening of eight new company owned units during fiscal our overall operating results for fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal  expressed as a percentage of total revenue  were as follows fiscal years ended december december december revenues unit level costs and expenses food and beverage costs labor and benefits operating expenses depreciation and amortization pre opening expenses total costs and expenses income from unit level operations general and administrative expenses income from operations interest and other income expense gain on sale of property loss from investment in unconsolidated affiliate income loss before taxes benefit from income tax net income loss a breakdown of our restaurant operating results were as follows amounts in s for fiscal year ending restaurant operations total company of of amount revenue amount revenue revenue   unit level costs and expenses food and beverage costs   labor and benefits   operating expenses   depreciation and amortization   pre opening expenses  total costs and expenses   income from unit level operations   for fiscal year ending restaurant operations total company of of amount revenue amount revenue revenue   unit level costs and expenses food and beverage costs   labor and benefits   operating expenses   depreciation and amortization   pre opening expenses total costs and expenses   income from unit level operations   for fiscal year ending restaurant operations total company of of amount revenue amount revenue revenue   unit level costs and expenses food and beverage costs   labor and benefits   operating expenses   depreciation and amortization   pre opening expenses total costs and expenses   income from unit level operations   fiscal year compared to fiscal year total revenues our company s total revenues were  for fiscal  compared to  for fiscal  a increase 
this increase is due to additional restaurant openings  and increased franchising and royalty revenues 
each of these components is further discussed below 
restaurant revenue restaurant revenue increased by  or to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the increase in revenue was due primarily to an additional eight restaurants opened during fiscal  adding to the base of restaurants open as of december  approximately million of additional revenue  the contribution of a full year of revenue from restaurants which were open for only part of approximately million of additional revenue offset by the sale of five company restaurants to franchisees in three separate transactions approximately million less in revenues and a decrease in revenue from restaurants open for all of both periods approximately million 
because of the fiscal restaurant openings  and expected additional restaurant openings in  we anticipate revenue and operating costs and expenses to continue to increase during fiscal during fiscal  we increased menu prices an average of 
other revenue other revenue for our company consists of royalty revenues  franchise fees and initial franchise fees 
franchise revenues for fiscal were  a increase when compared to  for the same period in franchise revenue includes both franchise royalty income and initial franchise fees 
royalties are based on a percent of sales  while fee amounts reflect initial non refundable fixed fees  which are recorded as revenue when an agreement is signed and no additional significant services are required by our company 
there were franchise operated restaurants open at december   compared to at december  our company also receives licensing royalties from a retail line of business  including sauces  seasonings and prepared meats 
for fiscal year  the licensing royalty income was  compared to  for the same period in same store sales it is our policy to include in our same store sales base restaurants that have been open more than months 
at the end of fiscal  there were restaurants included in this base 
same store sales for fiscal decreased approximately  compared to fiscal s increase of approximately 
we believe that the decrease in comparable sales is a result of a difficult economic environment during average weekly sales average weekly volume for all of our company operated restaurants was  during and  for franchise operated restaurants 
average weekly volume for our company operated restaurants was  during and  for franchise operated restaurants 
food and beverage costs food and beverage costs for fiscal were  or of restaurant revenue compared to  or for fiscal an increase in the price of pork products earlier in was offset by decreases in other commodity costs  including beef and chicken 
with lower pork prices already negotiated for the contract  we expect to see a slight decrease in food costs as a percent of restaurant revenues 
labor and benefits labor and benefits were  or of restaurant revenue in fiscal compared to  or of restaurant revenue in fiscal the increase in labor and benefits as a percentage of restaurant revenue is primarily due to decreased efficiencies in scheduling and managing labor hours  increases in benefits costs and additional staffing in preparation for new restaurant openings 
full service restaurants that operate in states without a tip credit such as minnesota experience a higher wage rate for dining room labor than do restaurants located in states where a tip credit is available to reduce wages paid to foodservers 
the migration toward full service dining in most of our restaurants is part of our strategy for increasing unit level revenue  but results in higher labor costs 
operating expenses operating expenses for fiscal were  or of restaurant revenue  compared to  or of restaurant revenue for fiscal the dollar increase in operating expenses was related to the increased number of restaurants 
the increase in operating expenses as a percent of restaurant revenue in fiscal  compared to fiscal  was primarily due to lower average restaurant revenues against slightly higher fixed costs

although income from unit level operations should not be considered an alternative to income loss from operations as a measure of our operating performance  such unit level measurement is commonly used as an additional measure of operating performance in the restaurant industry and certain related industries 
the decrease in income from unit level operations from fiscal to fiscal was primarily attributable to the decrease in average weekly sales and an increase in operating costs of new units opened during fiscal pre opening expenses pre opening expenses were  for compared to  for fiscal these expenses reflect the opening and conversion of eight new restaurants in fiscal compared to six new restaurants in fiscal general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses totaled  or of revenue in fiscal compared to  or of revenue in fiscal the dollar increase reflects an increase in the corporate infrastructure to support recent restaurant growth

the decrease in expense from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to additional interest income received via notes receivable our company holds with franchisees  as well as a decrease in interest expense on our existing borrowings from lower interest rates 
gain on sale of property and other income during fiscal our company recorded a gain on sale of property and other income of  or of revenue

quarterly fluctuations  seasonality and inflation our company restaurants typically generate higher revenues in the second and third quarters and lower revenues in the first and fourth quarters as a result of seasonal traffic increases experienced during the summer months  and possible adverse weather which can disrupt customer and employee transportation to our restaurants 
the primary inflationary factors affecting our operations include food and beverage and labor costs 
in addition  our leases require us to pay taxes  maintenance  repairs and utilities and these costs are subject to inflationary increases 
in addition  we are subject to interest rate changes based on market conditions 
we believe low inflation rates have contributed to relatively stable costs 
there is no assurance  however  that low inflation rates will continue
