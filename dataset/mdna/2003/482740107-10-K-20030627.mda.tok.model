these risks  uncertainties and other factors are discussed throughout this report and specifically under the caption cautionary statement regarding forward looking information and risk factors 
in addition  the following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this form k 
background we develop  acquire  manufacture and market technologically distinguished branded and generic prescription pharmaceutical products 
we also enter into licensing agreements with pharmaceutical marketing companies to develop and commercialize additional brand name products 
until the mid s  we derived most of our revenues from our manufacturing and licensing activities 
today  we derive most of our revenues from our product sales 
while we expect to continue to enter into new licensing agreements  we emphasize the development or acquisition and marketing of technologically distinguished prescription products  whether branded or generic non branded through our ther rx and ethex business lines  as well as specialty raw materials through particle dynamics 
in  we established our ethex business to market and distribute technologically distinguished generic non branded drugs that use our proprietary technologies 
net revenues from ethex have increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal we launched our ther rx business in to market branded pharmaceutical products 
we acquired and introduced our first two of ther rx branded products  micro k r and precare r  in march and august  respectively 
ther rx has also introduced four internally developed product line extensions to precare r since october  including primacare tm in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the first prescription prenatal postnatal nutritional supplement with essential fatty acids specially designed to help provide nutritional support for women during pregnancy  postpartum recovery and throughout the childbearing years 
in june  we launched our first nda approved product  gynazole r  a one dose prescription cream treatment for vaginal yeast infections 
net revenues from ther rx have increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are presented on the basis of accounting principles that are generally accepted in the united states 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management 
as a result  these policies are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
in applying these policies  our management makes estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures 
we base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience  the terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry  information that we obtain from our customers and outside sources  and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
although we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  actual results may differ significantly from these estimates 
changes in estimates and assumptions based upon actual results may have a material impact on our results of operations and or financial condition 
our critical accounting policies are described below 
revenue recognition and sales allowances 
we recognize revenue on product sales upon shipment when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer and when estimated sales provisions for product returns  sales rebates  payment discounts  chargebacks  and other promotional programs are reasonably determinable 
accruals for these provisions are presented in the consolidated financial statements as reductions to revenues and accounts receivable 
provisions for estimated product returns  sales rebates  payment discounts  and other promotional programs require a limited degree of subjectivity  yet combined represent a significant portion of the provisions 
these provisions are estimated based on historical payment experience  historical relationship to revenues  estimated customer inventory levels and contract terms 
such provisions are reasonably determinable due to the limited number of assumptions and consistency of historical experience 
the provision for chargebacks is the most significant and complex estimate used in the recognition of revenue 
we establish contract prices for indirect customers who are supplied by our wholesale customers 
a chargeback represents the difference between our invoice price to the wholesaler and the indirect customer s contract price  which is lower 
we credit the wholesaler for purchases by indirect customers at the lower price 
accordingly  we record these chargebacks at the time we recognize revenue in connection with our sales to wholesalers 
provisions for estimating chargebacks are calculated primarily using historical chargeback experience  actual contract pricing and estimated wholesaler inventory levels 
we continually monitor our assumptions giving consideration to estimated wholesaler inventory levels and current pricing trends and make adjustments to these provisions when we believe that the actual chargeback credits will differ from the estimated provisions 
allowance for inventories 
inventories consist of finished goods held for distribution  raw materials and work in process 
our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined on the first in  first out basis 
in evaluating whether inventory is to be stated at the lower of cost or market  we consider such factors as the amount of inventory on hand and in the distribution channel  estimated time required to sell existing inventory  remaining shelf life and current and expected market conditions  including levels of competition 
we establish reserves  when necessary  for slow moving and obsolete inventories based upon our historical experience and management s assessment of current product demand 
if we determine that inventory is overvalued based upon the above factors  then the necessary provisions to reduce inventories to their net realizable value are made 
intangible assets and goodwill 
our intangible assets consist of product rights  license agreements and trademarks resulting from product acquisitions and legal fees and similar costs relating to the development of patents and trademarks 
intangible assets that are acquired are stated at cost  less accumulated amortization  and are amortized on a straight line basis over estimated useful lives of years 
upon approval  costs associated with the development of patents and trademarks are amortized on a straight line basis over estimated useful lives ranging from five to years 
we determine amortization periods for intangible assets that are acquired based on our assessment of various factors impacting estimated useful lives and cash flows of the acquired products 
such factors include the product s position in its life cycle  the existence or absence of like products in the market  various other competitive and regulatory issues  and contractual terms 
significant changes to any of these factors may result in a reduction in the intangible asset s useful life and an acceleration of related amortization expense 
we assess the impairment of intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
some factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following  significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangible assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we first perform an assessment of the asset s recoverability 
recoverability is determined by comparing the carrying amount of an intangible asset against an estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition 
if the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the intangible asset  an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount over the estimated fair value of the intangible asset 
goodwill relates to the acquisition of our specialty materials segment and is recorded net of accumulated amortization through march  as of april   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which eliminated the amortization of goodwill  resulting in an increase in pretax income of approximately  for the fiscal year ended march  adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 we performed the initial impairment test of our goodwill and determined that no impairment of the recorded goodwill existed 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we will test goodwill for impairment at least annually and more frequently if an event occurs which indicates the goodwill may be impaired 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal net revenues by segment years ended march  change in thousands branded products    as of net revenues specialty generics    as of net revenues specialty materials    as of net revenues other    total net revenues    the increase in branded product sales was due to continued growth of our women s healthcare family of products 
sales from this product group increased million  or  in fiscal gynazole r  our vaginal antifungal product  continued its market penetration as its market share increased to at the end of fiscal  compared to at the end of the prior fiscal year 
due to its continued growth in market share  sales of gynazole r increased million  or during the year 
also included in the women s healthcare family of products is the precare r product line which contributed million of incremental sales in fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to increased sales volume associated with primacare r  a prescription prenatal postnatal multivitamin and mineral supplement with essential fatty acids  which has continued to show growth in market share since its introduction in the fourth quarter of fiscal further  the precare r family of products is currently the leading branded line of prescription prenatal nutritional supplements in the united states 
increased sales from the women s healthcare family of products was partially offset by a million  or  decline in sales from the branded products cardiovascular product line 
the decrease in cardiovascular sales was due to the impact of customer buying during the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year in anticipation of a year end price increase coupled with increased substitution of our generic equivalent products 
the increase in sales for specialty generics resulted primarily from higher sales volume in the cardiovascular  pain management and cough cold product lines  coupled with continued expansion of our other product lines  including gastrointestinal and anti anxiety 
increased sales from these product lines was partially offset by a reduction in sales in our prenatal vitamin product line 
the cardiovascular product line  which comprised of specialty generic sales in fiscal  contributed million of increased sales from existing products and million of incremental sales volume from the april anda approval and subsequent launch of potassium chloride mg 
tablets generic equivalent to k dur r 
sales volume for the pain management product line increased million due to market share gains coupled with the impact of a full year of sales of two products introduced in the prior year 
the remaining million of increased sales volume resulted primarily from new product introductions in the cough cold  gastrointestinal and anti anxiety product lines coupled with a full year of sales on products introduced in the prior year 
we introduced and new specialty generic non branded products in fiscal and  respectively 
the million decline in sales volume for the prenatal product line was primarily attributable to a reduction in the corresponding brand equivalent market 
this market decline was due  in part  to the introduction of primacare r by our branded products segment in the fourth quarter of fiscal the increased sales volume experienced by specialty generics during fiscal was partially offset by million of product price erosion that resulted primarily from normal and expected pricing pressures in the pain management and cough cold product lines 
the decrease in specialty material product sales was primarily due to an unexpected softness in the nutritional supplement market for which the specialty materials segment is a supplier 
gross profit by segment years ended march  change in thousands branded products    as of net revenues specialty generics    as of net revenues specialty materials    as of net revenues other   total gross profit    as of total net revenues the increase in gross profit was attributable to the sales growth experienced by the branded products and specialty generics segments  offset partially by a sales decline in the specialty materials segment 
the higher gross profit percentage was favorably impacted by price increases of branded products that took effect at the beginning of fiscal and higher margins realized on new specialty generic products introduced during the current and prior fiscal years 
the gross profit percentage increases experienced by the branded products and specialty generics segments were partially offset by a decline in the gross profit percentage at the specialty raw materials segment 
this decline resulted from unfavorable cost variances associated with lower production 
research and development years ended march  change in thousands research and development    as of net revenues the increase in research and development expense was primarily due to higher costs associated with the expansion of clinical testing connected to our internal product development efforts and higher personnel expenses related to the growth of our research and development staff 
in fiscal  we expect research and development costs to increase by approximately over fiscal levels 
selling and administrative years ended march  change in thousands selling and administrative    as of net revenues the increase in selling and administrative expense resulted primarily from an increase in specialty generic non branded marketing and promotional expenses  an increase in personnel costs associated with corporate administration and branded products marketing and higher insurance costs 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in legal expenses which resulted from insurance reimbursements of defense costs in the healthpoint litigation 
amortization of intangible assets years ended march  change in thousands amortization of intangible assets   the decrease in amortization of intangible assets was due primarily to the implementation of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which discontinued the amortization of goodwill effective april  see notes and in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
litigation years ended march  change in thousands litigation   n a in september  the company recorded a litigation reserve of million for potential damages associated with the adverse decision made by a federal court in texas to uphold a previously rendered jury verdict in a lawsuit against ethex corporation  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company see note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
operating income years ended march  change in thousands operating income    the decrease in operating income resulted from the million litigation reserve established by us for potential damages associated with a lawsuit 
excluding the effect of the litigation reserve  operating income for fiscal increased million  or  to million 
interest and other income years ended march  change in thousands interest and other income the increase in interest and other income was primarily due to the investment of million of proceeds from the july secondary public offering in short term  highly liquid investments 
provision for income taxes years ended march  change in thousands provision for income taxes    effective tax rate the decline in the effective tax rate was primarily due to an increase in research and development tax credits 
net income years ended march  change in thousands net income    diluted earnings per share the decrease in net income resulted from the million litigation reserve established by us for potential damages associated with a lawsuit 
the impact of the litigation reserve  net of applicable taxes  reduced net income by million 
the more significant percentage decline in earnings per diluted share for fiscal resulted from an increase in weighted average shares outstanding due to the issuance of approximately million shares of class a common stock in the secondary public offering that was completed in july excluding the effect of the litigation reserve  net income for fiscal would have increased million  or  to million  or per diluted share 
fiscal compared to fiscal net revenues by segment years ended march  change in thousands branded products    as of net revenues specialty generics    as of net revenues specialty materials    as of net revenues other   total net revenues    the increase in branded product sales was due to increased sales volume among all product categories 
sales from the women s health care family of products increased million  or  in fiscal included in women s health care is the precare r family of prenatal products  which contributed million of incremental sales in fiscal due to volume related increases in market share 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  ther rx introduced primacare tm  a prescription prenatal postnatal multivitamin and mineral supplement with essential fatty acids 
we also market gynazole r  a vaginal antifungal product introduced in the first quarter of fiscal due to its continued growth in market share  gynazole r sales increased million  or  in fiscal sales from the cardiovascular disease product line increased million  or  in fiscal as customer inventories returned to normal levels 
the increase in specialty generic sales was primarily due to a million increase in the sales volume of existing products coupled with million of incremental sales from new products 
the cardiovascular product line  which comprised of specialty generic sales  accounted for million of the total sales growth 
we introduced new products in fiscal the volume growth experienced by specialty generics was partially offset by million of product price erosion that resulted from normal and expected competitive pricing pressures on certain products 
the increase in specialty raw material product sales was primarily due to sales of new products and increased sales of existing products 
gross profit years ended march  change in thousands gross profit    as of net revenues the increase in gross profit was primarily attributable to the increased level of product sales 
the higher gross profit percentage in fiscal resulted primarily from a shift in the mix of product sales toward higher margin branded products comprising a larger percentage of net revenues and favorable cost variances associated with increased production 
the positive impact of these two factors was partially offset by the price erosion in certain specialty generic products discussed above 
research and development years ended march  change in thousands research and development    as of net revenues the increase in research and development expense was primarily due to higher costs associated with clinical testing connected to our internal product development efforts and higher personnel expenses related to expansion of our research and development staff 
selling and administrative years ended march  change in thousands selling and administrative    as of net revenues the increase in selling and administrative expense was due primarily to an increase in personnel costs associated with corporate administration and branded marketing

the net cash flow from operating activities was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in net cash flow from operating activities resulted primarily from an increase in cash earnings coupled with the receipt of certain delayed customer payments which were due at the end of fiscal and collected during the first quarter of fiscal these increases were offset in part by an increase in inventories due to increased production of specialty generic products in fiscal  in anticipation of continued sales growth and an increase in current liabilities due to an increase in accounts payable related to purchases to support our production increases and the timing of income tax payments 
net cash flow used in investing activities was million for fiscal compared to million for the prior year 
capital expenditures of million were funded by net cash flows from operating activities 
our investment in capital assets was primarily for purchasing machinery and equipment to upgrade and expand our pharmaceutical manufacturing and distribution capabilities  and for other building renovations 
other investing activities for the year included a million payment related to the purchase of certain licensing rights combined with an equity investment in a women s healthcare company 
also  on march   we completed the purchase of product rights and trademarks to the chromagen r and strongstart r product lines from a subsidiary of altana pharma ag altana and the niferex r product line from schwarz pharma 
the acquisition of the chromagen r and strongstart r product lines was financed with a million cash payment made on march  and two non interest bearing million promissory notes issued to altana  which are due on the first and second anniversaries of the agreement 
a cash payment of million was made in april for the niferex r product line 
total debt increased to million at march  compared to million at march  the increase resulted from the issuance of two non interest bearing million promissory notes to altana as partial funding for the chromagen r and strongstart r product line acquisitions on march  the two notes are due on the first and second anniversaries of the agreement 
the promissory notes  which are non interest bearing  were discounted using imputed interest rates of and  respectively  both of which approximate the company s borrowing rate for similar debt instruments at the time of the borrowing 
the present value of the notes was determined to be million  resulting in a discount of million 
in december  the company refinanced a million building mortgage that was due in march the refinanced building mortgage bears interest at and is due in december as of march   we have a credit agreement with a bank that provides for a revolving line of credit for borrowing up to million 
the credit agreement provides for a million unsecured revolving line of credit along with an unsecured supplemental credit line of million for financing acquisitions 
the million unsecured revolving line of credit expires in october the unsecured supplemental credit line of million  which was renewed in december  expires in december at march   we had no borrowings outstanding under either credit facility and million in open letters of credit issued under the revolving credit line 
during july  we completed a public offering of approximately million shares of class a common stock 
net proceeds to us were million  after deducting underwriting discounts  commissions and offering expenses 
the proceeds from the offering are being used for general corporate purposes  including product acquisitions  research and development activities and working capital 
at march   the net proceeds were temporarily invested in short term  highly liquid instruments 
on april   we purchased a building for million 
the facility consists of approximately  square feet of office  production  distribution and warehouse space 
the purchase of the building was financed by a term loan secured by the property 
the building mortgage bears interest at and requires monthly principal payments of  plus interest through march the remaining principal balance plus any unpaid interest is due in april during may  we completed the issuance of million of contingent convertible subordinated notes the notes that are convertible  under certain circumstances  into shares of our class a common stock at an initial conversion price of per share 
the notes bear interest at a rate of and mature on may  we may redeem some or all of the notes at any time on or after may   at a redemption price  payable in cash  of of the principal amount of the notes  plus accrued and unpaid interest including contingent interest  if any to the date of redemption 
holders may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes on may     and  and upon a change in control  as defined in the indenture governing the notes  at of the principal amount of the notes  plus accrued and unpaid interest including contingent interest  if any to the date of repurchase  payable in cash 
the notes are subordinate to all of our existing and future senior obligations 
the net proceeds to us were approximately million  after deducting underwriting discounts  commissions and offering expenses 
the proceeds from the offering were used to purchase million of our class a common stock  with the remaining proceeds to be used to fund future acquisitions of products  technologies or businesses  and for general corporate purposes 
as a result of the significant increase in debt related to the million notes issuance  the million revolving line of credit we have with a bank was changed 
the credit agreement  which previously included covenants that impose minimum levels of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  a maximum funded debt ratio  and a limit on capital expenditures and dividend payments  was expanded to include a minimum fixed charge ratio and a maximum senior leverage ratio 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations in thousands and total thereafter obligations at march  long term debt      operating leases       other long term liabilities   total obligations at march        events subsequent to march  building mortgage   convertible notes   total contractual cash obligations       we believe our cash and cash equivalents balance  cash flows from operations  funds available under our credit facilities  proceeds received from our secondary public offering of class a common stock completed during july and proceeds received from our notes offering completed in may will be adequate to fund operating activities for the presently foreseeable future  including the payment of short term and long term debt obligations  capital improvements  research and development expenditures  product development activities and expansion of marketing capabilities for the branded pharmaceutical business 
in addition  we continue to examine opportunities to expand our business through the acquisition of or investment in companies  technologies  product rights  research and development and other investments that are compatible with our existing businesses 
we intend to use our available cash to help in funding any acquisitions or investments 
as such  cash has been invested in short term  highly liquid instruments 
we also may use funds available under our credit facility  or financing sources that subsequently become available  including the future issuances of additional debt or equity securities  to fund these acquisitions or investments 
if we were to fund one or more such acquisitions or investments  our capital resources  financial condition and results of operations could be materially impacted in future periods 
inflation inflation may apply upward pressure on the cost of goods and services used by us in the future 
however  we believe that the net effect of inflation on our operations during the past three years has been minimal 
in addition  changes in the mix of products sold and the effect of competition has made a comparison of changes in selling prices less meaningful relative to changes in the overall rate of inflation over the past three years
