smith commercial realty lp cescr and the resulting consolidation of cescr s operations 
see supplemental information  page  for condensed pro forma operating results for the year ended december  giving effect to the cescr acquisition as if it had occurred on january  critical accounting policies in preparing the consolidated financial statements management has made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that management believes are critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of the company s accounting policies included in note to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
real estate real estate is carried at cost  net of accumulated depreciation and amortization 
as of december   the company s carrying amount of its real estate  net of accumulated depreciation is billion 
maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred 
depreciation requires an estimate by management of the useful life of each property as well as an allocation of the costs associated with a property to its various components 
if the company does not allocate these costs appropriately or incorrectly estimates the useful lives of its real estate  depreciation expense may be misstated 
upon acquisitions of real estate  the company assesses the fair value of acquired assets including land  buildings  tenant improvements and acquired above and below market leases and the origination cost of acquired in place leases in accordance with sfas no 
and acquired liabilities  and allocate purchase price based on these assessments 
the company assesses fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information 
estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results  known trends  and market economic conditions that may affect the property 
the company s properties are reviewed for impairment if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
if the company incorrectly estimates the values at acquisition or the undiscounted cash flows  initial allocations of purchase price and future impairment charges may be different 
the impact of the company s estimates in connection with acquisitions and future impairment analysis could be material to the company s financial statements 
notes and mortgage loans receivable the company evaluates the collectibility of both interest and principal of each of its notes and mortgage loans receivable million as of december  if circumstances warrant to determine whether it is impaired 
if the company fails to identify that the investee or borrower are unable to perform  the company s bad debt expense may be different 
partially owned entities the company accounts for its investments in partially owned entities million as of december  under the equity method when the company s ownership interest is more than but less than and the company does not exercise direct or indirect control 
when partially owned investments are in partnership form  the threshold may be reduced 
factors that the company considers in determining whether or not it exercises control include substantive participating rights of partners on significant business decisions  including dispositions and acquisitions of assets  financing and operating and capital budgets  board and management representation and authority and other contractual rights of its partners 
to the extent that the company is deemed to control these entities  these entities would have to be consolidated and therefore impact the balance sheet  operations and related ratios 
on a periodic basis the company evaluates whether there are any indicators that the value of the company s investments in partially owned entities are impaired 
an investment is impaired if management s estimate of the value of the investment is less than the carrying amount 
the ultimate realization of the company s investment in partially owned entities is dependent on a number of factors including the performance of the investee and market conditions 
if the company determines that a decline in the value of its investee is other than temporary  then an impairment charge would be recorded 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company periodically evaluates the collectibility of amounts due from tenants and maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make required payments under the lease agreement 
the company also maintains an allowance for receivables arising from the straight lining of rents 
this receivable arises from earnings recognized in excess of amounts currently due under the lease agreements 
management exercises judgment in establishing these allowances and considers payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates 
if estimates differ from actual results this would impact reported results 
revenue recognition the company has the following revenue sources and revenue recognition policies base rents income arising from tenant leases 
these rents are recognized over the non cancelable term of the related leases on a straight line basis which includes the effects of rent steps and free rent abatements under the leases 
percentage rents income arising from retail tenant leases which are contingent upon the sales of the tenant exceeding a defined threshold 
these rents are recognized in accordance with sab  which states that this income is to be recognized only after the contingency has been removed ie sales thresholds have been achieved 
hotel revenues income arising from the operation of the hotel pennsylvania which consists of rooms revenue  food and beverage revenue  and banquet revenue 
income is recognized when rooms are occupied 
food and beverage and banquet revenue are recognized when the services have been rendered 
trade show revenues income arising from the operation of trade shows  including rentals of booths 
this revenue is recognized in accordance with the booth rental contracts when the trade shows have occurred 
expense reimbursement income income arising from tenant leases which provide for the recovery of all or a portion of the operating expenses and real estate taxes of the respective property 
this income is accrued in the same periods as the expenses are incurred 
before the company recognizes revenue  it assesses among other things  its collectibility 
if the company incorrectly determines the collectibility of its revenue  its net income and assets could be overstated 
income taxes the company operates in a manner intended to enable it to continue to qualify as a real estate investment trust reit under sections of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
under those sections  a reit which distributes at least of its reit taxable income as a dividend to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions will not be taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders 
the company intends to distribute to its shareholders of its taxable income 
therefore  no provision for federal income taxes is required 
if the company fails to distribute the required amount of income to its shareholders  it would fail to qualify as a reit and substantial adverse tax consequences may result

the company is reviewing various alternatives for the repayment or refinancing of debt coming due during the company has billion available under its revolving credit facility which matures in july and a number of properties which are unencumbered 
the company s credit facility contains customary conditions precedent to borrowing such as the bring down of customary representations and warranties as well as compliance with financial covenants such as minimum interest coverage and maximum debt to market capitalization 
the facility provides for higher interest rates in the event of a decline in the company s ratings below baa bbb

the company carries comprehensive liability and all risk property insurance fire  flood  extended coverage and rental loss insurance with respect to its assets 
the company s all risk insurance policies in effect before september  do not expressly exclude coverage for hostile acts  except for acts of war 
since september   insurance companies have for the most part excluded terrorist acts from coverage in all risk policies

in  the company obtained  of separate coverage for terrorist acts for each of its new york city office  washington  dc office  retail and merchandise mart businesses and  for its temperature controlled logistics business

the company s debt instruments  consisting of mortgage loans secured by its properties which are generally non recourse to the company  its senior unsecured notes due and its revolving credit agreement  contain customary covenants requiring the company to maintain insurance 
there can be no assurance that the lenders under these instruments will not take the position that an exclusion from all risk insurance coverage for losses due to terrorist acts is a breach of these debt instruments that allows the lenders to declare an event of default and accelerate repayment of debt 
the company has received correspondence from four lenders regarding terrorism insurance coverage  which the company has responded to 
in these letters the lenders took the position that under the agreements governing the loans provided by these lenders the company was required to maintain terrorism insurance on the properties securing the various loans 
the aggregate amount of borrowings under these loans as of december  was approximately million  and there was no additional borrowing capacity 
subsequently  the company obtained an aggregate of million of separate coverage for terrorist acts 
to date  one of the lenders has acknowledged to the company that it will not raise any further questions based on the company s terrorism insurance coverage in place  and the other three lenders have not raised any further questions regarding the company s insurance coverage 
if lenders insist on greater coverage for these risks  it could adversely affect the company s ability to finance and or refinance its properties and to expand its portfolio 
on november   the terrorism risk insurance act of was signed into law 
under this new legislation  through with a possible extension through  regulated insurers must offer coverage in their commercial property and casualty policies including existing policies for losses resulting from defined acts of terrorism

as a result of the legislation  in february the company obtained million of per occurrence coverage for terrorist acts for its new york city office  washington  dc office and merchandise mart businesses  of which million is for certified acts  as defined in the legislation 
the company maintains million and million of separate aggregate coverage that it had in for each of its retail and temperature controlled logistics businesses which has been renewed as of january  
the company s current retail property insurance carrier has advised the company that there will be an additional premium of approximately  per month through the end of the policy term june  for acts of terrorism coverage  as defined in the new legislation and that the situation may change upon renewal 
in addition  many of the company s non recourse mortgages contain debt service covenants which if not satisfied could require cash collateral 
these covenants are not ratings related

 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets 
the company s goodwill balance on december  of  consisted of  related to the hotel pennsylvania acquisition and  related to the acquisition of the temperature controlled logistics businesses 
prior to january   the company performed impairment testing in accordance with sfas the company reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
given the decrease in the estimated market values and the deteriorating performance of hotel pennsylvania and temperature controlled logistics  the company performed a review for recoverability estimating the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition 
as of december   the sum of the expected cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges exceeded the carrying amounts of goodwill  and therefore no impairments were recognized 
upon adoption of sfas on january   the company tested the goodwill for impairment at the reporting level unit utilizing the prescribed two step method 
the first step compared the fair value of the reporting unit determined based on a discounted cash flow approach with its carrying amount 
as the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeded its fair value  the second step of the impairment test was performed to measure the impairment loss 
the second step compared the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of the goodwill 
as the carrying amounts of the goodwill exceeded the fair values  on january  the company wrote off all of the goodwill of the hotel and the temperature controlled logistics business as an impairment loss totaling  the write off has been reflected as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle on the income statement 
earnings allocable to the minority interest has been reduced by their pro rata share of the write off of goodwill 
previously reported income before gains on sale of real estate and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle and net income applicable to common shares for the year ended december  would have been approximately  higher  or and per diluted share  if such goodwill was not amortized in the prior year

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates 
market interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  beyond the control of the company 
various financial vehicles exist which would allow management to mitigate the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the company s cash flows and earnings 
as of december  the company has entered into an interest rate swap described in footnote to the table below 
management may engage in additional hedging strategies in the future  depending on management s analysis of the interest rate environment and the costs and risks of such strategies 
the company s exposure to a change in interest rates on its wholly owned and partially owned debt all of which arises out of non trading activity is as follows in thousands  except per share amounts weighted effect of weighted december  average change in december  average balance interest rate base rates balance interest rate wholly owned debt variable rate    fixed rate   debt of partially owned entities variable rate    fixed rate   minority interest  total decrease in the company s annual net income  per share diluted

in accordance with sfas  as amended  accounting for these swaps requires the company to fair value the debt at each reporting period 
at december   the fair value adjustment was  and is included in the balance of the senior unsecured notes above 
the effect of a change in wholly owned debt base rates shown above excludes  of variable rate mortgage financing  cross collateralized by the company s broadway and madison avenue office properties  as the proceeds are held in a restricted mortgage escrow account which bears interest at the same rate as the loans 
the effect of a change in partially owned debt base rates shown above is calculated after including  representing the company s share of prime group realty lp s pge outstanding variable rate debt as at september  pge has not filed its annual report on form k for the year ended december   prior to the filing of this annual report on form k 
the fair value of the company s debt  based on discounted cash flows at the current rate at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings for the remaining term of such debt  exceeds the aggregate carrying amount by approximately  at december
