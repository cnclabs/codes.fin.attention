item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations of northern border pipeline company update on the impact of enron s chapter filing on northern border pipeline s business 
the northern border pipeline system is operated by northern plains pursuant to an operating agreement 
as of december   northern plains employed approximately individuals located at northern plains headquarters in omaha  nebraska  and at various locations along the pipeline route 
northern plains also used employees and information technology systems of its affiliates to provide its services 
northern plains employees are not represented by any labor union and are not covered by any collective bargaining agreements 
the northern border pipeline system northern border pipeline owns a  mile interstate pipeline system that transports natural gas from the montana saskatchewan border near port of morgan  montana to natural gas markets in the midwestern united states 
construction of the northern border pipeline system was initially completed in the northern border pipeline system was expanded and or extended in   and the northern border pipeline system connects directly and through multiple pipelines to various natural gas markets in the united states 
the northern border pipeline system consists of miles of inch diameter pipe from the canadian border to ventura  iowa capable of transporting a total of  million cubic feet per day mmcfd  inch diameter pipe and inch diameter pipe  each approximately miles in length  capable of transporting  mmcfd in total from ventura  iowa to harper  iowa  miles of inch diameter pipe and miles of inch diameter pipe capable of transporting mmcfd from harper  iowa to manhattan  illinois chicago area  and miles of inch diameter pipe capable of transporting mmcfd from manhattan  illinois to a terminus near north hayden  indiana 
along the pipeline there are compressor stations with total rated horsepower of  and measurement facilities to support the receipt and delivery of natural gas at various points 
other facilities include four field offices and a microwave communication system with tower sites 
the northern border pipeline system has pipeline access to natural gas reserves in the western canadian sedimentary basin in the provinces of alberta  british columbia and saskatchewan in canada  domestic natural gas produced within the williston basin and synthetic gas produced at the dakota gasification plant in north dakota 
in addition  the northern border pipeline system is capable of physically receiving natural gas at two locations near chicago 
at its northern end  the northern border pipeline system s natural gas supplies are received through an interconnection with transcanada s majority owned foothills pipe lines sask 
ltd 
system in canada  which is connected to transcanada s alberta system and the pipeline system owned by transgas limited in saskatchewan 
also  at the north end  the northern border pipeline system connects to a domestic natural gas gathering system owned by encana corporation 
in north dakota  the northern border pipeline system connects with facilities of northern natural gas company at buford  which facilities in turn are connected to williston basin interstate pipeline and the gathering system owned by bear paw energy  llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of northern border partners 
other locations in north dakota where the northern border pipeline system can receive gas are interconnections with williston basin interstate pipeline at glen ullin  and amerada hess corporation at watford city and facilities of dakota gasification company at hebron 
near its terminus  the northern border pipeline system is capable of physically receiving natural gas from northern illinois gas company at troy grove  illinois and from midwestern gas transmission company  a wholly owned subsidiary of northern border partners at channahon  illinois 
for the year ended december   of the natural gas transported on the northern border pipeline system  approximately was produced in canada  approximately was produced by the dakota gasification plant and approximately was produced in the williston basin 
interconnects the northern border pipeline system connects with multiple pipelines of various interstate  intrastate and local distribution companies that provide its shippers with access to the various natural gas markets served by those pipelines 
the northern border pipeline system interconnects with pipeline facilities of northern natural gas company at ventura  iowa  as well as multiple smaller interconnections in south dakota  minnesota and iowa  natural gas pipeline company of america at harper  iowa  midamerican energy company at iowa city and davenport  iowa and cordova  illinois  alliant power company at prophetstown  illinois  northern illinois gas company at troy grove and minooka  illinois  midwestern gas transmission company near channahon  illinois  anr pipeline company near manhattan  illinois  vector pipeline lp in will county  illinois  guardian pipeline  llc  an affiliate of northern border partners  in will county  illinois  the peoples gas light and coke company near manhattan  illinois  and northern indiana public service company near north hayden  indiana at the terminus of the northern border pipeline system 
several market centers where natural gas transported on the northern border pipeline system is sold  traded and received for transport to significant consuming markets in the midwest and to interconnecting pipeline facilities  have developed on the northern border pipeline system 
the largest of these market centers is at northern border pipeline s ventura  iowa connection with northern natural gas company 
two other market center locations are the harper  iowa connection with natural gas pipeline company of america and northern border pipeline system s multiple interconnects in the chicago area that include connections with northern illinois gas company  the peoples gas light and coke company and northern indiana public service company  as well as four interstate pipelines 
shippers the northern border pipeline system serves more than firm transportation shippers with diverse operating and financial profiles 
based upon shippers contractual obligations  as of december   of the firm capacity is contracted by producers and marketers 
the remaining firm capacity is contracted to local distribution companies  interstate pipelines and end users 
as of december   the termination dates of these contracts ranged from march  to december   and the weighted average contract life  based upon annual contractual obligations  was approximately four and one half years 
contracts for approximately of the capacity will expire during see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations of northern border pipeline company outlook 
northern border pipeline s mix and number of shippers may change throughout the year as a result of its shippers utilizing northern border pipeline s capacity release provisions that allow shippers to release all or part of their capacity to other shippers either permanently for the full term of their contract or temporarily 
under the terms of northern border pipeline s tariff  a temporary capacity release does not relieve the original contract shipper from its payment obligations if the replacement shipper fails to pay 
shippers on the northern border pipeline system temporarily released capacity during for varying periods of time 
there were also permanent releases of capacity to other shippers for the full term of the contracts 
as of december   the largest shipper  pan alberta gas us pan alberta is obligated for approximately of the contracted firm capacity  of which approximately of the total contracted capacity has been temporarily released by pan alberta to other shippers through october  pan alberta s firm contracts expire october  mirant americas energy marketing  lp  who manages the assets of pan alberta gas  ltd  including pan alberta s contracts with northern border pipeline  is also obligated for approximately of the contracted firm capacity 
mirant s firm contracts expire in october and december mirant and pan alberta have agreed to maintain credit support in accordance with northern border pipeline s tariff  including letters of credit  that mitigate a portion of northern border pipeline s credit exposure 
the only other shipper that held over of the contracted firm capacity at december  is bp canada energy marketing corp  with approximately of the contracted firm capacity  of which approximately of the total contracted capacity expires on october  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations of northern border pipeline company outlook 
demand for transportation capacity northern border pipeline s long term financial condition is dependent on the continued availability of economic western canadian natural gas supplies for import into the united states 
natural gas reserves may require significant capital expenditures by others for exploration and development drilling and the installation of production  gathering  storage  transportation and other facilities that permit natural gas to be produced and delivered to pipelines that interconnect with the interstate pipelines systems 
low prices for natural gas  regulatory limitations or the lack of available capital for these projects could adversely affect the development of additional reserves and production  gathering  storage and pipeline transmission of western canadian natural gas supplies 
additional pipeline export capacity also could accelerate depletion of these reserves 
furthermore  the availability of export capacity could also affect the demand or value of the transportation capacity on the northern border pipeline system 
northern border pipeline s business also depends on the level of demand for natural gas in the markets the pipeline system serves 
the volumes of natural gas delivered to these markets from other sources affect the demand for both the natural gas supplies and the use of the northern border pipeline system 
demand for natural gas to serve other markets also influences the ability and willingness of shippers to use the northern border pipeline system to meet demand in the markets that it serves 
a variety of factors could affect the demand for natural gas in the markets that the northern border pipeline system serves 
these factors include economic conditions  fuel conservation measures  alternative energy requirements and prices  gas storage inventory levels  climatic conditions  government regulation  and technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices 
interstate pipelines primary exposure to market risk occurs at the time existing transportation contracts expire and are subject to renegotiation 
a key determinant of the value that customers can realize from firm transportation on a pipeline system is the basis differential or market price spread between two points on the pipeline 
the difference in natural gas prices between the points along the pipeline where natural gas enters and where natural gas is delivered represents the gross margin that a customer can expect to achieve from holding transportation capacity at any point in time 
this margin and its variability become important factors in determining the transportation rate customers are willing to pay when they renegotiate their transportation contracts 
the basis differential between markets can be affected by trends in production  available capacity  storage inventories  weather and general market demand in the respective areas 
tc pipelines cannot predict whether these or other factors will have an adverse effect on demand for use of the northern border pipeline system or how significant such adverse effect could be 
interstate pipeline competition northern border pipeline competes with other pipeline companies that transport natural gas from the western canadian sedimentary basin or that transport natural gas to end use markets in the midwest 
northern border pipeline s competitive position is affected by the availability of canadian natural gas for export  the availability of other sources of natural gas and demand for natural gas in the united states 
demand for transportation services on the northern border pipeline system is affected by natural gas prices  the relationship between export capacity from and production in the western canadian sedimentary basin and natural gas shipped from producing areas in the united states 
shippers of natural gas produced in the western canadian sedimentary basin also have other options to transport canadian natural gas to the united states  including transportation on the alliance pipeline  on transcanada s pipeline system  through various interconnects with us interstate pipelines or to markets on the west coast 
the alliance pipeline competes directly with northern border pipeline in the transportation of natural gas from the western canadian sedimentary basin to the chicago area 
because it transports liquids rich natural gas  the alliance pipeline has no interconnections with other pipelines upstream of the liquids extraction facilities  which are located near chicago 
this contrasts with the northern border pipeline system  which serves various markets through interconnections with other pipelines along its route 
the competitive impact of the alliance pipeline in the chicago area has been mitigated by the continuing development of additional capacity to ship natural gas from the chicago area to other markets in the united states 
vector pipeline lp interconnects with the alliance pipeline and transports gas eastward to a terminus in eastern canada 
guardian pipeline was placed into service in december and interconnects with northern border pipeline 
guardian pipeline delivers into markets in wisconsin and could provide access to additional markets for northern border pipeline s shippers 
natural gas is also produced in the united states and transported by competing pipeline systems to the same markets as those served by the northern border pipeline system 
ferc regulation northern border pipeline is subject to extensive regulation by the ferc as a natural gas company under the natural gas act 
under the natural gas act and the natural gas policy act  the ferc has jurisdiction with respect to virtually all aspects of northern border pipeline s business  including transportation of natural gas  rates and charges  construction of new facilities  extension or abandonment of service and facilities  accounts and records  depreciation and amortization policies  the acquisition and disposition of facilities  and the initiation and discontinuation of services 
where required  northern border pipeline holds certificates of public convenience and necessity issued by the ferc covering its facilities  activities and services 
under section of the natural gas act  the ferc has the power to prescribe the accounting treatment for items for regulatory purposes 
northern border pipeline s books and records may be periodically audited under section northern border pipeline was notified in november that it is one of the companies selected by the ferc to undergo an industry wide audit of ferc assessed annual charges 
the overall audit objective is to determine compliance with ferc accounting requirements and regulations as they relate to the calculation and assessment of annual charges by validating the accuracy of the data filed annually with the ferc 
the audit covers the period of january  to december  based on northern border pipeline s discussion with the ferc  the ferc is intending to issue its final report by the end of the second quarter of northern border pipeline advises that it does not believe the results of the audit will have a material adverse impact on its results of operations or financial position 
the ferc regulates the rates and charges for transportation in interstate commerce 
natural gas companies may not charge rates exceeding rates judged just and reasonable by the ferc 
generally  rates are based on the cost of service including recovery of and a return on the pipeline s actual historical cost investment 
in addition  the ferc prohibits natural gas companies from unduly preferring or unreasonably discriminating against any person with respect to pipeline rates or terms and conditions of service 
some types of rates may be discounted without further ferc authorization and rates may be negotiated subject to ferc approval 
the rates and terms and conditions for northern border pipeline s service are found in its ferc approved gas tariff 
transportation rates are established periodically in ferc proceedings known as rate cases 
under northern border pipeline s tariff  northern border pipeline is allowed to charge for its services on the basis of stated transportation rates established in northern border pipeline s rate case 
northern border pipeline may also provide services under negotiated and discounted rates 
approximately of the agreed upon cost of service or revenue level is attributed to demand charges 
firm shippers that contract for the stated transportation rate are obligated to pay a monthly demand charge  regardless of the amount of natural gas they actually transport  for the term of their contracts 
the remaining of the agreed upon revenue level is attributed to commodity charges based on the volumes of natural gas actually transported 
under the terms of settlement in northern border pipeline s rate case  neither northern border pipeline s existing shippers nor northern border pipeline can seek rate changes until november   at which time northern border pipeline must file a new rate case 
prior to the new rate case  northern border pipeline will not be permitted to increase rates if costs increase  nor will northern border pipeline be required to reduce rates based on cost savings 
as a result  northern border pipeline s earnings and cash flow will depend on future costs  contracted capacity  the volumes of natural gas transported and northern border pipeline s ability to recontract capacity at acceptable rates 
until new transportation rates are approved by ferc  northern border pipeline continues to depreciate its transmission plant at the ferc approved annual depreciation rate 
northern border pipeline s annual depreciation rate on transmission plant in service is 
in order to avoid a decline in transportation rates set in future rate cases as a result of accumulated depreciation  northern border pipeline must maintain or increase its rate base by acquiring or constructing assets that replace or add to existing pipeline facilities or by adding new facilities 
in northern border pipeline s rate case  the ferc addressed the issue of whether the federal income tax allowance included in northern border pipeline s proposed cost of service was reasonable in light of previous ferc rulings 
in those rulings  the ferc held that an interstate pipeline is not entitled to a tax allowance for income attributable to limited partnership interests held by individuals 
the settlement of northern border pipeline s rate case provided that until at least december  northern border pipeline could continue to calculate the allowance for income taxes in the manner it had historically used 
in addition  a settlement adjustment mechanism was implemented  which effectively reduced the return on rate base 
these provisions of the rate case were maintained in the settlement of northern border pipeline s rate case 
northern border pipeline also provides interruptible transportation service 
interruptible transportation service is transportation in circumstances when capacity is available after satisfying firm service requests 
the maximum rate that may be charged to interruptible shippers is calculated as the sum of the firm transportation maximum reservation charge and commodity rate 
under northern border pipeline s tariff  northern border pipeline shares net interruptible transportation service revenue and any new services revenue on an equal basis with northern border pipeline s firm shippers through october  however  northern border pipeline is permitted to retain revenue from interruptible transportation service to offset any decontracted firm capacity 
northern border pipeline is subject to the requirements of ferc order nos 
and  which prohibit preferential treatment by interstate natural gas pipelines of their marketing affiliates and govern how information may be provided to those marketing affiliates 
in september  the ferc issued a notice of proposed rulemaking proposing new standards of conduct that would apply uniformly to natural gas pipelines and transmitting public utilities 
ferc is proposing one set of standards to govern relationships between regulated transmission providers and all energy affiliates 
should a final rule be issued in this proceeding  northern border pipeline may be subject to standards that could result in additional costs 
on august   ferc issued a notice of proposed rulemaking regarding the regulation of cash management and is proposing to establish limits on the amount of funds that can be transferred from the regulated subsidiary to its non regulated parent 
it is not expected that ferc proposed policy will have an impact on the cash management practices of northern border pipeline 
on july   ferc issued a notice of inquiry concerning natural gas pipeline negotiated rate policies and practices 
in this proceeding the ferc is evaluating its negotiated rate program and has invited all segments of the industry to provide comments 
the outcome of this inquiry may change the existing ferc policy concerning the types of negotiated rates that it allows and may have an undetermined impact on the pricing practices for a pipeline s transportation services 
recent ferc orders in proceedings involving other natural gas pipelines have addressed certain aspects of the pipelines creditworthiness provisions set forth in their tariffs 
in addition  industry groups such as the north american energy standards board are studying creditworthiness standards and may recommend that the ferc promulgate changes in such standards on an industry wide basis 
the enactment of some of these recommendations may have the effect of easing certain creditworthiness standards and parameters currently reflected in northern border pipeline s tariff 
at this stage of the proceedings  however  northern border pipeline advises that it cannot predict the ultimate impact  if any  such changes would have on northern border pipeline 
from time to time  northern border pipeline files to make changes to its tariff to clarify provisions  to reflect current industry practices and to reflect recent ferc rulings 
in february  northern border pipeline filed to amend the definition of company use gas  which is gas supplied by its shippers for its operations  to clarify the language by adding detail to the broad categories that comprise company use gas 
relying upon the currently effective version of the tariff  northern border pipeline included in its collection of company use gas  quantities that were equivalent to the cost of electric power at its electric driven compressor stations during the period of june through january several parties have filed protests of this change and have requested that the ferc order refunds 
at its meeting on march   the ferc voted to reject northern border pipeline s filing and require refunds 
in its draft order  the ferc directed northern border pipeline to cease collecting electric costs through its company use gas provisions and to refund with interest  within days  all electric costs that had been collected through northern border pipeline s company use gas provisions 
other parties and northern border pipeline will have thirty days from the date of order to request rehearing 
a reserve in the amount of million was established tc pipelines share equates to million 
northern border pipeline advises that it believes this reserve is sufficient to cover the potential refunds 
environmental and safety matters northern border pipeline s operations are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to safety and the protection of the environment  which include the resource conservation and recovery act  the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of  as amended  clean air act  as amended  the clean water act  as amended  the natural gas pipeline safety act of  as amended  and the pipeline safety act of the pipeline safety improvement act act was signed into law in december the act contains numerous provisions that increase federal inspection and safety requirements for the pipelines 
as a result  the secretary of transportation and various government agencies are required to develop and implement regulations under the act in order for the pipelines to carry out the prescribed evaluations and implementation of programs to ensure the safety of its facilities 
the act and subsequent regulations have prescribed timelines and the implementation may have an impact on the costs that northern border pipeline incurs 
although tc pipelines believes that northern border pipeline s operations and facilities are in general compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental and safety regulations  risks of substantial costs and liabilities are inherent in pipeline operations  and tc pipelines cannot provide any assurances that northern border pipeline will not incur such costs and liabilities 
moreover  it is possible that other developments  such as increasingly strict environmental and safety laws  regulations and enforcement policies thereunder  and claims for damages to property or persons resulting from northern border pipeline s operations  could result in substantial costs and liabilities to northern border pipeline 
if northern border pipeline is unable to recover such resulting costs  earnings and cash distributions could be adversely affected
