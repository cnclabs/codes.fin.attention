table of contents industry background today s manufacturers face more challenges than ever 
economic constraints  such as labor and direct material costs  pressure from up stream manufacturers  increased customer demands  and faster delivery requirements are ongoing problems 
at the same time  manufacturers must be able to manage plant operations  standardize manufacturing processes  synchronize activities  provide cross operation visibility  comply with customer requirements  and monitor performance all across the organization 
manufacturers can improve their operations and competitiveness by addressing key business drivers such as reducing the time it takes to manufacture products  speeding time to market for new products  cutting operations costs  exceeding customer expectations  managing multiple sites and worldwide operations  streamlining outsourcing processes  and improving visibility into business performance 
successful manufacturers require an efficient supply chain  distributed manufacturing resources  and automated methods of interacting with suppliers and customers 
growth  customer satisfaction  and profitability for these manufacturers depend on an accurate and rapid flow of information within an integrated supply chain and extended enterprise systems that link suppliers  customers  and the manufacturer 
historically  manufacturers have focused on operations within their own four walls  relying on erp systems to streamline business processes and coordinate internal resources 
these systems typically provide applications to support engineering data management  sales management  purchasing  inventory management  manufacturing control  distribution  transportation  finance  customer relationship management  and many other specialized business functions 
however  in order to compete more effectively manufacturers are increasingly required to extend the automation of business processes within the enterprise to their external supply chain  linking operations with suppliers and customers 
manufacturers must be able to implement these extended enterprise systems rapidly with minimal disruption to their businesses and maintain them with limited information technology resources 
the systems may need to scale to accommodate expansion of the manufacturer s business through growth  acquisition  and organizational changes 
today s manufacturers seek solutions comprised of both product and services 
in addition  they are focused on maximizing the effectiveness of their existing technology investments  while adding functionality that can deliver a rapid return on investment
