competition may limit our ability to acquire hospitals and clinics and adversely affect our growth 
we have historically faced limited competition in acquiring specialty hospitals and outpatient rehabilitation clinics  but we may face heightened competition in the future 
our competitors may acquire or seek to acquire many of the hospitals and clinics that would be suitable candidates for us 
this could limit our ability to grow by acquisitions or make our cost of acquisitions higher and less profitable 
if we fail to compete effectively with other hospitals  clinics and healthcare providers  our net operating revenues and profitability may decline 
the healthcare business is highly competitive  and we compete with other hospitals  rehabilitation clinics and other healthcare providers for patients 
if we are unable to compete effectively in the specialty acute care hospital and outpatient rehabilitation businesses  our net operating revenues and profitability may decline 
many of our specialty hospitals operate in geographic areas where we compete with at least one other hospital that provides similar services 
our outpatient rehabilitation clinics face competition from a variety of local and national outpatient rehabilitation providers 
other outpatient rehabilitation clinics in markets we serve may have greater name recognition and longer operating histories than our clinics 
the managers of these clinics may also have stronger relationships with physicians in their communities  which could give them a competitive advantage for patient referrals 
significant legal actions as well as the cost and possible lack of available insurance could subject us to substantial uninsured liabilities 
in recent years  physicians  hospitals and other healthcare providers have become subject to an increasing number of legal actions alleging malpractice  product liability or related legal theories 
many of these actions involve large claims and significant defense costs 
we are also subject to lawsuits under a federal whistleblower statute designed to combat fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry 
these lawsuits can involve significant monetary damages and award bounties to private plaintiffs who successfully bring the suits 
we maintain professional malpractice liability insurance and general liability insurance coverage 
as a result of unfavorable pricing and availability trends in the professional liability insurance market and the insurance market in general  the cost and risk sharing components of professional liability coverage has changed dramatically 
many insurance underwriters have become more selective in the insurance limits and types of coverage they will provide as a result of the september  terrorist attacks  rising settlement costs and the significant failures of some nationally known insurance underwriters  such as phico insurance company  which provided us medical malpractice coverage from june to december in some instances  insurance underwriters will no longer issue new policies in certain states that have a history of high medical 
table of contents malpractice awards 
as a result  we experienced substantial changes in our medical and professional malpractice insurance program that we renewed on december  among other things  in order to obtain malpractice insurance at a reasonable cost  we were required to assume substantial self insured retentions for our professional liability claims 
a self insured retention is a minimum amount of liability and legal fees that we must pay for each claim 
we have engaged an actuary to assist us in determining the value of the losses that may occur within this self insured retention level and we are required under our insurance agreements to post a letter of credit equal to the estimated losses that we will assume for the policy year 
because of the high retention levels  we cannot predict with absolute certainty the actual amount of the losses we will assume and pay 
we believe that our current insurance program is adequate in amount and coverage 
however  there can be no assurance that in the future such insurance will be available at a reasonable price or that we will not have to further increase our levels of self insurance 
in addition  our insurance coverage does not cover punitive damages and may not cover all claims against us

we may experience difficulties integrating the information systems relating to our outpatient rehabilitation business  which could cause business interruption 
we currently manage our outpatient rehabilitation business using three billing systems 
we will continue our transition to a common system to manage all of our scheduling  billing  collecting and patient information for our outpatient rehabilitation clinics 
if our systems integration fails or works improperly  we could face interruption in the segments of our business undergoing the transition while we correct the problem 
the interruption in the affected segment of our business could include our inability to bill patients and payors for the services we provide 
a sustained inability to bill and collect payments would have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and results of operations 
item properties we currently lease most of our facilities  including clinics  offices  long term acute care hospitals and the corporate headquarters 
we lease all of our clinics and related offices  which  as of december   included outpatient rehabilitation clinics throughout the united states and canada 
the outpatient rehabilitation clinics generally have a five year lease term and include options to renew 
we also lease all of our hospital facilities except for one  square foot facility located in houston  texas 
as of december   we had hospital within a hospital leases and three freestanding building leases 
we generally seek a five year lease for our hospitals  with an additional five year renewal at our option

item legal proceedings on august  a complaint in the us district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania was filed that named as defendants novacare  inc now known as jl halsey corporation  other named defendants and defendants who were to be named at a later time 
this qui tam action sought triple damages and penalties under the false claims act against jl halsey 
table of contents corporation 
the allegations involve  among other things  the distinction between individual and group billing in physical rehabilitation clinics that we acquired from novacare 
on october  the relator plaintiff made a motion to amend the complaint to  among other things  add select medical corporation and some of its subsidiaries acquired in the novacare acquisition as defendants in this case 
this motion was granted in september of the amended complaint alleges that from about january  through the present  the defendants submitted false or fraudulent bills for physical therapy to various federal health programs 
on january   jl halsey corporation and its related subsidiaries including the subsidiaries acquired in the novacare acquisition entered into a settlement agreement with the relator plaintiff and the government  pursuant to which  in exchange for a payment by jl halsey corporation of  the parties settled all claims arising out of conduct that took place before select medical s acquisition of the novacare subsidiaries that are defendants in the case 
claims against the company and the novacare subsidiaries regarding alleged conduct occurring after the novacare acquisition were not covered by the settlement 
in september  select learned that the united states attorney for the eastern district of pennsylvania had notified the court that the united states had decided not to intervene in this case 
as of january   select and the subsidiaries have not been served with the amended complaint 
based on a review of the amended complaint  we do not believe that this lawsuit is meritorious  and we intend to vigorously defend against this action if it is pursued by the relator plaintiff 
however  because of the uncertain nature of the litigation  we cannot predict the outcome of this matter 
in addition  as part of our business  we are subject to legal actions alleging liability on our part 
to cover claims arising out of the operations of our hospitals and outpatient rehabilitation facilities  we generally maintain professional malpractice liability insurance and general liability insurance in amounts and with deductibles that we believe to be sufficient for our operations 
we also maintain umbrella liability coverage covering claims which  due to their nature or amount  are not covered by our insurance policies 
we cannot assure you that professional liability insurance will cover all claims against us or continue to be available at reasonable costs for us to maintain adequate levels of insurance 
these insurance policies also do not cover punitive damages

we are a leading operator of specialty acute care hospitals for long term stay patients in the united states 
we are also a leading operator of outpatient rehabilitation clinics in the united states and canada 
as of december   we operated specialty acute care hospitals in states and outpatient rehabilitation clinics in states  the district of columbia and seven canadian provinces 
we began operations in under the leadership of our current management team 
we operate through two business segments  our specialty acute care hospital segment and our outpatient rehabilitation segment 
for the year ended december   we had net operating revenues of  million 
of this total  we earned of our net operating revenues from our specialty hospitals and from our outpatient rehabilitation businesses 
our specialty acute care hospital segment consists of hospitals designed to serve the needs of long term stay acute patients 
these patients typically suffer from serious and often complex medical conditions that require a high degree of care 
our outpatient rehabilitation business consists of clinics and contract services that provide physical  occupational and speech rehabilitation services 
our patients are typically diagnosed with musculoskeletal impairments that restrict their ability to perform normal activities of daily living 
the following table sets forth operating statistics for our specialty acute care hospitals and our outpatient rehabilitation clinics for each of the periods presented 
the data in the table reflect the changes in the number of specialty acute care hospitals and outpatient rehabilitation clinics we operate that resulted from acquisitions  start up activities and closures 
the operating statistics reflect data for the period of time these operations were managed by us

b net revenue per visit is calculated by dividing outpatient rehabilitation clinic revenue by the total number of visits 
for purposes of this computation  outpatient rehabilitation clinic revenue does not include our canadian subsidiary and contract services revenue 
development of new specialty acute care hospitals and clinics our goal is to open approximately eight to ten new specialty acute care hospitals each year  utilizing primarily our hospital within a hospital model 
we also may open new specialty acute care hospitals in freestanding buildings 
we internally developed ten hospitals in both and and eight hospitals in of the eight hospitals we opened in  six utilized our hospital within a hospital model and two were freestanding facilities 
each internally developed hospital has typically required approximately million over the initial year of operations to fund leasehold improvements  equipment  start up losses and working capital 
we also intend to open new clinics in our current markets where we can benefit from existing referral relationships and brand awareness to produce incremental growth 
from time to time  we also intend to evaluate acquisition opportunities that may enhance the scale of our business and expand our geographic reach 
critical accounting matters sources of revenue our net operating revenues are derived from a number of sources  including commercial  managed care  private and governmental payors 
our net operating revenues include amounts estimated by management to be reimbursable from each of the applicable payors and the federal medicare program 
amounts we receive for treatment of patients are generally less than the standard billing rates 
we account for the differences between the estimated reimbursement rates and the standard billing rates as contractual adjustments  which we deduct from gross revenues to arrive at net operating revenues 
a substantial portion of our specialty hospital revenue was received during the three years ended december  from services provided to medicare patients and paid by medicare under a cost based reimbursement methodology 
these payments are subject to final cost report settlements based on administrative review and audit by third parties 
an annual cost report is filed for each provider to report 
table of contents the cost of providing services and to settle the difference between the interim payments we receive and final costs 
we record adjustments to the original estimates in the periods that such adjustments become known 
historically these adjustments have not been significant 
because our routine payments from medicare are different than the final reimbursement due to us under the cost based reimbursement system  we record a receivable or payable for the difference 
as of december   we had a net amount due to medicare of million 
at december   we had a net amount due to medicare of million 
we recorded this amount as due to third party payors on our balance sheet 
substantially all of our medicare cost reports are settled through net operating revenues generated directly from the medicare program represented approximately  and of net operating revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the gradual increase in the percentage of our revenues generated from the medicare program is due to the growth in the number of specialty hospitals and their higher respective share of medicare revenues generated in this segment of our business compared to our outpatient rehabilitation segment 
on august   the centers for medicare medicaid services cms published final regulations establishing a prospective payment system for medicare payment of long term acute care hospitals ltch pps  which replaces the reasonable cost based payment system previously in effect 
under ltch pps  each discharged patient will be assigned to a distinct long term care diagnosis related group ltc drg  and a long term acute care hospital will generally be paid a pre determined fixed amount applicable to the assigned ltc drg adjusted for area wage differences 
as required by congress  ltc drg payment rates have been set to maintain budget neutrality with total expenditures that would have been made under the reasonable cost based payment system 
ltch pps is being phased in over a five year transition period  during which a long term care hospital s payment for each medicare patient will be a blended amount consisting of set percentages of the ltc drg payment rate and the hospital s reasonable cost based reimbursement 
the ltc drg payment rate is for a hospital s cost reporting period beginning on or after october   and will increase by for each cost reporting period thereafter until the hospital s cost reporting period beginning on or after october   when the hospital will be paid solely on the basis of ltc drg payment rates 
a long term acute care hospital may elect to be paid solely on the basis of ltc drg payment rates and not be subject to the transition period at the start of any of its cost reporting periods during the transition period 
through december   of our hospitals have implemented ltch pps pursuant to the new regulations 
twelve of these hospitals elected to be paid solely on the basis of the ltc drg payment rates 
the ltch pps regulations also refined the criteria that must be met in order for a hospital to be classified as a long term acute care hospital 
for cost reporting periods beginning on or after october   a long term acute care hospital must have an average inpatient length of stay for medicare patients including both medicare covered and non covered days of greater than days 
previously  average lengths of stay were measured with respect to all patients 
under the ltch pps  it may be possible for our hospitals to experience enhanced financial performance 
however  there are risks associated with transitioning to the new payment system 
we believe that the conversion to the new payment system will be accretive to our earnings  but we are still assessing the potential impact of the ltch pps 
other revenue primarily represents amounts the medicare program reimburses us for a portion of our corporate expenses that are related to our specialty hospital operations 
under the ltch pps  we will no longer be specifically reimbursed for the portion of our corporate costs related to the provision of medicare services in our specialty hospitals 
instead  we will receive from medicare a pre determined fixed amount assigned to the applicable ltc drg  which is intended to reflect the average cost of treating such a patient  including corporate costs 
as a result of this change in our revenue stream  we 
table of contents will begin allocating corporate departmental costs that are directly related to our specialty hospital operations to our specialty hospital segment in to better match the cost with the revenues for this segment 
we do not believe that this allocation of costs will have any adverse impact on the profitability or margins of this segment  due to the increase in net revenue this segment will experience under ltch pps 
insurance under a number of our insurance programs  which includes our employee health insurance program and certain components under our property and casualty insurance program  we are liable for a portion of our losses 
in these cases we accrue for our losses under an occurrence based principal whereby we estimate the losses that will be incurred by us in a respective accounting period and accrue that estimated liability 
where we have substantial exposure  we utilize actuaries to assist us in estimating the losses 
in cases where we have minimal exposure  we will estimate our losses by analyzing historical trends 
we monitor these programs quarterly and make revision to our estimates as necessary to appropriately reflect our liability under these programs 
bad debts we estimate our bad debts based upon the age of our accounts receivable and our historical collection percentages 
these estimates are sensitive to changes in the economy that affect our customers 
related party we are party to various rental and other agreements with companies affiliated with us through common ownership 
our payments to these related parties amounted to million  million and million in  and  respectively 
our future commitments are related to commercial office space that we lease for our corporate headquarters in mechanicsburg  pennsylvania 
these future commitments amount to million through these transactions and commitments are described more fully in note to select medical corporation s consolidated financial statements

we recorded income tax expense of million for the year ended december  this expense represented an effective tax rate of 
this exceeded the statutory rates primarily due to non deductible goodwill 
in  we were able to utilize net operating loss carryovers to offset the effect of our non deductible goodwill 
as a result of our limited operating history and the cumulative losses incurred in prior years  we historically provided a valuation allowance for substantially all of our deferred tax assets 
because of the cumulative profitable operations in the three years prior to december   we concluded that it was more likely than not that these deferred tax items would be realized 
the reversal of these valuation allowances in the fourth quarter of resulted in a reduction in the tax provision of million and a reduction in goodwill of million 
the reduction in goodwill relates to those deferred tax assets originating through acquisitions 
the reduction in the tax provision generated a positive earnings per share effect of for the year 
extraordinary item as a result of our initial public offering of stock in april and the issuance of million of senior subordinated notes in june  we repaid million of our us term loan and all million of our senior subordinated notes 
the extraordinary item consists of million of unamortized deferred financing costs related to the repayment of our us term loan and million of 
table of contents deferred financing costs and unamortized discount related to the repayment of our senior subordinated notes 
these costs were offset by a tax benefit of million 
capital resources and liquidity years ended december    and operating activities generated million  million and million in cash during the years ended december   and  respectively 
the trend of increases in cash flow experienced over this time frame is attributable to improved operating income  continued management of payables and lower accounts receivable days outstanding 
our accounts receivable days outstanding were days at december  compared to days at december  and days at december  investing activities used million and million of cash flow for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this usage resulted from purchases of property and equipment of million and million in and  respectively  and was related principally to new hospital development 
additionally  we incurred earnout and acquisition related payments of million and million  respectively in and million and million  respectively in the earnout payments related principally to obligations we assumed as part of the novacare acquisition 
acquisition payments related to amounts we paid for new business acquisitions  although in  a portion of the acquisition payments related to our purchases of minority interests 
the terms of our agreements with these minority owners allowed some of them to sell their minority interests to us upon the completion of our initial public offering 
in total  we paid these minority owners million for their ownership interests 
of this amount  million was paid in cash and million was paid in our stock 
investing activities provided million of cash flow during for the year ended december   we received proceeds of million from two escrow funds established as part of the novacare acquisition and proceeds of million from the sale of the occupational health centers 
these occupational health centers were an operating division of novacare 
the claim against the escrow fund resulted from an increase in uncollectible accounts receivable  which were paid with the proceeds from the escrow fund 
cash inflows were offset principally by the purchase of million of equipment and acquisition and earnout payments of million 
the increase in property and equipment purchases reflects the growth in new hospital development during financing activities used million and million of cash for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this was due principally to the repayment of our credit facility and seller debt 
in  we had two significant financing transactions that refinanced existing capital 
on april  we completed an initial public offering of million shares of our common stock 
our net proceeds after deducting expenses and underwriting discounts and commissions were approximately million 
on april  the underwriters exercised their option to purchase an additional million shares of common stock to cover overallotments 
the net proceeds from the exercise of this option were million after deduction of the underwriters discount 
the proceeds of the stock offerings were used to repay million of our senior debt under the term loan portion of our bank credit facility  to redeem million of our class a preferred stock and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes including the purchases of minority interests 
on june   we issued and sold million of senior subordinated notes due the net proceeds from the sale were approximately million  after deducting discounts  commissions and expenses of the offering 
we used million of the net proceeds to retire our senior subordinated notes which were issued in december  february and november we used an additional million of the net proceeds to repay part of our senior indebtedness under both the term loan and 
table of contents revolving portions of our senior credit facility 
the remainder of the net proceeds was used to pay accrued interest 
financing activities used million of cash for the year ended december  this was due principally to the repayment of debt 
capital resources net working capital remained relatively consistent at million at december  compared to million at december  on september  we entered into a new credit agreement that refinanced our existing bank debt 
in january  in anticipation of our initial public offering  we entered into an amendment to our credit agreement that became effective in april the amendment allowed for the use of the net proceeds of the offering to repay million of our senior debt under the us term loan portion of our bank credit facility and to redeem million of our class a preferred stock 
in may  in anticipation of the senior subordinated note offering  we entered into another amendment to our credit agreement that became effective in june the amendment allowed for the use of net proceeds to repay million of our senior debt under the us term loan portion and million of our senior debt under the us revolving portion of our bank credit facility and to repay million of existing subordinated debt 
the amendment to the credit facility also increased our revolving credit facility by million 
our credit facility now consists of a term facility of approximately million  and a revolving credit facility of approximately million 
the term debt began quarterly amortization in september   with a final maturity date of september as of december  we had the ability to borrow an additional million under our revolving facility 
the revolving facility terminates in september borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at a fluctuating rate of interest based upon financial covenant ratio tests 
as of december   our weighted average interest rate under our credit agreement was approximately 
a portion of the amount borrowed under our us term loan portion of our credit agreement is hedged through an interest rate swap transaction  which fixes the rate paid through the term of the agreement 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures on market risk for a discussion of our floating interest rates on borrowings under our credit facility 
we are required to pay a quarterly commitment fee at a rate that ranges from 
to  based upon financial covenant ratio tests 
this fee applies to unused commitments under the revolving credit facility 
the terms of the credit agreement include various restrictive covenants 
these covenants include restrictions against incurring additional indebtedness  disposing of assets  incurring capital expenditures  making investments  restrictions against paying certain dividends  engaging in transactions with affiliates  incurring contingent obligations  and 
table of contents allowing or causing fundamental changes 
the covenants also require us to maintain various financial ratios regarding total indebtedness  interest  fixed charges and net worth 
the borrowings are collateralized by substantially all of the tangible and intangible assets of us and our subsidiaries  including all of the capital stock of our domestic subsidiaries and of the capital stock of our direct foreign subsidiaries 
in addition  the loans have been guaranteed by our domestic subsidiaries 
on june   we issued and sold million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes due june  the notes were issued under an indenture dated as of june  between us and state street bank and trust company  na  as trustee 
interest on the notes is payable semiannually in arrears on june and december of each year  commencing december  the notes are unsecured senior subordinated obligations of select medical  are subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future senior indebtedness of select medical  and are senior in right of payment to all future subordinated indebtedness of select medical 
the notes are guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by all of our wholly owned domestic subsidiaries  subject to certain exceptions 
on or after june   the notes may be redeemed at our option  in whole or in part  at redemption prices that decline annually to on and after june   plus accrued and unpaid interest 
upon a change of control of select medical  each holder of notes may require us to repurchase all or any portion of the holder s notes at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase 
the indenture contains certain covenants that  among other things  limit the incurrence of additional debt by select medical and certain of its subsidiaries  the payment of dividends on capital stock of select medical and the purchase  redemption or retirement of capital stock or subordinated indebtedness  investments  certain transactions with affiliates  sales of assets  including capital stock of subsidiaries  and certain consolidations  mergers and transfers of assets 
the indenture also prohibits certain restrictions on distributions from certain subsidiaries 
all of these limitations and prohibitions  however  are subject to a number of qualifications 
we believe existing cash balances  internally generated cash flows and borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to finance operations for at least the next twelve months 
however  we expect that our cash flow from operations for will be lower relative to our profits as compared to because of the following three items 
first  the conditions that have allowed us to minimize our cash income tax payments in will no longer provide us those benefits 
these amounts are currently shown as income taxes payable 
second  as a normal course of business  we will be repaying amounts currently overfunded to us by the medicare and medicaid programs 
these amounts are listed as due to third party payor on our balance sheet 
finally  in the short term we may experience underpayments from the medicare program for our long term acute care hospitals as they transition to ltch pps 
in the year ended december   we opened eight specialty hospitals 
a new specialty hospital has typically required approximately million per hospital over the initial year of operations to fund leasehold improvements  equipment  start up losses and working capital 
from time to time  we may complete acquisitions of specialty hospitals and outpatient rehabilitation businesses 
as of december   we had approximately million of unused capacity under our revolving credit facility which can be used for acquisitions 
based on the size of the acquisition  approval of the acquisition by our lenders may be required 
if funds required for future acquisitions exceed existing sources of capital  we will need to increase our credit facilities or obtain additional capital by other means 
commitments and contingencies in february  phico insurance company phico  at the request of the pennsylvania insurance department  was placed in liquidation by an order of the commonwealth court of 
table of contents pennsylvania liquidation order 
from june through december  we had placed our primary malpractice insurance coverage through phico 
in january  these policies were replaced with policies issued by other insurers 
currently we have approximately unsettled claims in seven states from the policy years covered by phico issued policies 
the liquidation order refers these claims to the various state guaranty associations 
these state guaranty association statutes generally provide for coverage between  per insured claim  depending upon the state 
some states also have catastrophic loss funds to cover settlements in excess of the available state guaranty funds 
most state insurance guaranty statutes provide for net worth and residency limitations that  if applicable  may limit or prevent us from recovering from these state guaranty association funds 
at this time  we believe that we will meet the requirements for coverage under the applicable state guaranty association statutes  and that the resolution of these claims will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  cash flow or results of operations 
however  because the rules related to state guaranty association funds are subject to interpretation  and because these claims are still in the process of resolution  our conclusions may change as this process progresses 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
payments due by year contractual obligations in thousands total after subordinated notes credit facility seller notes capital lease obligations other debt obligations total debt letters of credit outstanding shareholder life insurance policy a purchase obligations naming  promotional and sponsorship agreement operating leases related party operating leases total contractual cash obligations a beginning in october  we suspended the premium payments that we are obligated to make after the enactment of the sarbanes oxley act of  pending clarification regarding the legality of making the payments 
medical and professional malpractice insurance in recent years  physicians  hospitals and other healthcare providers have become subject to an increasing number of legal actions alleging malpractice  product liability or related legal theories 
many of these actions involve large claims and significant defense costs 
we maintain professional malpractice liability insurance and general liability insurance coverage 
as a result of unfavorable pricing and availability trends in the professional liability insurance market and the insurance market in general  the cost and risk sharing components of professional liability coverage has changed dramatically 
many insurance underwriters have become more selective in the insurance limits and types of coverage 
table of contents they will provide as a result of the september  terrorist attacks  rising settlement costs and the significant failures of some nationally known insurance underwriters  such as phico insurance company  which provided us medical malpractice coverage from june to december in some instances  insurance underwriters will no longer issue new policies in certain states that have a history of high medical malpractice awards 
as a result  we experienced substantial changes in our medical and professional malpractice insurance program that we renewed on december  among other things  in order to obtain malpractice insurance at a reasonable cost  we were required to assume substantial self insured retentions for our professional liability claims 
a self insured retention is a minimum amount of liability and legal fees that we must pay for each claim 
we have engaged an actuary to assist us in determining the value of the losses that may occur within this self insured retention level and we are required under our insurance agreements to post a letter of credit equal to the estimated losses that we will assume for the policy year 
because of the high retention levels  we cannot predict with absolute certainty the actual amount of the losses we will assume and pay 
to the extent that subsequent claims information varies from loss estimates  the liabilities will be adjusted to reflect current loss data 
we believe that our current insurance program is adequate in amount and coverage 
however  there can be no assurance that in the future such insurance will be available at a reasonable price or that we will not have to further increase our levels of self insurance 
physicians who refer patients to our facilities are facing similar difficulties obtaining malpractice insurance at a reasonable cost  which could adversely impact the number of our referrals 
inflation the healthcare industry is labor intensive 
wages and other expenses increase during periods of inflation and when labor shortages occur in the marketplace 
in addition  suppliers pass along rising costs to us in the form of higher prices 
we have implemented cost control measures  including our case and resource management program  to curtail increases in operating costs and expenses 
we have  to date  offset increases in operating costs by increasing reimbursement for services and expanding services 
however  we cannot predict our ability to cover or offset future cost increases

the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of fin are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements in fin are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  we do not expect fin to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
requires recording costs associated with exit or disposal activities at their fair values when a liability has been incurred

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate changes  primarily as a result of floating interest rates on borrowings under our credit facility 
a change in interest rates by one percentage point on variable rate debt would have resulted in interest expense fluctuating approximately million for the year ended december  as required by our credit agreement  on march  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that fixes the interest rate cost to us on a portion of the us term loans outstanding under our credit facility for a period of four years 
the swap became effective on april  in we amended the swap to mature in march approximately million of variable credit facility debt has been converted to fixed rate debt 
the fixed rate portion of all of our outstanding us term loans was as of december  approximately of our term loan borrowings under our credit agreement are denominated in canadian dollars 
although we are not required by our credit agreement to maintain a hedge on our foreign currency risk  we have entered into a five year agreement that allows us to limit the cost of canadian dollars to a range of us to us per canadian dollar to limit our risk on the potential fluctuation in the exchange rate of the canadian dollar to the us dollar
