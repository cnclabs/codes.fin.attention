full year results included million in unusual pre tax charges related to million of reductions in the estimated market values of aircraft  million retroactive wages and benefits as a result of labor contract settlements  million of employee severance costs following the events of september  and million in other non operating charges 
these charges were offset by million of grant income from the us government under the airline stabilization act and a million gain from the sale of the company s investment in continental airlines  inc substantially all of the company s results of operations are attributable to its principal indirect operating subsidiary  northwest  which accounted for approximately of the company s consolidated operating revenues and expenses 
the company s results of operations also include other subsidiaries  of which mlt inc mlt and pinnacle airlines  inc pinnacle airlines are the most significant 
the following discussion pertains primarily to northwest and  where indicated  mlt and pinnacle airlines 
northwest and airline industry current status the current us airline industry environment is the worst in history 
since early  the us airline industry has suffered a significant decline in revenues versus what would have been expected based on historical growth trends 
this shortfall has been caused by a number of factors 
the rapid growth of low cost airlines has had a profound impact on industry revenues 
using the advantage of low unit costs  these carriers offer lower fares  particularly those targeted at business passengers  in order to shift demand from larger  more established airlines 
as a result of growth  these low cost carriers now transport nearly of all domestic us passengers compared to less than a decade ago 
they now compete for  and thus influence industry pricing on  approximately of all domestic us passenger ticket sales compared to less than a decade ago 
as a result of their better financial performance  low cost carriers are expected to continue to grow their market share 
while the advent of internet travel web sites has driven significant distribution cost savings for airlines  it has had a large negative impact on airline revenues 
having access to perfect pricing information  air travel consumers have become more efficient at finding lower fare alternatives than in the past 
the increased price consciousness of travelers  as well as the proliferation of distribution channels  has further motivated airlines to price more aggressively to gain fare advantages through certain channels 
the us airline industry is one of the most heavily taxed of all industries 
taxes and fees now represent approximately of what a passenger pays for an average domestic airline ticket  a percentage even greater than that for alcohol and tobacco products 
these taxes and fees have grown significantly in the past decade  most recently with the introduction of a security fee imposed on each passenger flight segment  subject to a per roundtrip cap 
the company believes that every dollar of tax or fee increase imposed on airline passengers roughly translates into a dollar of reduced airline revenue  particularly over the long run 
the attacks of september  materially impacted and continue to impact air travel 
concerns about further terrorist attacks  which are unlikely to abate any time soon  have had a negative impact on air travel demand 
furthermore  security procedures introduced at airports since the attacks have increased  both in reality and in perception  the inconvenience of flying and thus further reduced demand 
while the factors noted are believed to be lasting  if not permanent  and could in fact worsen over time  some of the current airline industry revenue shortfall is believed to be cyclical in nature 
us airline revenues have historically been and continue to be influenced by the strength of the us economy 
furthermore  airline business revenues are greatly influenced by the growth in corporate profitability 
the current sluggishness of both the economy and corporate profitability is adversely affecting airline revenues 
the airline industry revenue decline has been further exacerbated in early in january  united airlines introduced a new pricing structure  reducing its highest business fares by 
this action and the resulting match by other airlines has reduced average fares without a corresponding increase in demand 
the threat of a war with iraq has also materially affected future airline bookings  particularly for international travel 
in addition to the impact on industry revenue  the september  events caused a significant rise in certain operating costs  particularly for aviation and property insurance 
total aviation and property insurance expense nearly tripled in  to million 
these costs could rise further should coverage presently provided by the government under the homeland security act  which has been extended until august   no longer be available 
during the past year  two major us airlines  us airways  inc and united air lines  inc  have filed for chapter bankruptcy protection 
current trends make it likely that the airline industry will continue to post significant losses  at least through in response to the industry environment  the company has taken several steps to mitigate the impact on its results of operations and financial condition 
these steps included a significant reduction in scheduled capacity on an available seat mile basis  a reduction in work force of  employees  deferral of certain aircraft orders previously scheduled for delivery in through for an average of two years  closure of maintenance facilities  flight crew bases  reservations and sales facilities and deferrals and cancellations of discretionary and other non operationally critical spending 
for the year ended december   capacity was below levels 
while the company has already taken these significant cost reduction steps  it believes additional measures will be necessary in this new and permanently changed revenue environment 
wages  salaries and benefits made up of the company s operating revenues and will need to be a major component of future cost reduction initiatives 
the company has begun discussions with its labor unions in an effort to align wages  benefits and work rules with the new revenue environment and to remain competitive with those airlines achieving permanent cost reductions through bankruptcy proceedings 
results of operations compared to operating revenues 
operating revenues decreased million

capacity was reduced as a result of the september  terrorist attacks and weakened us and international economies 
cargo revenues increased million to million due to a increase in cargo ton miles partially offset by a decline in revenue per ton mile 
cargo revenues consist of freight and mail carried on passenger aircraft and the company s f dedicated freighters 
freight revenue increased million  including a benefit of approximately million in the fourth quarter resulting from the west coast dockworkers lockout 
however  the freight revenue increase was partially offset by a million decrease in mail revenue due largely to lower volume from us government restrictions on transportation of packages larger than ounces on passenger aircraft 
other revenues  the principal components of which are mlt a wholly owned subsidiary  other transportation fees and charter revenues  decreased million 
this decline was primarily due to reduced revenues from mlt  klm royal dutch airlines klm joint venture settlements  ticketing and handling fees and support services  partially offset by an increase in frequent flyer program partnership revenue

other income and expense 
other non operating income decreased by million  primarily due to million recognized in under the airline stabilization act  higher interest expense related to increased debt levels  and lower interest income as a result of lower interest rates 
in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a million charge to write down a portion of a receivable from the us government to reflect the final amount received in january under the airline stabilization act 
interest expense increased million primarily due to the full year borrowings under the company s revolving credit facilities and additional new financings 
higher earnings from affiliates during were partially offset by a million gain from the sale of the company s remaining shares of continental recorded in tax expense benefit 
the tax benefit recorded in includes a provision of million for tax credits that are expected to expire unused 
the company s net deferred tax liability declined from million at december  to million at december   primarily due to the increase in deferred tax assets relating to the company s pension plans and the company s losses 
given its recent loss experience  current accounting rules do not allow its balance sheet to reflect a net tax asset position 
as a result  when future losses generate deferred tax assets that fully offset the company s deferred tax liabilities  no further tax benefit may be recognized with respect to those losses 
the company expects that approximately million of losses in will yield tax benefits capable of being recognized 
consequently  pre tax losses above million are not expected to be reduced by the recognition of future tax benefits associated with such losses

the company s pension contributions associated with the plan year are estimated to be million 
the company also had  as of december   million of mandatory contributions related to the plan year remaining to be paid in pension funding requirements are dependent upon various factors  including interest rate levels  asset returns  regulatory requirements for funding purposes and changes to pension plan benefits 
absent favorable changes to these factors  the company will have to satisfy the underfunded amounts of its plans through cash contributions over time 
on november   the company submitted an application to the internal revenue service for authorization to reschedule plan year contributions required under the pension plans for contract and salaried employees 
this application  if approved  could allow the company to defer some or all of the million in plan year contributions due in calendar the company anticipates receiving notice from the internal revenue service by april the company has also submitted an application to the department of labor to permit the company to contribute common stock of pinnacle airlines corp 
to the pension plans in lieu of making certain required contributions in cash 
in january  the department of labor issued a proposed prohibited transaction exemption that would allow the company to contribute common stock of pinnacle airlines corp 
to satisfy a portion of the contribution requirements to northwest s pension plans in and the proposed prohibited transaction exemption contemplates that the pension plans will have the right at any time to sell the shares back to the company for cash at the greater of the original purchase price or the then market value 
pinnacle airlines corp 
was incorporated in delaware on january  for the sole purpose of becoming a holding company of pinnacle airlines

the lowering of the company s credit ratings could make it more difficult to issue debt  to renew outstanding letters of credit that back certain obligations and to obtain financial instruments used in its fuel and currency hedging programs  as well as to potentially increase the cost of these transactions 
for information regarding the impact from the lowering of the company s secured credit facility credit rating on june   see the related discussion below as well as note to the consolidated financial statements

secured credit facilities 
the company s secured credit facilities at december   consisted of a million revolving credit facility million of which has been utilized to establish letters of credit available until october  and a million day revolving credit facility available until october renewable annually at the option of the lenders  however  to the extent any portion of the million facility is not renewed for an additional day period  the company may borrow up to the entire non renewed portion of the facility and such borrowings would then mature in october this credit agreement is secured by the company s pacific route system and certain aircraft 
on june   standard poor s downgraded the rating on the company s secured credit facilities to bb from bb 
with the change in credit rating  the interest rate applicable to borrowings under these secured credit facilities increased 
borrowings under the million revolving credit facility bore interest at a variable rate equal to the three month libor plus at february  and borrowings under the million day revolving credit facility bore interest at a variable rate equal to the three month libor plus at february  
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these credit facilities 
other financings 
in january  through nwa funding llc  the company fully repaid million outstanding under a receivables purchase agreement 
such repayment was required upon the occurrence of certain events  including exceeding a threshold of passenger refunds as a percentage of sales and the lowering of the company s unsecured credit rating  both of which occurred following the events of september  during june  a second receivables purchase agreement was executed by northwest  nwa funding ii  llc nwa funding ii  a wholly owned  non consolidated subsidiary of the company  and a certain third party purchaser the purchaser pursuant to a securitization transaction 
during june  northwest sold million of accounts receivable on a non recourse basis to nwa funding ii  which sold million of its undivided interest in such receivables to the purchaser  subject to specified collateral requirements 
the amount of loss recognized related to receivables securitized was not material 
nwa funding ii maintains a variable undivided interest in these receivables and is subject to losses on its share of the receivables and  accordingly  maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts 
the agreement is a one year  million revolving receivable purchase facility renewable annually that allows northwest to sell additional receivables to nwa funding ii and nwa funding ii to sell variable undivided interests in these receivables to the purchaser 
nwa funding ii pays a yield to the purchaser equal to a f commercial paper  as well as a program fee 
the agreement provides for the early termination upon the occurrence of certain events including  among others  a strike event  falling below a minimum liquidity requirement of billion as of the last day of any fiscal quarter  or the company not meeting minimum credit ratings defined as any two of the following three events occurring i s p s long term local issuer credit rating below a b credit rating  ii moody s senior implied rating below a b credit rating  or iii fitch s senior unsecured debt rating below a b credit rating

critical accounting estimates the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting estimates are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the application of these estimates and other accounting policies 
the company s management discussed the development of the estimates and disclosures related to each of these matters with the audit committee of the company s board of directors 
aircraft valuation and impairments 
the company has evaluated its long lived assets for possible impairments in compliance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the company records impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts 
impairment losses are measured by comparing the fair value of the assets to their carrying amounts 
in determining the need to record impairment charges  the company is required to make certain estimates regarding such things as the current fair market value of the asset and future net cash flows to be generated by the asset 
the current fair market value of the asset is determined by independent appraisal  and the future net cash flows are based on assumptions such as asset utilization  expected remaining useful lives  future market trends and projected salvage values 
impairment charges are recorded in depreciation and amortization expense on the company s consolidated statements of operations 
if there are subsequent changes in these estimates  or if actual results differ from these estimates  such changes could impact the consolidated financial statements 
in december  the company revised its fleet plan  accelerating the retirement of dc and nine boeing aircraft by an average of five and six years respectively 
the company recorded impairment charges of million associated with these aircraft  engines and related inventory as a result of the retirement acceleration 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of impairment of long lived assets 
the company s operating results will also be impacted by an estimated million of additional depreciation expense  reflecting the combined result of the reduced average lives  a decrease in net book values and lower salvage values 
if the current fair market values and salvage values of the impaired aircraft were decreased by  the aircraft impairment charge would have increased by million and the depreciation expense would decrease by million 
pension liability and expense 
the company has several noncontributory pension plans covering substantially all of its employees 
the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
benefits associated with these plans are based primarily on years of service and  in some cases  employee compensation 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining pension liability and expense 
a significant element in determining the company s pension expense in accordance with sfas no 
is the expected return on plan assets  which is based on historical results for similar allocations among asset classes 
the difference between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred and  under certain circumstances  amortized over future years of service 
therefore  the net deferral of past asset gains losses ultimately affects future pension expense 
at december   the company changed its assumed expected long term rate of return on plan assets from to 
in developing the expected long term rate of return assumption  the company is provided projected returns by asset class from its pension investment advisors 
projected returns are based primarily on broad  publicly traded equity and fixed income indices 
the company s expected long term rate of return on plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of us and international equities  with an expected long term rate of return of  private equities with an expected long term rate of return of  and fixed income securities with an expected long term rate of return of 
these assumptions result in a weighted average rate of return on an annualized basis 
because of temporary fluctuations in market values  the actual asset allocation as of december  was equities and fixed income instruments 
the actual asset allocation is reviewed regularly and is periodically rebalanced to the targeted allocation 
the plan assets have earned a rate of return substantially less than in each of the last three years 
should this trend continue  the company s average long term historical rate of return in subsequent periods may be lower and could  in turn  cause the expected return on plan assets to be adjusted downward 
if such adjustments become necessary  future pension expense would increase 
plan assets for the company s pension plans are managed by external investment management organizations 
these advisors are prohibited by the investment policies of the plan from investing in company securities  other than as part of a market index fund that could have a diminutive proportion of such securities 
at the end of each year  the company determines the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities 
the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
in estimating this rate  the company looks to rates of return on fixed income investments of similar duration to the liabilities in the plan that receive high  investment grade ratings by recognized ratings agencies 
by applying this methodology  the company determined a discount rate of to be appropriate at december   which is a reduction of from the rate used at december  for the year ended december   the net effect of accounting for changes in the company s pension plans decreased accumulated other comprehensive income by billion 
the negative impact on accumulated other comprehensive income was principally due to a decrease in the fair value of the plan assets and the decrease in the discount rate to 
holding all other factors constant  a change in the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities by would have changed accumulated other comprehensive income by million 
for the year ended december   the company recognized consolidated pretax pension expense of million  up from million in pension expense is anticipated to increase to approximately million in holding all other factors constant  an increase decrease in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets by would decrease increase pension expense by approximately million in holding all other factors constant  an increase decrease in the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities by would decrease increase pension expense by approximately million in revenue recognition 
passenger ticket proceeds are recorded in the air traffic liability account at the time of sale and represent an obligation of the company to provide air travel in the future 
revenue is recognized  and the air traffic liability is reduced  as passengers use these tickets for transportation 
the company also performs monthly evaluations of this estimated liability and recognizes any adjustments as passenger revenues for that period 
these adjustments relate primarily to ticket usage patterns  refunds  exchanges  inter airline transactions  and other items for which final settlement occurs in periods subsequent to the sale of the related tickets at amounts other than the original sales price 
while these factors generally follow predictable patterns that provide a reliable basis for estimating the air traffic liability  and the company uses historical trends and averages in its estimates  significant changes in business conditions and or passenger behavior that affect these estimates could have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements 
during  adjustments to the air traffic liability  reflecting unused tickets and the other factors cited above  were above historical norms by an amount that approximated one percent of passenger revenues 
frequent flyer accounting 
the company utilizes a number of estimates in accounting for its worldperks frequent flyer program 
the company accounts for the frequent flyer program obligations by recording a liability for the estimated incremental cost of flight awards expected to be redeemed 
a customer is expected to redeem their mileage  and a liability is recorded  when their account accumulates the minimum number of miles needed to obtain one flight award 
additional assumptions are made  based on past general customer behavior  regarding the likelihood of customers using the miles for first class upgrades or other premiums instead of flight awards  as well as the likelihood of a customer never redeeming the miles 
the estimated incremental cost is based on the system average cost per passenger for food and beverage  fuel  insurance  security  miscellaneous claims and worldperks service center expense 
if the average incremental cost of outstanding awards were increased or decreased by  the liability for the estimated incremental cost of flight awards expected to be redeemed would change by million 
the number of estimated travel awards outstanding at december   and was approximately   and  respectively 
the estimated liability excludes accounts that have never attained the minimum travel award level and awards that are expected to be redeemed for upgrades or are not expected to be redeemed at all  but includes an estimate for partially earned awards on accounts that previously earned an award 
northwest has recorded a liability for these estimated awards of million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
the number of travel awards used for travel on northwest during the years ended december   and was approximately   and  respectively 
these awards represented an estimated  and of northwest s total rpms for each such year  respectively 
northwest believes displacement of revenue passengers is minimal based on the low ratio of worldperks award usage to revenue passenger miles and the company s ability to manage frequent flyer inventory through seat allocations 
in june  the minimum program award miles was changed from  to  miles 
the company defers a portion of the revenue from the sale of mileage credits to participating partners such as credit card issuers  hotels  long distance companies  car rental firms and other non airline partners 
the deferred revenue is recognized over the period in which the credits are expected to be redeemed for travel 
the portion of revenue that is recognized at the time of sale represents amounts in excess of the fair value of the tickets to be redeemed 
goodwill and intangible assets 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that companies test goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis rather than amortize such assets 
the company adopted sfas no 
on january   and as a result no longer amortizes its indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill 
during the first quarter of  the company performed the impairment test of its international routes and found the fair value to be in excess of the carrying value 
during the first quarter of  an independent third party appraisal was conducted for the company s annual impairment test of its international routes and found the fair value to be in excess of the carrying value 
during the fourth quarter of  the company also completed its impairment test of goodwill and found the fair value to be in excess of the carrying value 
the company s indefinite lived intangible asset derives from the us japan bilateral aviation agreement  which establishes rights to carry traffic between japan and the us  and extensive fifth freedom rights between japan and india  the south pacific and other asian destinations 
fifth freedom rights allow northwest to operate service from any gateway in japan to points beyond japan and carry japanese originating passengers 
these rights have no termination date  and the company has the supporting infrastructure airport gates  slots and terminal facility leases in place to operate air service to japan and beyond from its us hub airports indefinitely 
governmental policy and bilateral agreements between nations regulate international operating route authorities and alliances 
the company s carrying value of international route authorities was million at december  should any changes occur in policies  agreements  infrastructure or economic feasibility of air service to japan  the company will assess this asset for impairment and re evaluate the economic life of these international routes 
if the life is then determined to be finite  the company would begin amortizing the asset 
the company s goodwill balance of million relates solely to the purchase of pinnacle airlines

the new options have a strike price of  the average of the high and low price of the company s common stock on the award date of january  the compensation expense related to these new options will be amortized over a four year vesting period using the fair value method of recording stock based employee compensation 
certain other management employees of the company were able to exchange their current stock options for phantom units at a ratio of three old options for one phantom unit 
the compensation expense related to these phantom units will be recognized over the four year vesting period  adjusted for the current period stock price  consistent with how phantom units have been expensed in the past

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the risks inherent in the company s market sensitive instruments and positions are the potential losses arising from adverse changes in the price of fuel  foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates  as discussed below 
the sensitivity analyses presented do not consider the effects that such adverse changes may have on overall economic activity nor do they consider additional actions management may take to mitigate its exposure to such changes 
actual results may differ from the outcomes estimated in the analysis due to factors beyond the company s control 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for accounting policies and additional information 
aircraft fuel 
the company s earnings are affected by changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel 
in order to provide a measure of control over near term price and supply  the company trades and ships fuel and maintains fuel storage facilities to support its flight operations 
the company also manages the price risk of fuel costs primarily utilizing futures contracts traded on regulated futures exchanges  swap agreements and options 
market risk is estimated using a hypothetical increase in the december  cost per gallon of fuel  assuming projected fuel usage 
net of hedging  such change would result in an increase to aircraft fuel expense of approximately million in  compared to an estimated million for measured at december  as of december   the company had hedged approximately and of first quarter and full year fuel requirements  respectively  compared to and of the first quarter and full year requirements  respectively  at december  foreign currency 
the company is exposed to the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the us dollar value of foreign currency denominated operating revenues and expenses 
the company s largest exposure comes from the japanese yen 
from time to time  the company uses financial instruments to hedge its exposure to the japanese yen 
the result of a uniform strengthening in the value of the us dollar from december  levels relative to each of the currencies in which the company s revenues and expenses are denominated would result in a decrease in operating income of approximately million for the year ending december   compared to an estimated decrease of million for measured at december  this sensitivity analysis was prepared based upon projected foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses as of december  and the variance is due to the company s foreign currency denominated revenues exceeding its foreign currency denominated expenses 
the company also has foreign currency non cash exposure 
the result of a weakening in the value of the us dollar would result in an increase to other income caused by the remeasurement of net foreign currency denominated assets as of december  of an estimated million in compared with an estimated decrease of million caused by the remeasurement of net foreign currency denominated liabilities at december  this sensitivity analysis was prepared based upon projected foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities as of december  and in  the company s yen denominated net cash inflow was approximately billion yen approximately million and its yen denominated liabilities exceeded its yen denominated assets by an average of billion yen approximately million compared with billion yen approximately million and billion yen approximately million  respectively  in in general  each time the yen strengthens weakens  the company s operating income is favorably unfavorably impacted due to net yen denominated revenues exceeding expenses and a non operating foreign currency loss gain is recognized due to the remeasurement of net yen denominated liabilities
