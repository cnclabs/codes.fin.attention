item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the principal objective of this discussion is to provide an overview of the financial condition and results of operations of financial institutions  inc and its subsidiaries for the three years ended december  this discussion and tabular presentations should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and are consistent with predominant practices in the financial services industry 
application of critical accounting policies  those policies that management believes are the most important to the company s financial position and results  requires management to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements 
future changes in information may affect these estimates  assumptions  and judgments  which  in turn  may affect amounts reported in the financial statements 
the company has numerous accounting policies  of which the most significant are presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this discussion  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are reported in the financial statements and how those reported amounts are determined 
based on the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions  and estimates underlying those amounts  management has determined that the accounting policies with respect to the allowance for loan losses and goodwill require subjective or complex judgments important to the company s financial position and results of operations  and  as such  are considered to be critical accounting policies as discussed below 
allowance for loan losses arriving at an appropriate level of allowance for loan losses involves a high degree of judgment 
the company s allowance for loan losses provides for probable losses based upon evaluations of known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
management uses historical information to assess the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and considers the prevailing business environment  as it is affected by changing economic conditions and various external factors  which may impact the portfolio in ways currently unforeseen 
the allowance is increased by provisions for loan losses and by recoveries of loans previously charged off and reduced by loans charged off 
for additional discussion related to the company s accounting policies for the allowance for loan losses  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements

nonaccrual loans and nonperforming assets the significant increase in nonperforming assets is primarily the result of recent deterioration in the commercial and agricultural loan portfolios at nbg and bnb

analysis of the allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents the estimated amount of probable credit losses inherent in the banks loan portfolios 
the company performs periodic  systematic reviews of its banks portfolios to identify these probable losses  and to assess the overall collectibility of these portfolios 
while in the past the company has relied on an outside loan review firm to perform loan reviews at each of the subsidiary banks  the hiring of a senior credit executive in september and the anticipated hiring of additional staff in will enable the company to perform these reviews using its own personnel 
in addition  the senior credit executive will review and oversee loan administration on a company wide basis to improve quality control and consistency in the application of company credit policies among the four subsidiary banks 
these reviews result in the identification and quantification of loss factors  which are used in determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses 
in addition  the company periodically evaluates prevailing economic and business conditions  industry concentrations  changes in the size and characteristics of the portfolio and other pertinent factors 
the allowance for loan losses is allocated to cover the estimated losses in each loan category based on the results of this detailed review 
the process used by the company to determine the overall allowance for loan losses is based on this analysis  taking into consideration management s judgment 
allowance methodology is reviewed on a periodic basis and modified as appropriate 
based on this analysis  the company believes that the allowance for loan losses is fairly stated at december  at december   the company s allowance for loan losses totaled million  an increase of million over the previous year end 
the allowance as a percentage of total loans was at december  and the ratio of allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans was at december  versus at december  the decline in this coverage ratio is a result of the previously discussed increase in nonperforming loans 
the company is actively monitoring these problem credits 
despite the decline in the ratio of allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans  the allowance for loan losses at december  represents the estimated probable losses in the loan portfolio based on the company s comprehensive assessment of collateral values and borrower paying capacity on impaired loans in excess of  together with the company s assessment of current economic conditions in the company s market area

investment securities represented of the growth in average earning assets and increased million or to million for the company s yield on average earning assets was for down basis points from the company s loan portfolio yield was and tax equivalent investment yield was for down basis points and basis points  respectively  from the principal reason for the decline in loan and investment yields was the reinvestment of investment portfolio cash flows and the acquisition of new loan assets at lower yields  reflective of the fall in overall market interest rates 
lower loan yields were influenced by tighter margins on loan products reflecting competitive pricing pressures as well as the impact of declining rates on variable rate loan products 
total average interest bearing liabilities were billion for the year ended december  representing a million increase over and represented of the average increased funding required to support the growth in average earning assets 
in there were significant changes to the mix of interest bearing liabilities with increases over in average savings and money market balances of million  average interest bearing checking balances of million  while certificates of deposit declined million 
the shift from certificates of deposit to savings  money market  and interest bearing checking deposits is related to the overall lower level of market interest rates  the company s deposit pricing strategies  and customer preference in deposit product selection 
as market interest rates have fallen the company has lowered the offering rates on certificates of deposits to a greater degree then on savings  money market  and interest bearing checking accounts 
the compression in the spread between the offering rates on these products as well as customer preference for deposit products with greater liquidity has contributed to the shift in deposit mix

net noninterest bearing funding sources represent the amount of zero interest cost funds such as demand deposits and equity that are available to fund earning assets after funding non interest earning assets 
coupling these zero interest cost net non interest bearing fund sources  which had no change in cost year over year  with interest bearing liabilities results in a total cost of funds for the company in of down basis points from the total cost of funds of 
the result of a basis point decline in earning asset yield while the cost of funds fell basis points was a drop of basis points in the net interest margin to in from in the growth in earning assets for mitigated the drop in net interest margin resulting in the increase of million in in net interest income

noninterest income increased to million in compared to million in service charges on deposit accounts increased significantly in  which reflects the benefit of the continued growth in core deposits and the related fee based products and services 
the increase in fsg fees and commissions results from figi  the company s brokerage subsidiary  commencing operations in march  enabling fii to retain a higher portion of commissions on mutual fund sales 
also  bgi was acquired during october and contributed to the increase 
the increase in mortgage banking activities results from the increase in the gain on sale of residential mortgage loans and an increase in the serviced loan portfolio 
noninterest expense the following table presents the major categories of noninterest expense during the years indicated year ended december dollars in thousands salaries and employee benefits    occupancy and equipment    supplies and postage    amortization of goodwill  amortization of other intangible assets computer and data processing   professional fees   other    total noninterest expense    noninterest expense increased to million in compared to million in the company s largest component of noninterest expense  salaries and employee benefits  increased in  a reflection of staffing additions from recent years acquisitions and other additions necessary to support the company s growth 
the increase also results from overhead coupled with integrating the newly acquired companies  expenditures associated with maintaining the company s investment in technology and costs connected with opening new branch offices 
in contrast  goodwill amortization expense recognized on the bnb acquisition  which amounted to million in  ceased on january  with the adoption of sfas no 
the company s efficiency ratio  which measures the amount of overhead required to produce a dollar of revenue  has remained at relatively low levels 
for the years ended december   and  the efficiency ratio was  and  respectively 
noninterest expense increased to million in compared to million in the increase was partially attributed to million in noninterest expense from the acquired companies  bnb and bgi 
the company s largest component of noninterest expense  salaries and employee benefits  increased in  a reflection of staffing additions from acquisitions and additions necessary to support the company s growth 
income tax expense the provision for income taxes provides for federal and new york state income taxes  which amounted to million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increasing trend corresponds generally to increased levels of taxable income 
the effective tax rate for was  compared to in and in the lower effective tax rate in is primarily attributable to the elimination of non deductible goodwill amortization expense recognized in segment information in accordance with the provisions of sfas no

the statement supersedes sfas no 
and is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  although early adoption is encouraged 
sfas no 
retains many of the fundamental principles of sfas no 
 but differs from it in that it excludes goodwill and intangible assets from its provisions and provides greater direction relating to the implementation of its principles 
the provisions of sfas no 
are not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 recission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no

none of the provisions of sfas no 
had or are expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas no 
requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december   with early application encouraged 
sfas no 
does not apply to costs associated with an exit activity that involves an entity newly acquired in a business combination 
the provisions of sfas no 
are not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in october  fasb issued sfas no 
 acquisitions of certain financial institutions  an amendment of fasb statements no 
and and fasb interpretation no 
sfas no 

this statement removes acquisitions of financial institutions from the scope of both statement no 
and interpretation no 
and requires that those transactions  which constitute a business combination  be accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
and sfas no 
thus  the requirement in paragraph of statement no 
to recognize and subsequently amortize any excess of the fair value of liabilities assumed over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired as an unidentifiable intangible asset no longer applies to acquisitions within the scope of sfas no 
sfas no 
also clarifies that an acquisition that does not meet the definition of a business combination because the transferred net assets and activities do not constitute a business is an acquisition of net assets 
those acquisitions should be accounted for in the same manner as any other net asset acquisition and do not give rise to goodwill 
sfas no 
is effective for acquisitions on or after october  with mandatory implementation effective january  for existing intangibles 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements

is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity the objective of maintaining adequate liquidity is to assure the ability of the company and its subsidiaries to meet their financial obligations 
these obligations include the withdrawal of deposits on demand or at their contractual maturity  the repayment of borrowings as they mature  the ability to fund new and existing loan commitments and the ability to take advantage of new business opportunities 
the company and its subsidiaries achieve liquidity by maintaining a strong base of core customer funds  maturing short term assets  the ability to sell securities  lines of credit  and access to capital markets 
liquidity at the subsidiary bank level is managed through the monitoring of anticipated changes in loans  core deposits  and wholesale funds 
the strength of the subsidiary bank s liquidity position is a result of its base of core customer deposits 
these core deposits are supplemented by wholesale funding sources which include credit lines with the other banking institutions  the fhlb  farmer mac  and the federal reserve bank 
the primary source of liquidity for the parent company is dividends from subsidiaries  lines of credit  and access to capital markets 
dividends from subsidiaries are limited by various regulatory requirements related to capital adequacy and earnings trends 
the company s subsidiaries rely on cash flows from operations  core deposits  borrowings  short term liquid assets  and  in the case of non banking subsidiaries  funds from the parent company 
in the normal course of business  the company has outstanding commitments to extend credit which are not reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements 
the commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
at december  letters of credit totaling million and unused loan commitments of million were contractually available 
comparable amounts for these commitments at december  were million and million  respectively 
the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements as many of the commitments are expected to expire without funding 
the company s cash and cash equivalents were million at december   a decrease of million from the balance of million at december  the primary factor leading to the decrease in cash relates to the company s more effective management of the federal reserve bank reserve requirements for the subsidiary banks 
capital resources the federal reserve board has adopted a system using risk based capital guidelines to evaluate the capital adequacy of bank holding companies 
the guidelines require a minimum total risk based capital ratio of 
leverage ratio is also utilized in assessing capital adequacy with a minimum requirement that can range from to 
the following table reflects the changes in the components of those ratios dollars in thousands total shareholders equity    less unrealized gains losses on securities available or sale   goodwill and other intangible assets    disallowed mortgage servicing asset plus minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries qualifying trust preferred securities   total tier capital    adjusted average assets    tier leverage ratio total tier capital    plus qualifying allowance for loan losses    nonqualifying trust preferred securities  total risk based capital    net risk weighted assets    total risk based capital ratio the company s tier leverage ratio was at december  and is well above minimum regulatory capital requirements 
the ratio declined slightly from at december  total tier capital of million at december  increased million from million at december  the increase in tier capital relates primarily to the increase in retained earnings resulting from net income of million and reduced by million in preferred and common dividends declared during the company s total risk weighted capital ratio was at december  and is well above minimum regulatory capital requirements 
the ratio declined slightly from at december  total risk based capital was million at december  an increase of million from million at december  the increase is attributed to the million increase in tier capital previously discussed plus a million increase in qualifying allowance for loan losses  offset by a million decrease in nonqualifying trust preferred securities 
the company and all subsidiary banks are well capitalized 
for further information related to regulatory capital see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the principal objective of the company s interest rate risk management is to evaluate the interest rate risk inherent in certain assets and liabilities  determine the appropriate level of risk to the company given its business strategy  operating environment  capital and liquidity requirements and performance objectives  and manage the risk consistent with the guidelines approved by the company s board of directors 
the company s senior management is responsible for reviewing with the board its activities and strategies  the effect of those strategies on the net interest margin  the fair value of the portfolio and the effect that changes in interest rates will have on the portfolio and exposure limits 
senior management develops an asset liability policy that meets strategic objectives and regularly reviews the activities of the subsidiary banks 
each subsidiary bank board adopts an asset liability policy within the parameters of the overall fii asset liability policy and utilizes an asset liability committee comprised of senior management of the bank under the direction of the bank s board 
the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring the company s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or re price within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or re pricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or re pricing within that same time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets 
at december   the one year gap position  the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or re pricing within one year and interest bearing liabilities maturing or re pricing within one year  was million  or of total assets 
accordingly  over the one year period following december   the company will have an estimated million more in assets re pricing than liabilities 
generally if rate sensitive assets re price sooner than rate sensitive liabilities  earnings will be positively impacted in a rising rate environment 
conversely  in a declining rate environment  earnings will generally be negatively impacted 
if rate sensitive liabilities re price sooner than rate sensitive assets then generally earnings will be negatively impacted in a rising rate environment 
conversely  in a declining rate environment earnings will generally be positively impacted 
management believes that the positive gap position at december  will not have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
gap analysis the following table the gap table sets forth the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december  which management anticipates  based upon certain assumptions  to re price or mature in each of the future time periods shown 
except as stated below  the amount of assets and liabilities shown which re price or mature during a particular period were determined in accordance with the earlier of the re pricing date or the contractual maturity of the asset or liability 
the table sets forth an approximation of the projected re pricing of assets and liabilities at december   on the basis of contractual maturities  anticipated prepayments and scheduled rate adjustments within the selected time intervals 
all non maturity deposits demand deposits and savings deposits were assumed to become rate sensitive over time  with     and of such deposits assumed to re price in the periods of less than days  to days  to days  to years  to years and more than years  respectively 
prepayment and re pricing rates can have a significant impact on the estimated gap 
while management believes the assumptions used in modeling the gap table are reasonable  there can be no assurances 
gap table december  volumes subject to repricing within non dollars in thousands days days days years years years sensitive total interest earning assets federal funds sold and and interest bearing deposits investment securities        loans         total interest earning assets         interest bearing liabilities interest bearing checking  savings and money market deposits        certificates of deposit        borrowed funds        total interest bearing liabilities        period gap         cumulative gap        period gap to total assets cumulative gap to total assets cumulative interest earning assets to cumulative interest bearing liabilities amounts shown include the amortized cost of held to maturity securities and the fair value of available for sale securities 
amounts shown include principal balance net of deferred loan fees and costs  unamortized premiums and discounts 
amounts shown include guaranteed preferred beneficial interests in corporation s junior subordinated debentures 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the gap table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate loans  have features which restrict changes in interest rates  both on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  in the event of changes in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
as a result of these shortcomings  the company directs more attention on simulation modeling  such as net interest income at risk discussed below  rather than gap analysis 
even though the gap analysis reflects a ratio of cumulative gap to total assets within acceptable limits  the net interest income at risk simulation modeling is considered by management to be more informative in forecasting future income at risk 
net interest income at risk analysis in addition to the gap analysis  management uses a rate shock simulation to measure the rate sensitivity of the balance sheet 
rate shock simulation is a modeling technique used to estimate the impact of changes in rates on net interest income and economic value of equity 
the following table sets forth the results of the modeling analysis at december  change in interest net interest income economic value of equity rates in basis points rate shock amount change change amount change change dollars in thousands static   the company measures net interest income at risk by estimating the changes in net interest income resulting from instantaneous and sustained parallel shifts in interest rates of plus or minus basis points over a period of months 
as of december   a basis point increase in rates would increase net interest income by million  or  over the next twelve month period 
conversely  a basis point decrease in rates would decrease net interest income by million  or  over a month period 
this simulation is based on management s assumption as to the effect of interest rate changes on assets and liabilities and assumes a parallel shift of the yield curve 
it also includes certain assumptions about the future pricing of loans and deposits in response to changes in interest rates 
further  it assumes that delinquency rates would not change as a result of changes in interest rates  although there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
while this simulation is a useful measure as to net interest income at risk due to a change in interest rates  it is not a forecast of the future results and is based on many assumptions that  if changed  could cause a different outcome
