the words expects  anticipates  believes  intends  will and similar expressions identify forward looking statements  which are based on information available to us on the date hereof  and we assume no obligation to update any such forward looking statements 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth in factors that may affect future operating results and elsewhere in this form k 
general inter tel  incorporated in  is a single point of contact  full service provider of converged voice and data business communications systems  voice mail systems and networking applications 
we market and sell voice processing and unified messaging software  call accounting software  internet protocol ip telephony software  computer telephone integration cti applications  local and long distance calling services  and other communications services 
our products and services include the axxess by inter tel  eclipse by inter tel and encore by inter tel business communication systems  with integrated voice processing and unified messaging systems  ip telephony voice and data routers  and e commerce software 
we also provide maintenance  leasing and support services for our products 
our customers include business enterprises  government agencies and non profit organizations 
our common stock is quoted on the nasdaq national market system under the symbol intl 
we have developed a distribution network of direct sales offices  dealers and value added resellers vars  which sell our products to organizations throughout the united states and internationally  including to divisions of fortune companies  large service organizations and governmental agencies 
as of december   we had direct sales offices in the united states and one in japan  and a network of hundreds of dealers and vars around the world that purchase directly from us 
we also maintain a wholesale distribution office in the united kingdom that supplies inter tel s dealers and distributors throughout the uk and parts of europe 
in december  we also acquired swan solutions limited  a research and development and software sales office in the united kingdom 
sales of systems through our dealers and vars typically generate lower gross margins than sales through our direct sales organization  although direct sales typically require higher levels of selling  general and administrative expenses 
in addition  our long distance services and datanet products typically generate lower gross margins than sales of software and system products 
accordingly  our margins may vary from period to period depending upon distribution channel and product mix 
in the event that sales through dealers or sales of long distance services increase as a percentage of net sales  our overall gross margin could decline 
our operating results depend upon a variety of factors  including the volume and timing of orders received during a period  the mix of products sold and the mix of distribution channels  general economic conditions  patterns of capital spending by customers  the timing of new product announcements and releases by us and our competitors  pricing pressures  the cost and effect of acquisitions and the availability and cost of products and components from our suppliers 
historically  a substantial portion of our net sales in a given quarter has been recorded in the third month of the quarter  with a concentration of such net sales in the last two weeks of the quarter 
in addition  we are subject to seasonal variations in our operating results  as net sales for the first and third quarters are frequently less than those experienced during the fourth and second quarters  respectively 
the markets we serve have been characterized by rapid technological changes and increasing customer requirements 
we have sought to address these requirements through the development of software enhancements and improvements to existing systems and the introduction of new systems  products  and applications 
inter tel s research and development efforts over the last several years have been focused primarily on the development of  and enhancements to  our axxess and eclipse systems  including adding new applications  incorporating ip convergence applications and ip telephones  developing unified messaging software applications  developing speech recognition and text to speech applications  developing and enhancing call center applications  developing unified communications software applications  and expanding the telecommunications networking package to include networking over ip and frame relay networks 
inter tel s current efforts are focused on developing and enhancing the convergence applications for our axxess and eclipse systems  enhancing our server pbx offering  enhancing our unified communications applications  developing new ip endpoint technology  and enhancing our call center applications 
we offer to our customers a package of lease financing and other services under the name total solution formerly  totalease

net sales decreased to million in from million in  representing a decrease of million 
the decrease in net sales was primarily attributable to the fact that sales from inter tel 
net of which inter tel sold of its interest in july were not included in inter tel 
net sales were million in sales from our direct sales offices were relatively flat in compared to including sales from mcleod offices acquired in excluding the mcleod acquisition  sales in this division declined by approximately 
sales from our government and national accounts division decreased million  or  in compared to the datanet division  which sells networking products through our direct sales offices  government and national accounts division and dealer channel  was purchased in the mcleod acquisition  and accounted for million in sales in sales to our dealer network decreased by in  due primarily to the impact of the mcleod acquisition  since  prior to  mcleod was a dealer that purchased million from inter tel in excluding the mcleod acquisition  sales to the dealer network increased 
sales from our long distance resale and network services divisions increased million in compared to net sales from lease financing increased in compared to and international revenues increased by less than in compared to since july   the date of the sale of of inter tel 
net  we have used the cost method of accounting for our remaining investment in inter tel 
net comm services 
accordingly  we have not recorded revenues or expenses of inter tel 
net since the date of sale 
the reduction in sales attributable to inter tel 
net was due entirely to our sale of of this subsidiary 
the decrease in net sales from our direct sales offices  government and national accounts division and dealer channel was also attributable to delayed customer buying decisions related to a continued deterioration in industry and macroeconomic conditions  among other factors as follows 
inter tel recognized lower revenues due to lower sales volumes of systems collectively through the direct sales offices  government and national accounts group and dealer channel  offset in part by sales increases in our long distance and network services divisions  sales from acquired mcleod operations  and to a lesser extent  lease finance and international operations 
in some instances  prices of various telecommunications systems decreased  and discounts or other highly competitive promotions that were offered to customers to generate sales resulted in lower revenues through both our direct and indirect channels 
sales of communications systems were heavily impacted by delayed buying decisions  in particular in our national accounts division and direct sales offices 
although sales to new customers declined during  recurring revenues to existing customers increased as a percentage of total sales 
sales from long distance and network services increased in compared to and represented the divisions with our largest percentage sales increases 
sales increased in our long distance division by  despite downward price pressure and significant competition 
increased sales volume has allowed netsolutions  our long distance resale division  to offer more competitive pricing  which improved sales to our existing customer base 
network services revenues increased in compared to  on higher volume of sales and commissions on local and network services such as t access  frame relay and other voice and data circuit services 
please refer to note p of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional segment reporting information 
gross profit 
gross profit increased to million  or of net sales in  from million  or of net sales  in the increases in gross profit and gross margins were the result of several different factors 
gross profit and gross margin in improved as a result of no longer including the results of inter tel 
net  which experienced negative gross margins of million during gross profit and margins also increased in as compared to as a result of a higher proportion of recurring revenues from existing customers  including increased maintenance and services revenues as a percentage of total sales  higher software content in our products  cost containment efforts  product design improvements  efficiencies achieved with our manufacturing vendors and a more favorable sales channel mix 
during  recurring revenues from existing customers in our direct sales and national and government accounts channels increased as a percentage of total sales from these same channels from approximately in to more than in existing customers accounted for a significant portion of our net sales from maintenance and other services  software additions and or upgrades  support  training and hardware products such as video conferencing  headsets wired and wireless  networking products and speakerphones 
our business communications platforms allow for system migration without the complete change out of hardware  which enables us to offer enhancements and new solutions through software only upgrades to our existing customers 
our gross margins are generally higher with recurring revenues because we incur less materials costs relative to new installations 
accordingly  our gross profit and margins improved in as a result of this recurring revenue percentage increase 
sales from netsolutions increased by  or million  compared to although gross margins are generally lower in this division than our consolidated margins  the margins improved slightly in relative to  based in part on our ability to negotiate more favorable pricing with vendors on higher resale volumes 
in addition  sales from our network services division increased  or million  in compared to this division generally receives commissions on network services we sell as an agent for rbocs 
these sales carry little to no equipment costs and generated margins of approximately in the increase in sales from this division therefore improved our consolidated gross profit and margins 
the increases in gross margin noted above were offset in part by continued competitive pricing pressures in our direct sales offices  government and national accounts and dealer channels in  including pricing discounts or special competitor promotions on telephone system and software sales and related equipment 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased to million  or of net sales in  from million  or of net sales in the increase is attributable in large part to the acquisitions of mastermind in late october and swan in early december the increase is also attributable  to a lesser extent  to increased research and development spending related to convergence applications and new ip endpoint development 
in  research and development expenses were directed principally toward the continued development of the axxess and eclipse software and systems including versions and  unified messaging and voice processing software  speech recognition and text to speech applications  call center applications  unified communications applications  ip endpoint development  and certain cti and ivr applications 
we expect that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we continue to develop and enhance existing and new technologies and products 
these expenses may vary  however  as a percentage of net sales 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased slightly in absolute dollars to million in  compared to million in however  these expenses increased as a percentage of net sales to in compared to in this decrease in absolute dollars was primarily due to the reduction in total net sales of million in compared to the increase in these expenses as a percentage of net sales is in large part attributable to the sale of of inter tel 
net operations in july selling  general and administrative expenses for inter tel 
net were of net sales when compared to the consolidated average 
accordingly  when these operations were no longer included in our consolidated results  our selling  general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of net sales 
inter tel 
net incurred selling  general and administrative expenses  excluding amortization  of million during excluding the operations of inter tel 
net for comparative purposes  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales reflecting the lower percentage of total sales generated through our combined direct sales offices and government and national accounts divisions  including the acquired mcleod operations in january selling  general and administrative expenses also decreased as a percentage of net sales due to lower depreciation and bad debt costs relative to total sales 
in addition  the growth in sales from the resale of long distance calling services and datanet products led to lower selling  general and administrative costs relative to total sales 
we expect that for the foreseeable future selling  general and administrative expenses will increase sequentially in absolute dollars assuming that we increase sales and continue to enhance existing and develop new technologies and products 
these expenses may vary  however  as a percentage of net sales 
amortization of goodwill and purchased intangible assets 
we adopted sfas no 
effective the beginning of fiscal in accordance with sfas  we ceased amortizing goodwill 
we are required to perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances 
as of december   no impairment of goodwill has been recognized 
there can be no assurance that future goodwill impairment tests will not result in a charge to earnings 
although amortization of goodwill ceased for  goodwill amortization totaled million in  reflecting amortization from acquisitions completed prior to for additional information regarding sfas  see goodwill and other intangible assets in note a of notes to consolidated financial statements 
amortization of purchased intangible assets included in operating expenses was million in compared to  for the increases in the amortization of purchased intangible assets for compared to was primarily related to the additional amortization from recent acquisitions 
for additional information regarding purchased intangible assets  see note a goodwill and other intangible assets and note b acquisitions  dispositions and restructuring charges to consolidated financial statements 
other charges 
we recorded no charges in in connection with the sale of percent of our interest in inter tel 
net in july  we recorded a pre tax charge or million during  which reduced net income by million  or per share after tax 
this charge was associated with the impairment of our remaining investment in inter tel 
net 
the impairment was measured as the difference between the carrying value of inter tel s remaining interest in inter tel 
net and the estimated fair market value of the interest 
litigation settlement  net of costs except taxes 
in may  inter tel entered into an agreement to submit to binding arbitration a lawsuit we filed in the arbitration was completed in january and  as a result of the arbitration  inter tel received a one time gross cash award of million in february direct costs for attorney s fees  expert witness costs  arbitration costs and additional payments and expenses  totaled approximately million in  excluding income taxes  for a net award of approximately million 
the estimated net proceeds from this arbitration settlement were approximately million after taxes  or per diluted share for the year ended december  interest and other income 
in the other component of this caption included an expense of approximately million related to the write down of inter tel s investment in inter tel 
net vianet 
other than the write down  other income in all periods consisted primarily of interest income and foreign currency transaction gains and losses 
interest and other income increased approximately  in compared to based on a higher level of invested funds  due in part to cash received from the litigation settlement noted above  offset by expenditures relating to the mcleod and swan acquisitions 
during  we recognized foreign currency transaction gains of  an improvement of  compared to losses of  in interest expense was  in  a decrease of  compared to  in  due primarily to reduced interest on capital leases held by inter tel 
net  of which was sold in july income taxes 
our effective income tax rate for increased to compared to for the rate increased primarily as a result of higher marginal tax rates anticipated from higher net income 
we expect the full year tax rates to be comparable to or slightly higher than the effective tax rate for net income loss 
net income for  including the litigation settlement in  increased to million  or per diluted share  compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  including the charge for the impairment of the investment in inter tel 
net 
excluding the litigation settlement  we would have reported net income of million  or per diluted share in excluding both the charge and entire business operations of inter tel 
net  we reported net income of million  or per diluted share  in the increase is the result of higher gross profit and increased operating efficiencies described in further detail above

net was due primarily to our sale of of inter tel 
net on july  accordingly  less than seven months of activity from inter tel 
net was reflected in the results as compared to the full year results of inter tel 
net reported in the decrease in net sales was also attributable to delayed customer buying decisions in related to a deterioration in macroeconomic conditions 
inter tel recognized lower revenues due to lower sales volumes of systems collectively through the direct sales offices  government and national accounts group  dealer channel and foreign operations  offset partially by sales increases in our lease finance operations 
in some instances  prices of various telecommunications systems decreased  and discounts or other promotions that were offered to customers to generate sales resulted in lower revenues

gross profit 
gross profit increased to million  or of net sales in  from million  or of net sales in excluding the executone restructuring charge  gross profit increased compared to million  or of net sales in this increase in gross profit was primarily a result of lower sales from inter tel 
net  which experienced negative gross margins  an increase in sales  as a percentage of consolidated net sales  through our direct sales channel compared to our dealer network  reduced product costs and higher relative recurring revenues 
gross profit also increased as a percentage of net sales  due in large part to the factors described in net sales above 
greater competitive pricing pressures and pricing discounts on telephone system sales offset these increases in excluding the operations of inter tel 
net  gross profit for increased to million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales  in inter tel 
net generated negative gross profit of million in compared to negative million in research and development 
research and development expenses decreased to million  or of net sales in  from million  or of net sales in this decline is attributable in large part to the closure of the executone research and development operations in milford  connecticut in july accordingly  our costs did not reflect the executone expenses  compared to seven months of activity in in  research and development expenses were directed principally toward the continued development of the digital axxess and eclipse software and systems including version  unified messaging and voice processing software  interprise ip router solutions  talk to agent web e commerce solutions  speech recognition and text to speech applications  and certain cti and ivr applications 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million  or of net sales in  from million  or of net sales in the increase in these expenses reflected an increase in costs associated with sales through our direct office channels compared to our dealer network  increased reserves for accounts receivable  and an increase in costs of maintaining additional facilities  including our new facilities in the phoenix metro area and the convergent offices acquired in january excluding the operations of inter tel 
net  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million  or of net sales for  compared to million  or of net sales in excluding charges  inter tel 
net incurred selling  general and administrative expenses of million in compared to million in other charges 
in connection with the sale of our interest in inter tel 
net in july  we recorded a pre tax charge or million during  which reduced net income by million  or per share after tax 
this charge was associated with the impairment of our investment in inter tel 
net 
the impairment was measured as the difference between the carrying value of inter tel s interest in inter tel 
net and the estimated fair market value of the interest in the net assets of inter tel 
net 
we reported pre tax charges of million during  which reduced net income by million  or per share after tax 
these pre tax charges reflected the write off of the executone acquisition of million in the second quarter  the write off of in process research and development in connection with the executone purchase of million during the first quarter  the write down to net realizable value of inter tel 
net assets of million during the second quarter  the equity share of cirilium s losses of million for the year  and write off of inter tel s investment in cirilium of million including reserve adjustments during the third quarter 
without these charges  we would have reported net income of million per diluted share for the year ended december  charges and in process research and development 
we reported a pre tax charge of million during  which reduced net income by million  or per share after tax 
this pre tax charge reflected the sale of of our interest in inter tel 
net and the write down of our investment in inter tel 
net to anticipated net realizable value 
without this charges  we would have reported net income of million per diluted share for the year ended december  interest and other income 
other income in both periods consisted primarily of interest income and foreign currency transaction gains and losses 
interest and other income decreased  in compared to the same period in principally as a result of lower levels of cash available for investment 
during  we recognized foreign currency transaction losses of  compared to losses of  in interest expense was  in compared to  in  primarily attributable to debt from assets financed for inter tel 
net operations 
this debt was transferred upon the sale of of inter tel 
net in july income taxes benefit 
the effective income tax rate increased to compared to for the rate was lower in because we received no tax benefits for a component of the cirilium losses that were capital losses during lower tax benefits were received to apply to net losses 
net income loss 
including the charge recorded in  net income increased to million  or 
per diluted share  in compared to net loss of million  or a net loss of per diluted share  in reflecting the charges noted above associated with the executone  cirilium and inter tel 
net operations 
excluding the charges  net income would have been million  or 
per diluted share  in excluding the charges  all cirilium losses and operations of inter tel 
net  the company reported net income of million  or per diluted share  in  compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  in and other charges 
set forth herein is a further description of the items reflected in other charges during the years ended december  and inter tel 
net comm services vianet 
during the second quarter of  inter tel recorded a pre tax charge associated with inter tel 
net operations of million million after tax  related to the write down to net realizable value of network equipment and lease termination costs of certain redundant facilities 
the reserves established at the time of the write down have been fully utilized as of december  on july   inter tel sold of the stock of inter tel 
net  inc to comm services corporation for a note of million  collateralized by comm services stock  other marketable securities of the shareholders of comm services and of the net assets of inter tel 
net 
in connection with the sale of of inter tel 
net  we assessed the fair value of the remaining investment in inter tel 
net 
pursuant to sfas  we recorded a charge as of the close of the second quarter of of million million after tax associated with the impairment of our investment in inter tel 
net 
after the impairment charge  the carrying value of our investment the note receivable from comm services plus the ownership interest in comm services totaled million as of december  the charge was primarily non cash 
inter tel s management has not participated in the management of inter tel 
net since the sale in july as a result  since july   we have accounted for the remaining inter tel 
net comm services investment using the cost method of accounting 
on december   comm services entered into a merger agreement with vianet 
inter tel s investment in comm services was converted to approximately of vianet stock and as a result  the loan for the purchase was assumed by vianet and inter tel continued to hold collateral from the former shareholders of comm services until march during  the net investment in the notes receivable and interest in vianet formerly comm services was written down by million and was recorded in other assets at a carrying value of approximately million as of december   which approximated management s estimate of the related collateral value at that time 
during  and  inter tel 
net entered into operating lease agreements totaling approximately million from an equipment vendor for network equipment and software 
the lease agreements required inter tel 
net to purchase vendor maintenance on their products 
inter tel originally guaranteed the indebtedness 
in february  we executed an agreement with vianet and this vendor releasing inter tel from its guarantee of any and all of these obligations  and inter tel and vianet released the vendor from claims arising from the failure of the network equipment and software previously leased 
as part of this agreement  inter tel also received payment from the vianet shareholders of million  in exchange for the release of the remaining collateral and as payment of the loan 
inter tel also retained a collateral interest in a vianet shareholder s variable forward option contract that matures in july for an amount up to  we have not recorded an asset for this right as the amount is not guaranteed or reasonably estimable based on the fluctuations of future stock prices 
the value received in this transaction was equivalent to our remaining investment value  less accruals for potential obligations to the vendor discussed above 
inter tel also retains its ownership interest in vianet and will account for the remaining investment interest of approximately in vianet using the cost method of accounting 
executone 
on january  inter tel purchased certain computer telephony assets and assumed certain liabilities of executone information systems  inc executone 
the executone transaction was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
the aggregate purchase price was allocated to the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired  of which million million after taxes was written off as purchased in process research and development 
in connection with the executone acquisition  we sold executone s manufacturing assets and liabilities to varian of tempe  arizona at a net book value of million 
during the second quarter of  we decided to close the primary executone facility in milford  connecticut and to recognize a restructuring charge related to our exit plan and closure of the executone operations 
we have accounted for the restructuring of the executone operations  including severance and related costs  the shut down and consolidation of the milford facility and the impairment of assets associated with the restructuring 
we finalized our plan for the exiting of activities and the involuntary termination or relocation of the employees 
accrued costs associated with this plan were estimates  although the original estimates made for the second quarter of for reserve balances have not changed significantly as of december  exit costs associated with the closure of the milford facility also included liabilities for building  furniture and equipment lease  and other contractual obligations 
we are liable for the lease on the milford buildings through january various other furniture  computer and equipment leases terminated on varying dates through september to date  we have entered into sublease agreements with third parties to sublease portions of the facility 
the reserve for lease and other contractual obligations is identified in the table below 
the total restructuring charge from this event totaled million

inflation currency fluctuation inflation and currency fluctuations have not previously had a material impact on inter tel s operations 
international procurement agreements have traditionally been denominated in us currency 
moreover  a significant amount of contract manufacturing has been or is expected to be moved to alternative sources 
the expansion of international operations in the united kingdom and europe and increased sales  if any  in japan and other parts of asia could result in higher international sales as a percentage of total revenues  however  international revenues do not currently represent a significant portion of our total revenues 
liquidity and capital resources at december   cash and equivalents and short term investments totaled million  which represented an increase of approximately million from the million total at december  we maintain a million unsecured  revolving line of credit with bankone  na  which is available through june  under the credit facility  we have the option to borrow at a prime rate or adjusted libor interest rate 
historically  we have used the credit facility primarily to support international letters of credit to suppliers and we intend to renew this facility again in during the year ended december   we received approximately million in net after tax proceeds million pre tax and net of related expenses from the settlement of an arbitration claim refer to litigation settlement in management s discussion and analysis  year ended december  versus year ended december  
during the year ended december   we expended approximately  to repurchase our common stock  compared to million used to repurchase common stock in during  we expended million to fund acquisitions  compared to million in a portion of our cash balances may be used for  among other things  acquisitions  strategic alliances  working capital and general corporate purposes 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in cash provided by operating activities in primarily resulted from net income plus non cash charges for depreciation and amortization expenses and provision for losses on receivables and leases 
cash generated by the change in operating assets and liabilities in was million  compared to cash generated by the change in operating assets and liabilities of million in at december   we achieved lower net accounts receivable  inventory  prepaid expenses and other current assets than at december   which was primarily a result of close management of receivables and inventory and working down elevated levels of working capital assets acquired in the executone acquisition 
we expect to expand sales through our direct sales office and dealer networks  which is expected to require the expenditure of working capital for increased accounts receivable and inventories 
net cash used in investing activities totaled million  primarily in the form of acquisitions and capital expenditures  as well as million used to purchase short term investments net of sales and maturities  compared to net cash used in investing activities of million in  including million used to purchase short term investments 
cash used in acquisitions and investments in joint ventures totaled approximately million in compared to million in capital expenditures totaled approximately million for compared to million in net cash used in investing activities in was partially offset by cash received of million from the disposition of the manufacturing operations of executone 
we anticipate additional capital expenditures during  principally relating to expenditures for equipment and management information systems used in operations  facilities expansion and acquisition activities 
net cash provided by financing activities totaled million during compared to the use of million in we expended approximately  and million for stock repurchases during and  respectively  funded by existing cash balances during each period 
repayment of our long term debt for the year was  while we issued long term debt  net of repayments  of million in primarily in the form of long term capital leases to support capital additions to inter tel 
net prior to our divestiture of our majority ownership in july  during  we reissued treasury shares through stock option exercises and issuances  with the proceeds received totaling less than the cost basis of the treasury stock reissued 
accordingly  the difference was recorded as a reduction to retained earnings 
net cash used for cash dividends totaled million in and million during cash provided by the exercise of stock options and stock issuances pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan totaled million in and million in we offer to our customers lease financing and other services  including our total solution formerly totalease program  through our inter tel leasing  inc subsidiary 
we fund our total solution program in part through the sale to financial institutions of rental payment streams under the leases 
sold lease rentals totaling and million remained unbilled at december  and december   respectively 
we are obligated to repurchase such income streams in the event of defaults by lease customers and  accordingly  maintain reserves based on loss experience and past due accounts 
although we to date have been able to resell the rental streams from leases under the total solution program profitably and on a substantially current basis  the timing and profitability of lease resales could impact our business and operating results  particularly in an environment of fluctuating interest rates and economic uncertainty 
if we are required to repurchase rental streams and realize losses thereon in amounts exceeding our reserves  our operating results will be adversely affected 
we believe that our working capital and credit facilities  together with cash generated from operations  will be sufficient to develop and expand our business operations  to finance acquisitions of additional resellers of telephony products and other strategic acquisitions or corporate alliances  and to provide adequate working capital for at least the next twelve months 
however  to the extent that additional funds are required in the future to address working capital needs and to provide funding for capital expenditures  expansion of the business or additional acquisitions  we will seek additional financing 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available when required or on acceptable terms 
contractual obligations we had the following contractual obligations outstanding as of december  amount of commitment expiration per period in thousands less than after total year years years years operating lease obligations  primarily for     building and equipment leases letters of credit critical accounting policies and estimates the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our experience and assumptions form the basis for our judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may vary from what we anticipate and different assumptions or estimates about the future could change our reported results 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to us  in that they are important to the portrayal of our financial statements and they require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue pursuant to staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition in financial statements 
accordingly  revenue is recognized when all four of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence that arrangement exists  ii delivery of the products and or services has occurred  iii the selling price is both fixed and determinable and  iv collectibility is reasonably probable 
revenue derived from sales of systems and services to end user customers is recognized upon installation of the systems and performance of the services  respectively  allowing for use by our customers of these systems 
pre payments for communications services are deferred and recognized as revenue as the communications services are provided 
for shipments to dealers and other distributors  our revenues are recorded as products are shipped and services are rendered  because the sales process is complete 
these shipments are primarily to third party dealers and distributors  and title passes when goods are shipped free on board shipping point 
long distance services revenues are recognized as service is provided 
sales leases 
for our sales type lease accounting  we follow the guidance provided by fasb statement no 
 accounting for leases and fasb statement no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities a replacement of fasb statement no 
we record the discounted present values of minimum rental payments under sales type leases as sales  net of provisions for continuing administration and other expenses over the lease period 
we record the lease sales at the time of system sale and installation pursuant to staff accounting bulletin no 
 as discussed above for sales to end user customers  and upon receipt of the executed lease documents 
the costs of systems installed under these sales leases  net of residual values at the end of the lease periods  are recorded as costs of sales 
the net rental streams are sold to funding sources on a regular basis with the income streams discounted by prevailing like term rates at the time of sale 
gains or losses resulting from the sale of net rental payments from such leases are recorded as net sales 
we establish and maintain reserves against potential recourse following the resales based upon historical loss experience  past due accounts and specific account analysis 
the allowance for uncollectible minimum lease payments and recourse liability at the end of the year represent reserves against the entire lease portfolio 
management reviews the adequacy of the allowance on a regular basis and adjusts the allowance as required 
these reserves are either netted in the accounts receivable  current and long term components of net investments in sales leases on the balance sheet  or included in long term liabilities on our balance sheet for off balance sheet leases 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
we assess the impairment of goodwill and other identifiable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
some factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant under performance relative to historical  expected or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  our market capitalization relative to net book value  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of goodwill and other identified intangibles may not be recoverable  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on january   we ceased amortizing goodwill arising from acquisitions completed prior to july  inter tel has tested goodwill for impairment using the two step process prescribed in sfas the first step is a screen for potential impairment  while the second step measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
inter tel has performed the first of the required impairment tests for goodwill as of october  and has determined that the carrying amount of goodwill is not impaired 
inter tel has adopted sfas effective january  application of the nonamortization provisions of sfas resulted in an increase in income from continuing operations before income taxes of approximately million in allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
additional reserves or allowances for doubtful accounts are recorded for our sales type leases  discussed above in sales leases 
we establish and maintain reserves against estimated losses based upon historical loss experience  past due accounts and specific account analysis 
management reviews the level of the allowances for doubtful accounts on a regular basis and adjusts the level of the allowances as needed 
at december   our allowance for doubtful accounts for accounts receivable were million of our million in gross accounts receivable 
if the financial condition of our customers or channel partners were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventories 
we value our inventories at lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by the first in  first out fifo method  including material  labor and factory overhead 
significant management judgment is required to determine the reserve for obsolete or excess inventory 
inventory on hand may exceed future demand either because the product is outdated  or obsolete  or because the amount on hand is more than can be used to meet future need  or excess 
we currently consider all inventory that has no activity within one year as well as any additional specifically identified inventory to be excess 
we also provide for the total value of inventories that we determine to be obsolete based on criteria such as customer demand  product life cycles  changing technologies and market conditions 
we write down our excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value 
at december   our inventory reserves were million of our million gross inventories 
if actual customer demand  product life cycles  changing technologies and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
contingencies 
we are a party to various claims and litigation in the normal course of business 
management s current estimated range of liability related to various claims and pending litigation is based on claims for which our management can estimate the amount and range of loss 
because of the uncertainties related to both the amount and range of loss on the remaining pending claims and litigation  management is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome 
as additional information becomes available  we will assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates 
such revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operations and financial position 
divisions of the united states department of justice are investigating other companies and inter tel s participation in a federally funded e rate program to connect schools and libraries to the internet 
the justice department has not provided inter tel with a description of the evidence on which the investigations are based 
inter tel is presently unable to predict or determine the final outcome of  or to estimate the potential range of loss if any with respect to  the investigations 
if inter tel is convicted of any crime or subjected to sanctions  or if penalties  damages or other monetary remedies are assessed against inter tel in connection with any investigations  our business and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
based upon the information known at this time  we do not expect the investigations to result in a material adverse impact upon the company s business or financial condition 
nevertheless  the early nature of the investigations makes it difficult to determine whether the likelihood of a material adverse outcome is unlikely

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments 
investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our non trading investment portfolio 
inter tel maintains a portfolio of highly liquid cash equivalents typically maturing in three months or less as of the date of purchase 
inter tel places its investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards  as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
the company also maintains short term investments  which are all classified as available for sale  and have been recorded at fair value  which approximates cost 
short term investments include certificates of deposit  auction rate certificates  auction rate preferred securities  municipal preferred securities and mutual funds 
the auction rate securities are adjustable rate securities with dividend rates that are reset periodically by bidders through periodic dutch auctions generally conducted every to days by a trust company or broker dealer on behalf of the issuer 
the company believes these securities are highly liquid investments through the related auctions  however  the collateralizing securities have stated terms of up to thirty years 
these instruments are rated a or higher by standard poor s ratings group  or equivalent 
the company s short term investments are intended to establish a high quality portfolio that preserves principal  meets liquidity needs  avoids inappropriate concentrations and delivers an appropriate yield in relationship to the company s investment guidelines and market conditions 
given the short term nature of these investments  and that we have no borrowings outstanding other than short term letters of credit  we are not subject to significant interest rate risk 
lease portfolio 
we offer to our customers lease financing and other services  including our total solutions program  through our inter tel leasing subsidiary 
we fund these programs in part through the sale to financial institutions of rental payment streams under the leases 
upon the sale of the rental payment streams  we continue to service the leases and maintain limited recourse on the leases 
we maintain reserves for loan losses on all leases based on historical loss experience  past due accounts and specific account analysis 
although to date we have been able to resell the rental streams from leases under our lease programs profitably and on a substantially current basis  the timing and profitability of lease resales could impact our business and operating results  particularly in an environment of fluctuating interest rates and economic uncertainty 
if we were required to repurchase rental streams and realize losses thereon in amounts exceeding our reserves  our operating results could be materially adversely affected 
see liquidity and capital resources in management s discussion and analysis and notes a and d of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our lease portfolio and financing 
impact of foreign currency rate changes 
we invoice the customers of our international subsidiaries primarily in the local currencies of our subsidiaries for product and service revenues 
inter tel is exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
the impact of foreign currency rate changes have historically been insignificant
