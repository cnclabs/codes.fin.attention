item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis relates to our financial condition and results of operations of the company for each of the years ended december   and this discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected historical consolidated financial data and the company s consolidated financial statements and the notes related thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a leading facilities based provider of integrated telecommunications and internet services to businesses and other high usage customers and telecommunications operators in moscow  kiev  st 
petersburg  nizhny novgorod and other major population centers throughout russia and other countries of the commonwealth of independent states cis 
we organize our operations into the four business groups  as follows o competitive local exchange carrier clec services 
using our local access overlay networks in moscow  kiev  st 
petersburg and nizhny novgorod  we provide a range of services including local exchange and access services  international and domestic long distance services  data communications  internet access and the design of corporate networks  o data and internet services 
using our fiber optic and satellite based networks  including combined points of presence in russia  ukraine and other countries of the commonwealth of independent states  we provide data and internet services including a business to business services  such as data communications  dedicated internet access  web design  web hosting  co location and data warehousing and b business to consumer services  such as dial up internet access and web content offered through a family of internet portals  o long distance services 
using our fiber optic and satellite based network  we provide long distance voice services in russia  and o mobile services 
using our mobile networks in kiev and odessa  ukraine  we provide mobile services with value added features  such as voicemail  roaming and messaging services on a subscription and prepaid basis 
we offer all of our integrated telecommunication services under the golden telecom brand and our internet services under the rol brand in russia 
additionally  we hold a minority interest in mct corp 
mct  which in turn has ownership interests in mobile operations located throughout russia and in uzbekistan and tajikistan 
we treat our ownership interest in mct as an equity method investment and are not actively involved in the day to day management of the operations 
in july  we merged the existing operations of agentstvo delovoi svyazi ads  commercial information network kis and teleross nizhny novgorod to create the leading corporate telecommunications provider in russia s third largest city  nizhny novgorod 
this market is significantly less developed than the moscow market and we anticipate significant growth next year from this entity 
we previously owned of ads  of kis and of teleross nizhny novgorod 
as a result of the merger  we currently own of the merged operations 
most of our revenue is derived from high volume business customers and carriers 
our business customers include large multi national companies  local enterprises  financial institutions  hotels and government agencies 
we believe that the carriers  including mobile operators  which contribute a substantial portion of our revenues  in turn derive a portion of their business from high volume business customers 
thus  we believe that the majority of our ultimate end users are businesses that require access to highly reliable and advanced telecommunications facilities to sustain their operations 
we have traditionally competed for customers on the basis of network quality  customer service and range of service offered 
in the past several years  other telecommunications operators have also introduced high quality services to the segments of the business market in which we operate 
competition with these operators is intense  and frequently results in declining prices for some of our services  which adversely affect our revenues 
in addition  some of our competitors do not link their prices to the dollar ruble exchange rate  so when the ruble devalues  their prices effectively become relatively cheaper than our prices 
the ruble exchange rate with the dollar has become relatively stable since early and price pressures associated with devaluation have eased considerably 
we cannot be certain that the exchange rate will remain stable in the future and therefore we may experience additional price pressures 
since early  we have witnessed a recovery in the russian market  but with downward pricing pressures persisting 
the downward pricing pressures result from increased competition in russia and the global trend toward lower telecommunications tariffs 
in and our traffic volume increases exceeded the reduction in tariffs on certain types of voice traffic 
this is a contributory factor to the increases in our revenue in and we expect that this trend of year over year increases in traffic volume will continue as long as the russian economy continues to develop at its current pace 
although we expect competition to continue to force the general level of tariffs downward  we expect to mitigate partially the effects of this pressure by seeking  where possible  further reductions in the settlement and interconnection rates that we pay to other telecommunications operators 
in general  over time we expect settlement and interconnection rates to continue to decline broadly in line with tariffs 
in order to handle additional traffic volumes  we have expanded and will continue to expand our fiber optic capacity along our heavy traffic and high cost routes to mitigate declines in traffic margins  reduce our unit transmission costs and ensure sufficient capacity to meet the growing demand for data and internet services 
as part of this strategy  we have acquired the rights to use stm fiber optic capacity on a moscow to stockholm route  significantly reducing our unit cost per e fiber optic link on this route 
in september  we acquired rights to use up to vc fiber optic capacity on major routes within russia to support the increase in our interregional traffic and our regional expansion strategy 
we expect to continue to add additional transmission capacity  which due to its fixed cost nature can initially depress margins  but will ultimately allow us to improve or maintain our margins 
during  our mobile operations in ukraine were under strong competitive pressure and average revenue per subscriber declined 
in the fourth quarter of we reassessed our plans for this business and as a result we recorded an impairment charge of million 
in line with our expectations revenues have generally continued to decline  although  at the same time  we have commenced the implementation of a cost reduction program 
we currently are working towards refocusing our mobile operations as an additional service offered by business services operations to corporate clients 
further significant declines are not expected through the end of in kiev  ukraine we continue to experience issues relating to obtaining sufficient numbering capacity for our business services operations 
in this regard  we are continuing negotiations with ukrtelecom  the state owned operator  for performance of obligations related to the provision of numbering capacity and entered into an agreement for additional numbering capacity in the third quarter of our ability to grow our business services operations in kiev will be limited if we do not have access to numbering capacity 
during the past year  golden telecom ukraine gtu was involved in a number of commercial disputes with ukrtelecom and ukrainian regulatory authorities 
the most significant disputes include routing of traffic and gtu s lease rights of ukrtelecom s technical premises 
at the end of the fourth quarter of  most of these issues with ukrtelecom were resolved 
we continue to work with ukrtelecom to resolve the remaining outstanding issues 
we reassessed and suspended our incoming international traffic off network termination activities  pending the resolution of certain regulatory issues and as a result we estimate a reduction of approximately million in revenue in the fourth quarter of and approximately million in revenue for the year ended december  on march  we became aware that the kiev city prosecutor s office had initiated an investigation into the activities of our partners in gtu 
the investigation appeared to concern alleged improprieties in the manner in which gtu routed certain traffic through the state owned monopoly carrier  ukrtelecom 
gtu received a letter dated july  from the general prosecutor of ukraine stating that effective july  the prosecutor s office withdrew all charges against gtu due to the absence of grounds on which to prosecute 
on october   the kiev city prosecutor s office notified gtu that the previous decision to close the investigation had been revoked 
in subsequent discussions with the kiev city prosecutor s office  the investigators advised the management of gtu that the prosecutor s office is reviewing internal procedural requirements with the intent to close the investigation again 
in february  the ukrainian parliament overrode the president s veto and adopted changes to existing regulations relating to mobile telecommunication services in ukraine 
the new regulations stipulate the cancellation of end customer charges for incoming calls 
these changes will come into force in six months time  unless superseded by a new law on communications or over ruled by a constitutional court decision 
because we expect that interconnect tariffs for calls from the pstn to mobile networks to be lower than current tariffs that mobile operators charge customers for incoming calls  it is expected that mobile operators will have to increase tariffs for outgoing calls and or set higher monthly fees to compensate for the expected decrease in revenue 
in addition to our traditional voice and data service provision  prior to  we were actively pursuing a strategy of developing non traditional telecom service offerings including those related to the internet  such as web hosting  web design  and vertical and horizontal internet portal development 
in line with experience outside of russia  we did not see the rapid development of internet based services that were expected 
internet based advertising and e commerce revenues did not develop to significant levels and we reviewed our long term strategy for internet based products 
as a result of this review  we evaluated the future cash flows for this business  and we recorded an impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of we expect to see some growth in internet based advertising and will continue to offer this service to support our dial up internet service and be in a position to capitalize on any upturn in demand for this service 
we have seen a significant year over year increase in our dial up internet subscriber numbers and we expect the increase to continue  as our base of regional subscribers expands 
as additional dial up capacity becomes available in moscow  we expect to increase our market share in the capital as well 
in june we completed the purchase of a leading russian internet service provider  cityline  together with uralrelcom  another internet service provider and an infrastructure company  ptk  and together  these entities allowed us to increase our regional dial up internet presence and increase our numbering capacity and access lines in moscow 
the new moscow capacity was initially placed into service in july the moscow numbering capacity and some of the access lines provided by ptk are intended to support incremental clec services division end user customers  with the majority of the access lines being allocated to support planned increases in dial up internet subscribers in our data and internet services division 
we have continued to integrate our acquisitions and improve operational efficiency while at the same time controlling costs 
we expect to incur further costs in connection with overall restructuring of our operations in our equity investee  mct  is in default on a loan note that originally became due on september  in december  mct signed a forbearance agreement whereby the holder of the note agreed to forbear from selling the note or exercising its rights under the original debt agreements and to extend the terms of repayment until january  mct did not make payment on the note prior to january  and during april the holder of the loan note foreclosed on the collateral related to the note and subsequently sold it to a third party  resulting in a substantial loss to mct 
we recorded a write off of an amount corresponding to our equity in mct s losses during the second quarter of the write off did not exceed the carrying value of our investment in mct 
total equity in losses recognized by us related to our mct investment were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we have no further commitments to provide financial support to mct 
recent acquisitions in august  we completed the purchase of the remaining approximately of gtu and now own of gtu and have full operational and management control over the ukrainian operations 
in september  we completed the purchase of the remaining of edn sovintel llc sovintel previously held by open joint stock company rostelecom  bringing our ownership in sovintel to 
the acquisition of the remaining of sovintel will further strengthen our position in the key moscow and st 
petersburg communications markets  position us to realize future operating and cost synergies  and allow us to offer a full suite of telecommunication services across broad geographical markets in russia and the cis 
sovintel provides worldwide communications services  principally to major hotels  business offices and mobile communication companies through its telecommunications network in russia 
critical accounting policies the fundamental objective of financial reporting is to provide useful information that allows a reader to comprehend our business activities 
to assist that understanding  management has identified our critical accounting policies 
these policies have the potential to have a significant impact on our financial statements  either because of the significance of the financial statement item to which they relate  or because they require judgment and estimation due to the uncertainty involved in measuring  at a specific point in time  events which are continuous in nature 
revenue recognition policies  we recognize operating revenues as services are rendered or as products are delivered to customers 
certain revenues  such as connection fees  are deferred in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
in connection with recording revenue  estimates and assumptions are required in determining the expected conversion of the revenue streams to cash collected 
in line with guidance in sab no 
 we also defer direct incremental costs related to connection fees  not exceeding the revenue deferred 
deferred revenues are subsequently recognized over the estimated average customer lives  which are periodically reassessed by us  and such reassessment may impact our future operating results 
allowance for doubtful accounts policies  the allowance estimation process requires management to make assumptions based on historical results  future expectations  the economic and competitive environment  changes in the creditworthiness of our customers  and other relevant factors 
changes in the underlying assumptions may have a significant impact on the results of our operations 
in particular  we have certain amounts due to and from subsidiaries of kpnqwest who are currently subject to bankruptcy proceedings 
the ultimate resolution of this matter will be affected by a number of factors including the determination of legal obligations of each party  the course of the bankruptcy proceedings  and the enforceability of any determinations 
we have recognized provisions based on our preliminary estimate of net exposure in the resolution of these receivables and payables 
if our assessment proves to be incorrect we may have to recognize an additional provision of up to million  net of tax  although management believes that the possibility of such an adverse outcome is remote 
long lived asset recovery policies  this policy is in relation to long lived assets  consisting primarily of property and equipment and intangibles  which comprise a significant portion of our total assets 
changes in technology or changes in our intended use of these assets may cause the estimated period of use or the value of these assets to change 
we perform periodic internal studies to confirm the appropriateness of estimated economic useful lives for each category of current property and equipment 
additionally  long lived assets  including intangibles  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances have indicated that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
estimates and assumptions used in both setting useful lives and testing for recoverability of our long lived assets require the exercise of management s judgment and estimation based on certain assumptions concerning the expected life of any asset and expected future cash flows from the use of an asset 
goodwill and assessment of impairment  commencing from the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on january   we will perform a goodwill impairment testing annually or whenever impairment indicators exist 
this test requires a significant degree of judgment about the future events and it includes determination of the reporting units  allocation of goodwill to the reporting units and comparison of the fair value with the carrying amount of each reporting unit 
based on the discounted cash flow valuations performed in  we concluded that for all reporting units the fair value is in excess of the respective carrying amounts 
valuation allowance for deferred tax asset  we record valuation allowances related to tax effects of deductible temporary differences and loss carryforwards when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that the respective tax assets will not be realized 
changes in our assessment of probability of realization of deferred tax assets may impact our effective income tax rate 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 business combinations  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective for fiscal years beginning after december  under the new rules  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with sfas no

fair values of the reporting units were established using the discounted cash flow method 
upon the adoption of sfas no 
 we recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for negative goodwill deferred credit arising on our equity method investments in the amount of million 
the impact of non amortization of goodwill on our net income for the twelve months ended december  was an approximate million increase  or per share of common stock basic 
we also reclassified to other intangible assets approximately million previously classified as goodwill 
amortization expense for goodwill for the twelve months ended december  was million 
amortization expense for intangible assets for the twelve months ended december  was million 
amortization expense for the succeeding five years is expected to be as follows million  million  million  million  and million

 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this statement deals with the costs of closing facilities and removing assets 
sfas no 
requires entities to record the fair value of a legal liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period it is incurred 
this cost is initially capitalized and amortized over the remaining life of the asset 
once the obligation is ultimately settled  any difference between the final cost and the recorded liability is recognized as a gain or loss on disposition 
sfas no 
is effective for years beginning after june  the adoption of sfas no 
will not have an impact on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations

 consolidated financial statements  to eliminate the exception to consolidation for a subsidiary for which control is likely to be temporary 
the provisions of the statement became effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  we adopted this new standard from january  the adoption of the pronouncement did not have an effect on our results of operations or financial position

are applicable to all companies with stock based employee compensation  regardless of whether they account for that compensation using the fair value method of sfas no 
or the intrinsic value method of apb no 
sfas no 
disclosure provisions are effective for years ending after december  we have adopted the amendments to sfas no 
disclosure provisions required under sfas no 
but we will continue to use the intrinsic value method under apb no 
to account for stock based compensation 
as such  the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
we apply the provisions of apb no 
in accounting for our stock options incentive plans 
the effect of applying sfas no 
on the net income loss as reported is not representative of the effects on reported net income loss in future years due to the vesting period of the stock options and the fair value of additional stock options in future years

fin no 
defines the concept of variable interests and requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated into the financial statements of their primary beneficiaries if the variable interest entities do not effectively disperse risks among the parties involved 
fin no 
applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january  it applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june   to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  if it is reasonably possible that an enterprise will consolidate or disclose information about a variable interest entity when fin no 
becomes effective  the enterprise must disclose information about those entities in all financial statements issued after january  the interpretation may be applied prospectively with a cumulative effect adjustment as of the date on which it is first applied or by restating previously issued financial statements for one or more years  with a cumulative effect adjustment as of the beginning of the first year restated 
we do not expect that the adoption of the provisions of fin no 
will have a material impact on our future results of operations  financial position or cash flow 
results of operations gti is a leading facilities based provider of integrated telecommunications and internet services to businesses and other high usage customers and telecommunications operators in moscow  kiev  st 
petersburg  nizhny novgorod and other major population centers throughout russia and other countries of the commonwealth of independent states 
the results of our four business groups from the operations of both our consolidated entities combined with the non consolidated entities where we are actively involved in the day to day management  are shown in footnote segment information line of business data to our consolidated financial statements 
our functional currency is the us dollar  as the majority of our cash flows are indexed to  or denominated in us dollars 
through december   russia has been considered to be a highly inflationary environment 
from january   russia will cease to be considered as a highly inflationary economy 
as we currently believe our functional currency is the us dollar  we do not expect this change to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
the discussion of our results of operations is organized as follows o consolidated results 
consolidated results of operations for the year ended december  compared to the consolidated results of operations for the year ended december  o consolidated financial position 
consolidated financial position at december  compared to consolidated significant financial position accounts at december  o consolidated results 
consolidated results of operations for the year ended december  compared to the consolidated results of operations for the year ended december  consolidated results consolidated results of operations for the year ended december  compared to the consolidated results of operations for the year ended december  revenue our revenue increased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the breakdown of revenue by business group was as follows consolidated revenue consolidated revenue for the year for the year ended december  ended december  in millions revenue clec services data and internet services long distance services mobile services eliminations total revenue clec services 
revenue from clec services increased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the clec services division of teleross revenue increased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this is mainly due to increases in monthly recurring charges and traffic revenue due to an increase in numbering capacity in active service  partly offset by pricing concessions made to its largest customer and a decrease in equipment sales 
the clec services division of golden telecom bts revenue decreased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease in revenue was due to the suspension of the termination of certain incoming traffic from the beginning of the fourth quarter of that continued throughout  partly offset by an increase in other recurring revenues 
for ads  acquired in september  revenue from clec services was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the acquisition of the remaining ownership interest in sovintel was completed in the third quarter of we began consolidating sovintel into our results of operations from september  as a result of consolidating sovintel  revenue from clec services increased by million for the year ended december  sovintel s revenue increased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  increases in traffic volumes  particularly incoming international traffic  more than offset reductions in tariffs 
also  increases in recurring fees  equipment sales and other service offerings contributed to the increase 
data and internet services 
revenue from data and internet services increased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase is largely the result of increases in internet revenue from both dial up and dedicated internet subscribers  increases in internet traffic and other internet related revenues 
our dial up internet subscribers grew from  at december  to  at december  internet revenues have increased by the acquisition of cityline and uralrelcom on june   however  cityline s subscribers were absorbed into teleross operations during so we are not able to identify the incremental impact of this acquisition on the year ended december  uralrelcom s revenue was million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  long distance services 
revenue from long distance services increased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase is largely the result of increases in recurring fees and traffic revenues due to an increasing end user customer base in moscow and in many russian regions  which more that offset tariff reductions 
the increase is partly offset by a decline in equipment sales in the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   due to a large contract that was installed in the first half of mobile services 
revenue from mobile services decreased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  active subscribers declined approximately and the average revenue per subscriber has declined by to approximately per month

the acquisition of the remaining ownership interest in sovintel was completed in the third quarter of we began consolidating sovintel into our results of operations from september  as a result of consolidating sovintel  cost of revenue from clec services increased by million for the year ended december  sovintel s cost of revenue increased by to million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  from million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  the increase in cost of revenue of is primarily a result of increases in operator settlements as a result of increases in traffic related revenue 
data and internet services 
cost of revenue from data and internet services increased by to million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  from million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  the decrease as a percentage of revenue was mainly due to the operational improvements in terms of efficient use of available network resources 
long distance services 
cost of revenue from long distance services remained unchanged at million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  and was of revenue  for the year ended december  the improvement in cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue is partly due to an increase in end users in the long distance traffic mix and the decrease in lower margin equipment sales partly offset by additional satellite transponder costs and higher settlement costs to other operators 
mobile services 
cost of revenue from mobile services decreased by to million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  from million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  the cost of revenue decreased as a percentage of revenue  mainly as a result of cost controls and a change in the revenue mix from handset sales to traffic revenue 
selling  general and administrative our selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by to million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  from million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  this decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses was mainly due to reductions in employee related costs  advertising  and other selling  general and administrative expenses partially offset by increase in revenue related taxes 
the acquisition of the remaining of sovintel and subsequent consolidation contributed million for the year ended december  to selling  general and administrative expenses 
sovintel s selling  general and administrative expenses increased by to million  or of revenue for the year ended december  from million  or of revenue for the year ended december  the increase was largely due to a increases in employee related costs  increases in revenue related taxes  and increases in sales and marketing expenses 
depreciation and amortization our depreciation and amortization expenses decreased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease is in part due to the adoption of sfas no 
which requires that goodwill no longer be amortized effective from january  and which reduced our amortization expense by approximately million for the year ended december  and also as a result of the impairment charges recorded in the fourth quarter of  which in turn reduced the level of depreciation and amortization recorded for the year ended december  by million 
these reductions were  in part  offset by depreciation on continuing capital expenditures of the consolidated entities 
the acquisition of the remaining of sovintel and subsequent consolidation of sovintel as of september  into our results of operations contributed million for the year ended december  to depreciation and amortization 
impairment charge in the fourth quarter of we recorded impairment charges totaling million covering two aspects of our business 
severely reduced expectations in demand for internet advertising in russia  as throughout western markets  had impacted the value of our internet portal assets and as a result we recorded an impairment charge of million 
operating difficulties had impacted our mobile business in ukraine and as a result we recorded an impairment charge of million 
for further details of these charges  refer to note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
no impairment charge was recorded for the year ended december  equity in earnings of ventures the earnings after interest and tax charges from our investments in non consolidated ventures were million for the year ended december  down from earnings of million for the year ended december  we recognized earnings at sovintel of million for the period from january to september   which more than offset our recognized losses in mct of million 
for the year ended december   our recognized earnings at sovintel were million  which more than offset our recognized losses in mct 
interest income our interest income was million for the year ended december  down from million for the year ended december  the decrease in interest income mainly reflects lower interest rates earned on our cash and cash equivalents 
interest expense our interest expense was million for the year ended december  down from million for the year ended december  interest expense mainly reflects the effect of higher average balances of debt  including capital leases offset by lower interest rates 
debt  excluding capital lease obligations  at december  was million  of this million was added in december  compared to million at december  foreign currency loss our foreign currency loss was million for the year ended december   compared to a million loss for the year ended december  the increase in foreign currency loss is due to a combination of movements in exchange rates and changes in the amount of net monetary assets that we have denominated in foreign currencies 
the acquisition of the remaining of sovintel and subsequent consolidation of sovintel from september  into our results of operations contributed million for the year ended december  to foreign currency losses 
provision for income taxes our charge for income taxes was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the acquisition of the remaining of sovintel and subsequent consolidation of sovintel from september  into our results of operations contributed million for the year ended december  to income taxes

in the year ended december   our recognized earnings at sovintel were million  which were more than offset by our recognized losses of million from our russian mobile ventures 
interest income our interest income was million for the year ended december  down from million for the year ended december  the decrease in interest income mainly reflects the reduced balance of cash  cash equivalents and investments available for sale following the use of a significant part of the proceeds from our ipo for acquisitions and capital expenditure and the reduction in interest rates during interest expense our interest expense was million for the year ended december  down from million for the year ended december  the decrease in interest expense reflects the reduced level of debt in the company 
foreign currency loss our foreign currency loss was million for the year ended december   compared to a million loss for the year ended december  the increased loss  in part reflects the increased devaluation of the ruble  as compared to the dollar  in the year ended december  provision for income taxes our charge for income taxes was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the overall increase in the provision for income taxes was due to the increase in tax incurred at golden telecom ukraine  as its brought forward tax losses had been fully utilized  and the increasing profitability at teleross operating company

our net loss per share of common stock was in the year ended december   compared to in the year ended december  the increase in loss per share of common stock was due to the increase in net loss and a decrease in the number of weighted average shares to  in the year ended december   compared to  in the year ended december  the decrease in weighted average shares largely resulted from a buy back of  shares of our common stock in july  income taxes our effective rate of income tax differs from the us statutory rate due to the impact of the following factors different income tax rates and regulations apply in the countries where we operate  amortization of goodwill and certain acquired intangible assets is not deductible for income tax purposes  and in the year ended december  we recorded a million impairment charge that was not deductible for income tax purposes 
we have not recorded a tax benefit in relation to our us net operating loss carry forward amount as our taxable us income is largely comprised of interest income and dividends which we do not expect to continue over the longer term 
prior to we have not recognized a tax benefit in relation to the deferred tax assets of our russian and ukrainian entities due to uncertainty over the application and future development of the tax regimes in the two countries 
however  in and  as a result of our russian and ukrainian subsidiaries profitability for russian and ukrainian statutory purposes and reasonable certainty of future profits  we recorded deferred tax asset in the appropriate russian and ukrainian subsidiaries 
in respect of the impairment charge  this created additional deferred tax assets  against which we recorded valuation allowances as a result of the uncertainties concerning future realization of the tax assets

the lease required full prepayments as the capacity increased from an stm to an stm to full capacity of stm full prepayments were made to the lessor in april  august and february these prepayments have been offset against the lease obligation in the financial statements of the company 
we will continue to make payments for maintenance for the term of the lease

after this sale  gts continued to own approximately million shares  or approximately percent  of our outstanding common stock 
to effect the buy back  we acted as designated purchaser and exercised the options held by alfa group alfa  capital international global emerging markets private equity fund lp capital  and investment funds managed by barings vostok capital partners baring vostok to acquire our common stock for per share from gts 
alfa  capital  and baring vostok acquired these options in conjunction with their acquisition of million in our common shares from gts in may in october  gts sold the remaining approximately million shares of our common stock and is no longer a stockholder in gti

under this facility  we provide full cash collateral  held in london  and recorded on our balance sheet as restricted cash  for onshore loans made by the bank to our russian registered joint ventures 
in a second  similar facility  we provide full cash collateral for a short term back to back  revolving  credit facility for up to million from the same bank for two of our larger russian operating companies 
the funding level as of december  for all these facilities totaled million  of which million was funded to our consolidated subsidiaries and million was funded to our non consolidated entities 
in order for us to compete successfully  we may require substantial capital to continue to develop our networks and meet the funding requirements of our operations and ventures  including possible losses from operations 
we may also require capital for our acquisition and business development initiatives 
the net proceeds from our ipo and our private placement have been applied to these funding requirements 
we also expect to fund these requirements through our cash flow from operations  proceeds from additional equity and debt offerings that we may conduct  and debt financing facilities 
in september  teleross llc teleross  a wholly owned russian subsidiary  issued a three month million non interest bearing note payable to rostelecom in partial settlement for the acquisition of the remaining ownership interest in sovintel previously held by rostelecom

in the ordinary course of business  we may enter into arrangements with operators and vendors principally for access to telecommunication network and equipment 
in september  we entered into a purchase commitment for satellite transmission capacity 
the agreement requires monthly payments of million each 
in the future  we may execute especially large or numerous acquisitions  which may require us to raise additional funds through a dilutive equity issuance  through additional borrowings with collateralization and through the divestment of non core assets  or combinations of the above 
in the case especially large or numerous acquisitions do not materialize  we expect our current sources of funding to finance our capital requirements for the next to months 
the actual amount and timing of our future capital requirements may differ materially from our current estimates because of changes or fluctuations in our anticipated acquisitions  investments  revenue  operating costs and network expansion plans and access to alternative sources of financing on favorable terms 
further  in order for us to compete successfully  we may require substantial capital to continue to develop our networks and meet the funding requirements of our operations and ventures  including losses from operations 
we will also require capital for other acquisition and business development initiatives 
we expect to fund these requirements through our cash on hand  cash flow from operations  proceeds from additional equity and debt offerings that we may conduct  and debt financing facilities 
we may not be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms 
as a result  we may be subject to additional or more restrictive financial covenants  our interest obligations may increase significantly and our shareholders may be adversely diluted 
our failure to generate sufficient funds in the future  whether from operations or by raising additional debt or equity capital  may require us to delay or abandon some or all of our anticipated expenditures  to sell assets  or both  which could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
as part of our drive to increase our network capacity  reduce costs and improve the quality of our service  we have leased additional fiber optic and satellite based network capacity  the terms of these leases are generally five years or more and can involve significant advance payments 
as demand for our telecommunication services increases we expect to enter into additional capacity agreements and may make significant financial commitments  in addition to our existing commitments 
as of december   we had the following contractual obligations  including short and long term debt arrangements commitments for future payments under non cancelable lease arrangements and purchase obligations payments due by period less than total year years years thereafter short and long term debt    capital lease obligations    non cancelable lease obligations    purchase obligations    total contractual cash obligations     item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk and treasury and currency exposure management our treasury function has managed our funding  liquidity and exposure to interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risks 
our investment treasury operations are conducted within guidelines that have been established and authorized by our audit committee 
in accordance with our policy  we do not enter into any treasury management transactions of a speculative nature 
the ruble and the hryvna are generally non convertible outside russia and ukraine  respectively  so our ability to hedge against further devaluation by converting to other currencies is significantly limited 
further  our ability to convert rubles and hryvna into other currencies in russia and ukraine  respectively  is subject to rules that restrict the purposes for which conversion and the payment of foreign currencies are allowed 
given that much of our operating costs are indexed to or denominated in us dollars  including employee compensation expense  capital expenditure and interest expense  we have taken specific steps to minimize our exposure to fluctuations in the appropriate foreign currency 
although local currency control regulations require us to collect virtually all of our revenue in local currency  certain ventures generally either price or invoice in us dollars or index their invoices and collections to the applicable dollar exchange rate 
customer contracts may include clauses allowing additional invoicing if the applicable exchange rate changes significantly between the invoice date and the date of payment  favorable terms for early or pre payments and heavy penalty clauses for overdue payments 
maintaining the dollar value of our revenue subjects us to additional tax on exchange gains 
although we are attempting to match revenue  costs  borrowing and repayments in terms of their respective currencies  we may experience economic loss and a negative impact on earnings as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
our cash and cash equivalents are held largely in interest bearing accounts  in us dollars  however we do have bank accounts denominated in russian rubles and ukrainian hryvna

cash in excess of our immediate operating needs is invested in us money market instruments 
in accordance with our investment policy  we maintain a diversified portfolio of low risk  fully liquid securities 
our investments available for sale were none and million as of december  and  respectively  stated at fair value 
we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on our obligations and we also face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
we have developed risk management policies that establish guidelines for managing foreign currency exchange rate risk and we also periodically evaluate the materiality of foreign currency exchange exposures and the financial instruments available to mitigate this exposure
