includes million of long term debt that is included in other long term liabilities at december  and ebitda is defined as operating income excluding depreciation and amortization 
we believe ebitda to be relevant and useful information as ebitda is the primary measure used by our management to measure the operating profits or losses of our business 
ebitda is one of several metrics used by our management to measure the cash generated from our operations  excluding the operating cash requirements of our interest and income taxes

introduction we are the second largest wireless communications service provider in the united states based on revenues for our goal is to be the premier provider of high quality wireless voice and data communication services to businesses and consumers in major markets of north america 
we seek to expand 
table of contents our customer base and revenue stream by providing high quality  innovative wireless voice and data services 
as of december   we had million consolidated subscribers 
for the year ended december   we had billion of total consolidated revenues 
we currently provide wireless voice and data services over two separate  overlapping networks 
one network uses time division multiple access  or tdma  as its signal transmission technology 
tdma is often referred to as a second generation  or g  technology 
as of december   it covered an aggregate population  which we refer to as pops  of approximately million  or percent of the us population 
we also provide voice and enhanced data services over a separate network that uses the signal transmission technology known as global system for mobile communications  or gsm  and general packet radio service  or gprs 
gsm gprs is often referred to as a two and one half generation  or g  technology 
as of december   this network covered approximately million pops  or percent of the us population 
as of december   our two networks covered an aggregate of approximately million pops  or percent of the us population  and operated in of the largest us metropolitan areas 
we refer to this area as our coverage footprint 
we also provide voice service on our analog network  as mandated by the federal communications commission fcc  and data service over a network utilizing packet switched data technology  or cdpd  which we are phasing out in connection with our launch of gsm gprs service 
we supplement our own networks with roaming agreements that allow our subscribers to use other providers wireless services in regions where we do not have network coverage 
with these roaming agreements  as of december   we were able to offer our tdma customers wireless services covering virtually the entire united states population and gsm gprs service covering approximately percent of the us population 
we refer to this as our service area 
we plan to continue to expand our coverage and service area and increase the capacity and quality of our gsm gprs networks through new network construction  acquisitions  affiliations  joint ventures  and roaming arrangements with other wireless providers 
overview during we continued to make significant strides in executing on our strategy to become the leading provider of mobile voice and data in the major markets of north america 
our achievements in included expanding our gsm gprs network to cover markets  including los angeles  new york  and san francisco  thereby increasing gsm gprs network coverage from approximately million pops as of the prior year end to approximately million pops as of december   at a cost of only per pop  completing the acquisition of telecorp pcs  inc  thereby further expanding our coverage footprint see telecorp pcs  inc acquisition below  growing our subscriber base nearly percent by adding nearly million new subscribers  in addition to the approximately  subscribers we acquired as part of the telecorp acquisition  to increase our total consolidated subscribers to million as of december   lowering our churn rate from percent in to percent in  and increasing our services revenue nearly percent from billion in to billion in  to become the second largest us wireless carrier 
we achieved this growth in a slowing sector and in a soft economy 
subscriber growth for the wireless industry slowed to an estimated percent in from percent in we believe the slower growth rate is due principally to higher penetration rates and a weak economy 
as the industry growth rate has slowed  we have maintained our focus on attracting and retaining high value customers  and on developing products that will allow us to provide new services to our existing customers and to profitably serve that portion of the population that does not currently use wireless services 
if competitive pressures continue to drive down 
table of contents pricing or limit our ability to introduce targeted price increases  our revenue growth  as well as our ebitda defined as our operating income excluding depreciation and amortization growth  will be impacted 
in light of industry conditions  we remain focused on continuing to grow our revenues and growing our ebitda faster than our revenues 
services revenue for grew to a record billion  a percent increase over the prior year 
our average monthly revenue per user  or arpu  was for  which represented a decline of percent from the prior year 
despite the decline for the full year  we improved our arpu to in the fourth quarter of  up from arpu of in the first quarter of but down from in the fourth quarter of to continue to grow our revenues and maintain our arpu  we must continue to grow our subscriber base  increase usage by our subscribers  offer and sell new products and services to our subscribers  introduce revenue enhancement programs  and increase wireless data revenues 
our subscriber growth will be impacted by fluctuations in the industry growth rates 
our subscriber growth will also be impacted by our ability to respond to competitive pricing pressure  and to successfully develop and implement new business models that enable us to profitably address unpenetrated portions of the market 
our focus is on growing profitable revenues  ebitda  and cash flows  and we do not seek to add subscribers that would adversely impact those objectives 
along with adding new subscribers  we continue to focus our efforts on reducing churn and retaining our profitable customers 
controlling churn is important  as the cost of retaining existing subscribers is generally much lower than the cost of acquiring new customers 
our churn rate decreased from percent in to percent in  including the impact to us from worldcom exiting the wireless reseller business 
the improvement to our churn rate during  despite the negative impact to us from worldcom  was largely the result of companywide initiatives  including customer retention programs 
our targeted marketing identifies our profitable customers 
we are increasing the use of national calling plans and encouraging our subscribers to enter into longer term contracts 
during  we increased the percentage of our customers on contracts from approximately percent to percent  and had approximately percent of our customers on two year contracts by year end 
in order to grow our revenues and maintain our arpu  we have and plan to introduce revenue enhancement programs 
additionally  we are particularly focused on increasing revenues from our existing customers  as they provide additional revenue potential without the expenses associated with adding a new subscriber 
in addition to focusing on increasing our revenues  we are working on reducing our cost structure 
reducing our cost structure enhances our ability to make our pricing plans more competitive with wireline service and to encourage further wireline to wireless migration 
during  we entered into international roaming agreements 
as our gsm gprs footprint increases  so will the revenue potential from these roaming arrangements 
additionally  we are increasing the number of our subscribers with international calling capability from their wireless phones 
we will continue to target customer segments and provide products and services that match the needs of those segments 
certain segments respond to pricing plans tailored to their usage patterns while other segments are more attuned to customized service features 
we have been a leader in differentiating our products through our use of targeted pricing plans and the introduction of new products and services 
during the first quarter of  we introduced new and simplified pricing plans 
wireless data continues to be a growth opportunity for us 
all of our gsm gprs phones can access our mmode data service at per bit rates 
during  over one third of our gsm gprs subscribers opted to subscribe to our data plans 
these subscribers generated an average of of revenue per month 
we also have million subscribers with phones that are enabled to access our sms text messaging service 
the 
table of contents approximately million subscribers who used their sms services in generated an average of of revenue in december of in addition to growing revenues  we must reduce costs in order to grow our ebitda faster than our revenues 
our cost reduction efforts are focused on three areas customer acquisition costs  network services  and customer care and information technology costs 
during  our cost per gross subscriber addition  or cpga  increased to  up from in the prior year 
this increase was attributable to higher variable costs including our equipment subsidies and sales commission rates  the inclusion of telecorp s acquisition costs  which has a higher cost structure  worldcom s exit from the wireless reseller business  which eliminated our lowest cost acquisition channel  and higher fixed costs  including our employee and retail store related costs 
telecorp has subsequently been integrated into our sales structure  which will reduce our customer acquisition costs going forward 
additionally  we continue to shift subscriber additions away from higher cost indirect channels to lower cost direct channels  such as our retail stores and direct marketing programs 
our ability to control or reduce our cpga could be adversely affected if our subscriber growth rate slows further  we increase our sales and marketing expenses to support subscriber growth  or we are unable to reduce other costs 
our costs to serve and maintain our existing subscriber base  as measured by our cash cost per user  or ccpu  for declined to  or percent below our prior year ccpu 
the improvement in our ccpu during was largely driven by lower per subscriber roaming expenses and lower provisions for uncollectible receivables 
our ccpu was negatively impacted during by higher minutes of usage per subscriber  which was partially offset by a decrease in our unit cost per minute 
network service costs were affected in by the launch and expansion of our gsm gprs markets and from the acquisition of telecorp 
we incur significant costs in connection with a market launch and service introduction that we do not incur in our mature markets 
we expect that these costs will decrease as our gsm gprs footprint becomes established 
although our roaming expenses have declined significantly as a percentage of our services revenue  they continue to be higher than the industry average 
our roaming expenses as a percentage of our services revenue for the years ended december    and were percent  percent  and percent  respectively 
we are focused on continuing to reduce our roaming expenses 
we will seek to reduce other elements of our cost structure  including our customer care and information technology costs 
we installed new customer care and infrastructure support systems in conjunction with the expansion of our gsm gprs network 
initially  this will increase our costs  as we operate these systems in tandem with our tdma support systems 
over time as we migrate our tdma customers onto these newer systems  our customer care and billing costs should decline 
continued ebitda and revenue growth requires additional capital investment 
our capital expenditures of billion in  excluding internal use software  were devoted principally to constructing our gsm gprs network and enhancing the quality of our tdma network 
we also invested capital in our direct distribution channel by adding retail stores and installing new customer care and support systems for our gsm gprs sales operation 
we expect capital spending to decrease significantly in and beyond  falling from percent and percent of services revenue in and  respectively  to approximately percent of services revenue in we have completed the most capital intensive portion of our gsm gprs expansion  deploying the network over approximately million pops in our core footprint 
in we will be launching gsm gprs in the telecorp markets  installing edge  expanding our gsm gprs footprint  and adding capacity to our gsm gprs network as demand dictates 
the bulk of our g build out requirements are behind us  and we believe we will be able to maintain this reduced level of capital spending 

table of contents background on october   at t announced a restructuring plan  stating its intention to create a separate company for its wireless services businesses  named at t wireless services  inc we call this restructuring the split off 
at t wireless services includes substantially the same assets and liabilities that were represented by at t wireless group tracking stock 
at t wireless group tracking stock was a class of at t common stock that was intended to provide holders with financial returns based on the financial performance and economic value of at t s wireless services businesses 
on july   at t converted all shares of at t wireless group tracking stock into shares of at t wireless services common stock on a one for one basis 
in addition  at t completed a distribution of approximately billion shares of at t wireless services common stock to at t shareholders in the form of a stock dividend 
these transactions effected the split off of at t wireless services from at t and resulted in at t wireless services becoming an independent  publicly traded company 
investments  acquisitions  and divestitures docomo investment in january  ntt docomo  inc docomo  a leading japanese wireless communications company  invested billion in a security of at t that  like at t wireless group tracking stock  was intended to reflect a portion of the financial performance and economic value of at t wireless group 
we were allocated billion of the net proceeds from at t 
at t retained the remaining billion of the docomo investment proceeds as consideration for the reduction in at t s retained portion of our value 
in conjunction with the split off  docomo s investment was converted into million shares  or approximately percent  of our common stock 
as part of this investment  we entered into a strategic alliance with docomo to develop mobile multimedia services on a global standard  high speed wireless network 
docomo may require the repurchase of its investment at docomo s original purchase price  plus interest  if we fail to meet specified technological milestones  under certain circumstances 
see capital requirements contractual obligations below for a description of these milestones  which were amended in december see telecorp pcs  inc acquisition below for an additional investment made by docomo during telecorp pcs  inc acquisition on february   we acquired the percent of telecorp pcs  inc telecorp that we did not already own by issuing million at t wireless services common shares and assuming a fair value of billion in net debt and million in preferred securities 
telecorp provided wireless voice services in portions of the midwestern and southeastern united states  which complemented our footprint of licenses and service territory in the united states 
as a result of this transaction  we added markets in states and puerto rico  with approximately  consolidated subscribers as of the acquisition date 
our consolidated subscriber numbers as of the acquisition date did not reflect all telecorp subscribers acquired 
upon consummation of the telecorp acquisition  we established a  subscriber reserve  reflecting anticipated subscriber losses resulting from changes in credit policies  service offerings  billing systems  and rate plans  similar to losses we have previously experienced when integrating subscribers of an acquired entity into our systems 
a portion of the telecorp subscriber reserve had been utilized as of december  we expect our telecorp subscribers to be fully integrated into our systems by mid  at which time we anticipate the remaining subscriber reserve will be utilized 
simultaneously with the transaction closing  docomo purchased million shares of at t wireless services common shares directly from us  exercising its right to maintain an approximate percent equity interest in us 
the price per share paid by docomo was  which was the average price of at t wireless services common shares over the trading days immediately preceding their election to purchase the shares 
we received million in cash for the additional shares issued to docomo 

table of contents other strategic acquisitions on december   we completed the acquisition of a wireless system in houston  which covered a population base of approximately five million potential customers and served approximately  subscribers as of the acquisition date 
also on december   our equity interest in ab cellular  an entity that owned cellular properties in los angeles  houston  and galveston  texas  was redeemed 
in consideration for our equity interest  we received percent of the net assets of the los angeles property 
the los angeles property covered a population base of approximately million potential customers and served approximately million subscribers as of december  on november   we completed a transaction with our affiliate telecorp that resulted in our acquisition of wireless systems in several new england markets 
on october   we completed the acquisition of a wireless system in indianapolis 
combined  the new england and indianapolis markets covered a population base of approximately four million potential customers and served approximately  subscribers as of their acquisition dates 
on september   we completed the acquisition of a wireless system in san diego  which covered a population base of three million potential customers 
also  during the third quarter of  we completed the acquisition of a wireless system on the big island of hawaii 
combined  these two markets served more than  subscribers as of their acquisition dates 
in june  we completed the acquisition of the remaining percent partnership interest we previously did not own in cmt partners bay area properties 
the bay area properties covered a population base exceeding seven million potential customers and  as of the acquisition date  served nearly one million subscribers 
also in june  we completed the acquisition of wireless one network  lp wireless one 
wireless one owned and operated wireless systems in northwest and southwest florida covering a population base of million potential customers and served approximately  subscribers as of its acquisition date 
in february  at t and dobson  through a joint venture  acquired american cellular corporation acc 
at t contributed its interest in the joint venture to us as of the date of the acquisition 
this acquisition increased our coverage through our affiliates in new york state and several midwest markets 
exit of fixed wireless business in december  we finalized plans and received approval from our board of directors to exit the fixed wireless business 
this decision resulted in a pretax charge of billion during the fourth quarter of  reflecting a write down of assets and the impact of phased exit charges 
during the first quarter of  we completed the sale of certain fixed wireless assets to netro corporation netro  a company that is engaged in a business substantially different from our fixed wireless business 
netro paid million in cash and issued million shares of netro common stock to acquire a license to intellectual property  equipment  and proprietary software assets 
during the second half of  we sold a portion of our shares of netro common stock  which reduced our ownership percentage of netro s outstanding common stock to approximately percent as of december  during the first  second  and third quarters of  we recorded aftertax gains on disposal of the fixed wireless business totaling million  million  and million  respectively 
the gains consisted of adjustments to the recoverability of assets and accruals associated with exit costs from the fixed wireless business 
we completed the disposal of the fixed wireless business during critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported 
we base our estimates on historical experience  where applicable  and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents there are certain critical estimates that we believe require significant judgment in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires us to make assumptions because information was not available at the time or it included matters that were highly uncertain at the time we were making the estimate  and changes in the estimate or different estimates that we could have selected would have had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
the table below presents information about the nature of and rationale for our critical accounting estimates financial statement caption critical estimate item nature of estimates assumptions approach impact if different services revenue unbilled services revenue our billing cycle cut off times require us to estimate a significant amount of services revenue earned but not yet billed at the end of each quarter 
we estimate our unbilled services revenue by reviewing historical minutes of use processed  adjusted for differences in the types and number of days  seasonality factors  and customer levels 
actual services revenue could be greater or lower than amounts estimated due to customer levels and their usage differing from our adjusted historical experience 
adjustments are made in the following quarter for the differences between the actual services revenue billed and the previously accrued amounts 
historically  our adjustments have not been material 
accounts receivable  net allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our estimate of losses resulting from the failure or inability of our customers to make required payments 
we estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts by applying estimated loss percentages against our aging of accounts receivable balances 
the estimated loss percentages are updated periodically and are based on our historical write off experience  net of recoveries 
changes to allowances may be required if the financial condition of our customers improves or deteriorates or if we adjust our credit standards for new customers  thereby resulting in write off patterns that differ from historical experience 
historically  changes to our estimated loss percentages have not been material 

table of contents financial statement caption critical estimate item nature of estimates assumptions approach impact if different property  plant  and equipment  net useful lives of wireless communications equipment  buildings and improvements  and internal use software we estimate useful lives when recording depreciation and amortization expense associated with our wireless communications equipment  buildings and improvements  and internal use software 
we periodically evaluate our useful lives considering factors such as changes in our technology and industry to confirm that they continue to be appropriate 
the actual economic lives may be different than our estimated useful lives  thereby resulting in different carrying values of our property  plant  and equipment 
these evaluations could result in a change in our depreciable lives and therefore our depreciation expense in future periods 
historically  we have changed our estimated useful lives due to changes in technology see note to our consolidated financial statements 
property  plant  and equipment  net impairments of property  plant  and equipment in accordance with sfas no 
 we review our property  plant  and equipment for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
impairment reviews require a comparison of the estimated future undiscounted cash flows to the carrying value of the asset 
if the total of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value  an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the asset 
significant assumptions required in determining the undiscounted cash flows of our property  plant  and equipment include the group of assets subject to the impairment  cash flows attributed to the group of assets  future cash flows of the group of assets  time period for which the assets will be held and used  and salvage value for the assets 
significant assumptions required in determining the fair value of our property  plant  and equipment are similar to those estimates required in determining the undiscounted cash flows  with the addition of an estimated discount rate to incorporate the time value of money and the risks inherent in the future cash flows 
the use of different estimates or assumptions within our undiscounted cash flow model could result in undiscounted cash flows lower than the current carrying value of our assets  thereby requiring the need to compare the carrying values to their fair values 
the use of different estimates or assumptions when determining the fair value of our property  plant  and equipment may result in different values for our property  plant  and equipment  and any related impairment charges 
additionally  a different method of determining fair value  other than by using a discounted cash flow model  could result in a lower or higher fair value of our property  plant  and equipment 

table of contents financial statement caption critical estimate item nature of estimates assumptions approach impact if different goodwill impairment of goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 we complete an impairment test of goodwill annually  or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our business enterprise below its carrying value 
the impairment test requires us to estimate the fair value of our overall business enterprise  which is done primarily using a discounted cash flow model rather than the market price of our stock 
we determined that we have one reporting unit for purposes of testing goodwill  and therefore  the discounted cash flow model is largely a function of the cash flows of the enterprise 
significant estimates required in our discounted cash flow model include future cash flows of our primary assets  our weighted average cost of capital  long term rate of growth for our business  amount and timing for utilization of federal income tax net operating loss carryforwards  and estimated fair values of our interest bearing debt and assets not contributing to the discounted cash flows of our primary assets 
the use of different estimates or assumptions within our discounted cash flow model when determining the fair value of our business enterprise may result in different values for our goodwill  and any related impairment charge 
if market prices adjusted for items that may affect the fair value of the reporting unit  such as a control premium were used to derive the fair value of our business enterprise instead of a discounted cash flow model  it could result in a lower fair value of our business enterprise 
licensing costs impairment of licensing costs in accordance with sfas no 
 we complete an impairment test of our licensing costs annually  or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our federal communications commission fcc licenses below their carrying value 
the impairment test requires us to estimate the fair value of our licensing costs 
we estimate the fair value of a majority of our fcc licenses in the aggregate  using a discounted cash flow model 
we evaluate the fair value of our non strategic licenses separately  primarily using comparative market transaction data 
significant estimates required in our discounted cash flow model include start up model assumption with fcc licenses as the only asset owned  future cash flows related to fcc licenses  weighted average cost of capital for a start up asset  and long term rate of growth for our business 
the fair value of our non strategic licenses is determined by obtaining market data on recent fcc license transactions eg  purchases  sales  or swaps and deriving estimates of the fair value for each license based on certain characteristics of the license and related market  including megahertz frequency  market size  geographic location  and population density 
the use of different estimates or assumptions within our discounted cash flow model when determining the fair value of our licensing costs may result in different values for our licensing costs  and any related impairment charge 
actual market prices for our fcc licenses could differ from those derived in our analysis resulting in different values for our non strategic licensing costs  and any related impairment charge 
additionally  different methods of determining fair value  other than by using discounted cash flow models and market data  could result in lower or higher fair values of our licensing costs

these impairment reviews occur at least annually  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable  and require us to estimate the fair value of our investments in and advances to unconsolidated subsidiaries 
in the event that the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value  we are required to determine whether this decline in fair value is other than temporary 
to estimate the fair value of our investments in and advances to unconsolidated subsidiaries  we use discounted cash flow modeling as well as other available evidence including  but not limited to  quoted market prices  market comparables  and industry multiples 
to determine whether the decline in fair value below our carrying value is other than temporary  we evaluate  among other factors  the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than carrying value  the financial health of and business outlook for the investee  including industry and sector performance  changes in technology and operational and financing cash flows factors  and our intent and ability to hold the investment 
the use of different methods of determining the fair value of our investments in and advances to unconsolidated subsidiaries could result in different values for our investments in and advances to our unconsolidated subsidiaries  and any related impairment charges 
business tax accruals  deferred income taxes  and other current liabilities legal and tax contingencies we record reserves to address potential exposures related to business and income tax positions we have taken that have been or could be challenged by taxing authorities 
additionally  we record reserves associated with legal proceedings and lawsuits for which the likelihood of payment is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated 
the determination for required reserves is based upon analysis of each individual tax issue or legal proceeding  taking into consideration the likelihood of adverse judgments and the range of possible loss 
additionally  our analysis may include discussion with outside legal counsel 
the ultimate resolution of these potential exposures and legal proceedings may be greater or less than the amounts reserved

does not consider the realization of our deferred tax assets to be more likely than not 
due to the adoption of sfas no 
on january   we may not rely on the reversal of deferred tax liabilities associated with licensing costs and goodwill as a means to realize our deferred tax assets  which primarily represent tax net operating losses 
additionally  due to our lack of earnings history as an independent company and impairment charges recognized on our licensing costs and unconsolidated subsidiaries  we cannot rely on forecasts of future earnings as a means to realize our deferred tax assets

established new standards related to how acquired goodwill and other intangible assets are to be recorded upon their acquisition  as well as how they are to be accounted for after they have been initially recognized in the financial statements 
effective with the adoption of this standard  we are no longer amortizing acquired goodwill and excess net book value associated with our equity method unconsolidated subsidiaries 
additionally  we were required to reassess the useful lives of our other intangible assets  which consist primarily of fcc licensing costs and customer lists 
although fcc licenses are issued with a stated term  generally years  the renewal of fcc licenses is a routine matter involving a nominal fee and we have determined that no legal  regulatory  contractual  competitive  economic  or other factors currently exist that limit the useful life of our fcc licenses 
as such  effective with the adoption of sfas no 
 we are no longer amortizing licensing costs of us consolidated subsidiaries as these licensing costs are deemed to be intangible assets that have indefinite lives 
prospectively  we will continue to periodically re evaluate our determination of an indefinite useful life with regard to fcc licenses 
our unconsolidated subsidiaries completed a similar assessment for licensing costs 
our us and canadian unconsolidated subsidiaries also determined that their licensing costs have indefinite lives and ceased amortization of those costs 
we also re assessed the useful life of our customer lists and determined that a five year life continues to be appropriate 
upon adoption  sfas no 
required a transitional impairment test using a fair value approach for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives 
goodwill is to be evaluated for impairment using a two step test 
the first step consists of a review for potential impairment  while the second 
table of contents step  if required  calculates the amount of impairment  if any 
upon adoption of this standard  we completed a transitional impairment test for our acquired goodwill  determining fair value using primarily a discounted cash flow model 
we determined that we had one reporting unit for purposes of testing goodwill  and therefore  the discounted cash flow model was largely a function of the cash flows of the enterprise 
the determined fair value of the transitional impairment test was sufficient to pass the first step of the impairment test  and therefore  the second step was not performed and no impairment was recorded 
the premise of the discounted cash flow model was based upon our internal plans related to the future cash flows of our primary assets 
the model assumed no step up in basis of the assets and depreciation was carried over at current levels 
in order to assess our fair value in its entirety  following the calculation of the discounted cash flows of our primary assets  the fair value of our interest bearing debt was deducted and the fair values of our assets not contributing to the discounted cash flows of our primary assets  primarily our unconsolidated subsidiaries  were added to derive the fair value of our total net assets 
however  this method of determining fair value would not have necessarily equated to the implied fair value that might have been derived from using the market price of our common stock 
we also completed a transitional impairment test for us licensing costs  calculating fair value using primarily a discounted cash flow model  and determined that there was no impairment to be recorded 
the discounted cash flow model estimates the required resources and eventual returns from the build out of an operational network and acquisitions of customers  starting with only fcc licenses 
in this manner  the cash flows are isolated as specifically pertaining to the fcc licenses 
a majority of the us licensing costs were tested for impairment on an aggregate basis  which is consistent with our management of the business and national scope of operations 
during the first quarter of  we recorded a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of million  net of tax  associated with our portion of transitional impairment charges recognized by our equity method unconsolidated subsidiaries upon adoption of sfas no 
of the total aftertax charge  million and million represented our proportionate share of impairments recognized by telecorp of its us licensing costs and goodwill  respectively 
the remaining million represented our proportionate share of an impairment of licensing costs recognized by acc 
see impairment charges below for additional impairment charges recognized by our equity method unconsolidated subsidiaries  subsequent to adoption 
at december   the carrying values of goodwill and us licensing costs were  million and  million  respectively 
had sfas no 
been applied as of january   and we ceased amortization of our goodwill and us licensing costs  our income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle would have been higher by and per share for the years ended december  and  respectively 
on a prospective basis  we are required to test both acquired goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  consisting of us licensing costs  for impairment on an annual basis based upon a fair value approach 
additionally  goodwill must be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of an entity below its carrying value 
these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate  including a significant sustained decline in an entity s market value  legal factors  operating performance indicators  competition  sale  or disposition of a significant portion of the business  or other factors 
if our market value continues to be less than our book value for an extended period of time  it could trigger the need for impairment tests of acquired goodwill between annual tests 
other indefinite lived intangible assets must be tested between annual tests if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
during the third quarter of  we completed our annual impairment tests for both acquired goodwill and us licensing costs using methodologies consistent with those applied for our transitional impairment tests performed as of january  such testing resulted in no impairment charge to goodwill  as the determined fair value was again sufficient to pass the first step impairment test 
we believe that a discounted cash flow model is the best measure of fair value for our reporting unit 
however  the average trading values of our common stock for the quarters ended march   june   september   and december   were    and  respectively  
table of contents reflecting a market capitalization that is significantly lower than the fair value determined using discounted cash flows 
if market prices were used to derive the fair value of the reporting unit  such values would need to consider other items that may affect the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole  such as a control premium 
if this method was used and we failed to pass the first step of the impairment test  it is reasonably possible that a goodwill impairment would result 
while we do not use our market price to determine the fair value of our reporting unit  we expect convergence between our market capitalization and discounted cash flow valuation to occur over time 
if this does not occur  it may signal the need for impairment charges 
the first annual reassessment of our licensing costs resulted in a total pretax impairment charge of  million 
see impairment charges below for further information regarding these tests 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement replaces sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas no 
retains the fundamental provisions of sfas no 
for recognition and measurement of the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used and for measurement of long lived assets to be disposed of by sale 
this statement applies to all long lived assets  including discontinued operations  and replaces the provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 reporting results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  for the disposal of segments of a business 
this statement requires that those long lived assets be measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell  whether reported in continuing operations or in discontinued operations 
our initial adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position  or cash flows 
results of operations the following discussion describes the financial condition and results of operations of at t wireless services 
this discussion includes the effect of certain other subsidiaries  assets  and liabilities of at t that constituted at t wireless group 
at t contributed to us all of the subsidiaries  assets  and liabilities that constituted at t wireless group 
consistent with our historical financial statements  we have treated these contributions and related transactions in a manner similar to a pooling of interests and we have assumed that these contributions and related transactions were completed in historical periods prior to the split off by the legal entity at t wireless services
