item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a is intended to inform the reader about matters affecting the financial condition and results of operations of aflac incorporated and its subsidiaries for the three year period ended december  as a result  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements and notes 
company overview aflac incorporated is the parent company of american family life assurance company of columbus  aflac 
our principal business is supplemental health and life insurance  which is marketed and administered through aflac 
most of aflac s policies are individually underwritten and marketed at worksites through independent agents  with premiums paid by the employee 
our operations in japan aflac japan and the united states aflac us service the two markets for our insurance business 
critical accounting estimates we prepare our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the estimates discussed below are critical to an understanding of aflac s results of operations and financial condition 
the preparation and evaluation of these critical accounting estimates involves the use of various assumptions developed from management s analysis and judgments 
the application of these critical accounting estimates determines the values at which of our assets and of our liabilities are reported and thus have a direct effect on net earnings and shareholders equity 
subsequent experience or use of other assumptions could result in significantly different results 
investments our investments in debt and equity securities include both publicly traded and privately issued securities 
for privately issued securities  we receive pricing data from external sources that take into account each security s credit quality and liquidity characteristics 
we also routinely review our investments that have experienced declines in fair value to determine if the decline is other than temporary 
these reviews are performed with consideration of the facts and circumstances of an issuer in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 accounting for non current marketable equity securities  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and related guidance 
the identification of potentially impaired investments  the determination of fair value if not publicly traded  and the assessment of whether a decline is other than temporary involve significant management judgment and req uire evaluation of factors including but not limited to exh

deferred policy acquisition costs and policy liabilities aflac products are generally long duration fixed benefit indemnity products 
as such  our products are accounted for under the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises 
we make estimates of certain factors that affect the profitability of our business in order to match expected policy benefits and expenses with expected policy premiums 
these assumptions include persistency  morbidity  mortality  interest rates and expenses 
if actual results mirror the assumptions used in establishing policy liabilities and the deferral and amortization of acquisition costs  profits will emerge as a level percentage of premium revenue 
however  because actual results will vary from the assumptions  the level of profits as a percentage of premium revenue will vary from year to year 
we calculate future policy benefits based on assumptions of morbidity  mortality  persistency and interest established at the time a policy is sold 
generally  changes to these assumptions are not allowed unless it is determined that the policy reserves are not adequate due to actual results varying from original assumptions 
we measure the adequacy of our policy reserves and recoverability of deferred policy acquisition costs dac annually by performing gross premium valuations on our business 
the valuations are performed using a number of different assumption scenarios 
our testing indicates that our insurance liabilities are adequate and that our dac is recoverable 
deferred policy acquisition costs under the requirements of sfas no 
 certain costs of acquiring new business are deferred and amortized over the policy s premium payment period in proportion to anticipated premium income 
future amortization of dac is sensitive to our estimates of persistency  interest and future premium revenue at the time of policy issuance 
however  the unamortized balance of dac reflects the actual persistency to date 
as presented in the following table  the ratio of dac to annualized premium in force has been relatively stable for aflac us and has trended down for aflac japan over the last three years

exh table of contents deferred policy acquisition cost ratios aflac japan aflac us in millions in yen in dollars deferred policy acquisition costs annualized premiums in force deferred policy acquisition costs as a percentage of annualized premiums in force policy liabilities our policy liabilities include two primary components future policy benefits and unpaid policy claims  which account for and of total policy liabilities at december   respectively 
future policy benefits represent our estimate of claims that will occur in the future and are generally calculated as the present value of expected benefits to be paid less the present value of expected net premiums  including for a provision for adverse deviation 
unpaid policy claims include those claims that have occurred and are in the process of payment as well as an estimate of those claims that have occurred but have not yet been reported to us 
assumptions underlying the estimate of the unpaid policy claims are updated annually and incorporate our historical experience as well as other data that provides information regarding our outstanding liability 
due to changes in health care delivery and financing practices in japan  we have experienced a change in the characteristics and timing of our policy benefits 
our review indicated that we have experienced a decline in the average number of hospital days associated with the typical cancer treatment period in japan 
we believe this trend has emerged as a result of the japanese government s effort to curb the medical cost increases under the national health care system 
the government now provides incentives to hospitals to shorten the number of days of confinement per occurrence by providing higher reimbursement rates for shorter hospital stays 
however  our preliminary claims statistics indicated the declines in the average number of days per hospitalization are generally offset by an increase in the average number of hospitalizations required for the treatment of cancer such that the total expected hospital days per claimant has not changed proportionally 
since our unpaid poli cy claims liability primarily includes the unpaid costs associated with a current treatment period  the reduction in the average hospital stay has resulted in a decrease in the average liability for unpaid policy claims 
accordingly  in  we transferred million from unpaid policy claims to the liability for future policy benefits to reflect the anticipated decrease in costs associated with the current treatment period and the associated increase in costs expected in future treatment periods 
these changes had no effect on net earnings

exh table of contents results of operations we evaluate our overall operations using a non gaap financial performance measure called operating earnings and our business segments using pretax operating earnings 
our definition of operating earnings starts with net earnings and excludes the following items on an after tax basis realized investment gains losses  the change in fair value of the interest rate component of cross currency swaps beginning in  the charge for the japanese policyholder protection fund in  and the gain from the termination of a retirement liability in we then exclude income taxes related to operations to arrive at pretax operating earnings 
we believe that the analysis of operating earnings and pretax operating earnings  in addition to net earnings as determined in accordance with gaap  provides information that may enhance an investor s understanding of our underlying profitability and results of operations 
our discussion of earnings and comparisons thereof focuses on pr etax operating earnings and operating earnings 
references to operating earnings per share are based on the diluted number of average outstanding shares  unless stated otherwise 
the difference between the percentage changes in operating earnings and operating earnings per share can be impacted by the share repurchase program  reissued treasury stock  and the dilutive effect of stock options

these impairment losses and other investment transactions in the normal course of business decreased net earnings by million

in  we recognized pretax impairment losses of million 
these impairment losses were primarily related to the corporate debt securities of a us issuer and a european issuer  both of which experienced credit rating downgrades  and our investment in two human resource service companies 
we also realized investment gains in connection with a change in the outside investment manager of a portion of our us equity securities portfolio 
these gains and impairment losses  when included with other investment transactions in the normal course of business  decreased net earnings by million

during  the north american issuers of two debt securities that we owned experienced credit rating downgrades 
we sold one security reported as available for sale at a pretax loss of million and recognized a pretax impairment loss of million on the other security  which was then transferred from held to maturity to available for sale 
these losses and other investment transactions in the normal course of business decreased net earnings by million

our business  in functional currency terms  continued to be strong in  and we believe it is more appropriate to measure our performance excluding the effect of fluctuations in the yen dollar exchange rate in order to understand the basic operating results of the business

based on financial results determined in accordance with fsa requirements for the six months ended september   aflac japan ranked first in profitability among all foreign life insurance companies operating in japan and th in terms of assets among all life insurance companies operating in japan 
aflac japan pretax operating earnings changes in aflac japan s pretax operating earnings and profit margins are affected by investment yields  morbidity  mortality  persistency and expense levels 
continuing favorable claims trends and the shift in our product mix to lower loss ratio products contributed to the decline in the benefit and claims ratios 
we expect the aggregate benefit ratio to continue to decline in future years  along with the shift to newer products and riders 
our persistency has declined only slightly over the last three years 
the operating expense ratio declined in primarily as a result of decreased expenditures for advertising 
operating expense ratios increased in and primarily as a result of increased expenditures for sales promotion  marketing and advertising 
we expect the operating expense ratio to be relatively stable in the future 
the expansion of the profit margins during the past three years was largely attributable to the declining benefit ratio 
our profit margin s are also affected by the spread between investment yields and required interest on policy reserves see table and discussion on page

aflac japan investments growth of investment income in yen is affected by available cash flow from operations  investment yields achievable on new investments  and the effect of yen dollar exchange rates on dollar denominated investment income 
reflecting the continued weakness in japan s economy  investment yields on yen denominated debt securities remained low in however  we were able to achieve a return on average invested assets  net of investment expenses  of in  compared with in and in by focusing on selected sectors of the fixed maturity market 
we purchased yen denominated securities at an average yield of in  compared with in and in including dollar denominated investments  our blended new money yield was in  compared with in and in at december   the yield on aflac japan s fixed maturity portfolio including dollar denominated investments was  compared with in and in aflac japan has invested in privately issued securities to secure higher yields than japanese government or other corporate bonds would have provided  while still adhering to prudent standards for credit quality 
all of our privately issued securities are rated as investment grade at the time of purchase by s p  moody s or the securities valuation office of the national association of insurance commissioners naic 
these securities are generally issued with standard  medium term note documentation and have appropriate covenants 
we continue to believe that we can invest new money in the near term at an adequate spread over policy premium pricing assumptions and assumed interest rates for policy liabilities on new business 
to compensate for lower investment yields  we have increased premium rates for our new business over the last several years  which contributes to the stability of our profit margin 
insurance deregulation in japan in january  japan s insurance market was deregulated  and we experienced an increase in the number of companies selling products that compete with our policies 
however  based on our growth of premiums in force  producing agents and customer accounts  we do not believe that our market position has been significantly impacted by increased competition as a result of deregulation 
furthermore  we believe the continued development and maintenance of operating efficiencies will allow us to offer affordable products at a better value to consumers

in its december monthly report  the bank of japan noted that the economy had stabilized  albeit with substantial uncertainty as to any recovery 
weak private consumption  high unemployment  declining household income and slowing public investment were countered by a slight recovery in corporate profits and improving business sentiment 
as a result  the problems created by excessive employment and debt continue to preclude the momentum needed for a self sustaining recovery  and any recovery is still largely dependent on global conditions 
as we have indicated in years past  japan s weak economy has created a challenging environment for aflac japan  and the time required for an economic recovery remains uncertain

 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
this standard  which is effective for years ending after december   amends the transition and disclosure issues associated with the voluntary adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
we have no plans to adopt the fair value provisions of sfas no 
as a result  the requirements of this standard are not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  effective january  under this standard  derivatives are reported at fair value as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet 
changes in fair value are reported in net earnings or other comprehensive income depending on the derivative instrument and its intended use 
the fair value of derivatives can increase or decrease as exchange rates  interest rates and general economic conditions change 
the adoption of this accounting standard introduced additional volatility into reported net earnings and other comprehensive income  which may continue depending on market conditions and our hedging activities 
however  the changes required by sfas no 
are expected to affect only the reporting of noncash gains and losses 
for additional information  see notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
the disclosure provisions of this interpretation are effective for fiscal years ending after december  the initial recognition and measurement provisions of this interpretation apply to guarantees issued or modified after december   on a prospective basis

exh table of contents analysis of financial condition during the last two years  our financial condition has remained strong in the functional currencies of our operations 
the yen dollar exchange rate at the end of each period is used to translate yen denominated balance sheet items to us dollars for reporting purposes 
the exchange rate at december   was yen to one us dollar  or stronger than the december   exchange rate of 
the stronger yen increased reported investments and cash by billion  total assets by billion  and total liabilities by billion  compared with the amounts that would have been reported for if the exchange rate had remained unchanged from year end see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
market risks of financial instruments our financial instruments are exposed primarily to three types of market risks 
they are currency risk  interest rate risk  and equity price risk 
currency risk the functional currency of aflac japan s insurance operation is the japanese yen 
all of aflac japan s premiums  claims and commissions are received or paid in yen as are most of its investment income and other expenses 
furthermore  most of aflac japan s investments  cash and liabilities are yen denominated 
when yen denominated securities mature or are sold  the proceeds are generally reinvested in yen denominated securities 
aflac japan holds these yen denominated assets to fund its yen denominated policy obligations 
in addition  aflac incorporated has yen denominated notes payable and cross currency swaps related to its senior notes 
although we generally do not convert yen into dollars  we do translate financial statement amounts from yen into dollars for financial reporting purposes 
therefore  the translation of the reported amounts is affected by foreign currency fluctuations 
we report unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income 
on a consolidated basis  we attempt to match yen denominated assets to yen denominated liabilities in order to minimize the exposure of our shareholders equity to foreign currency translation fluctuations 
we accomplish this by investing a portion of aflac japan s investment portfolio in dollar denominated securities see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements and by the parent company s issuance of yen denominated debt see notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
as a result  the effect of currency fluctuations on our net assets is diminished 
at december  consolidated yen denominated net assets were million in and million in aflac japan s yen denominated net assets were billion at december   compared with billion a year ago 
aflac incorporated s yen denominated net liabilities were billion at december   compared with billion a year ago

this primarily occurs when we convert yen funds that have been transferred from aflac japan to aflac us the exchange rates prevailing at the time of transfer may differ from the exchange rates prevailing at the time the yen profits were earned 
it has been our practice to transfer yen funds each year from aflac japan to aflac us generally  these yen fund repatriations have represented an amount less than of aflac japan s prior year fsa based earnings 
typically  a portion of the yen funds transfer is used to service aflac incorporated s yen denominated notes payable and the remainder is converted into dollars

exh table of contents for information regarding the effect of foreign currency translation on operating earnings per share  see foreign currency translation on pages through and note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
interest rate risk our primary interest rate exposure is a result of the effect of changes in interest rates on the fair value of our investments in debt securities 
we use modified duration analysis  which measures price percentage volatility  to estimate the sensitivity of our debt securities fair values to interest rate changes 
for example  if the current duration of a debt security is  then the fair value of that security will increase by approximately if market interest rates decrease by basis points  assuming all other factors remain constant 
likewise  the fair value of the debt security will decrease by approximately if market interest rates increase by basis points  assuming all other factors remain constant

however  we do not expect to realize a majority of these unrealized gains because we have the intent and ability to hold these securities to maturity 
should significant amounts of unrealized losses occur because of increases in market yields  we would not expect to realize significant losses because we have the ability to hold such securities to maturity

exh table of contents we attempt to match the duration of our assets with the duration of our liabilities 
for aflac japan  the duration of policy benefits and related expenses to be paid in future years is longer than that of the related invested assets due to the unavailability of acceptable long duration yen denominated securities 
the average duration of policy benefits and related expenses to be paid in future years was approximately years in both and the average duration of the yen denominated debt securities was approximately years in both and the average duration of premiums to be received in the future was approximately nine years in both and the following table shows a comparison of average assumed interest rates for future policy benefits and investment yields  based on amortized cost  for the years ended december comparison of interest rates for future policy benefits and investment yields net of investment expenses us japan us japan us japan policies issued during year required interest on policy reserves new money yield on investments policies in force during year required interest on policy reserves net investment yield represents yen denominated investments for aflac japan that support policy obligations and therefore excludes aflac japan s dollar denominated investments and related investment income over the next two years  we have several yen denominated securities that mature with yields in excess of aflac japan s current net investment yield of 
these securities total million at amortized cost and have an average yield of 
these maturities will contribute to a continued decline in our overall portfolio yield 
currently  when our debt securities mature  the proceeds may be reinvested at a yield below that of the interest required for the accretion of policy benefit liabilities on policies issued in earlier years 
however  the investment yield on new investments has exceeded interest requirements on policies issued in recent years 
since  premium rates on new business have been increased several times to help offset the lower available investment yields 
also in recent years  our strategy of developing and marketing riders as attachments to our older policies has helped offset the negative investment spread 
and despite the negative investment spreads  adequate overall profit margins still exist in aflac japan s aggregate block of business because of profits that have emerged from changes in mix of business and favorable mortality  morbidity  and expenses 
equity price risk equity securities at december   totaled million  or 
of total investments and cash on a consolidated basis 
we use beta analysis to measure the sensitivity of our equity securities portfolio to fluctuations in the broad market 
the beta of our equity securities portfolio was 
at december  for example  if the overall stock market value changed by  the value of aflac s equity securities would be expected to change by approximately  or million

exh table of contents investments and cash our investment philosophy is to maximize investment income while emphasizing liquidity  safety and quality 
our investment objective  subject to appropriate risk constraints  is to fund policyholder obligations and other liabilities in a manner that enhances shareholders equity 
we seek to meet this objective through a mix of investments that reflects the characteristics of the liabilities they support and diversification of investments by interest rate  currency  liquidity  credit and equity price risk

our investments in yen denominated privately issued securities consist primarily of non japanese issuers  which helps reduce our exposure to japanese corporate issuers 
these non japanese issuers are willing to issue yen denominated securi ties with longer maturities  thereby allowing us to improve our asset and liability matching and our overall investment returns

exh table of contents we continue to adhere to prudent standards for credit quality 
most of our privately issued securities are issued under medium term note programs and have standard covenants commensurate with credit ratings  except when internal credit analysis indicates that additional protective and or event risk covenants are required 
aflac invests primarily within the debt securities markets  which exposes us to credit risk 
credit risk is a consequence of extending credit and or carrying investment positions 
we require that all securities be rated investment grade at the time of purchase 
we use specific criteria to judge the credit quality and liquidity of our investments and use a variety of credit rating services to monitor these criteria 
the percentage distribution of our debt securities  at amortized cost  by credit rating as of december was as follows aaa aa a bbb bb debt security purchases were as follows aaa aa a bbb the overall credit quality of our portfolio remains high 
our investment policy prohibits us from purchasing below investment grade securities 
in the event of a credit rating downgrade  we do not automatically liquidate our position 
rather  investment management carefully reviews the investment and updates its credit analysis to determine if the investment should be impaired and or liquidated

we entered into cross currency swaps that effectively convert the dollar denominated principal and interest of these notes into yen denominated obligations 
the notional amount of the cross currency swaps is million billion yen with a blended fixed interest rate of in yen 
at december   the fair value of the swaps was an asset of million  compared with million in for our yen denominated loans  the principal amounts as stated in dollars fluctuate due to changes in the yen dollar exchange rate 
we have designated these yen denominated borrowings and the cross currency swaps as a hedge of our investment in aflac japan

defined benefit pension plans aflac us and aflac japan have defined benefit pension plans that cover substantially all full time employees 
general market conditions and the actuarial assumptions used to value our plans assets and liabilities have a significant impact on plan costs and the reported values of plan assets and liabilities 
generally  the plans are funded annually  with minimum contributions required by applicable regulations  including amortization of unfunded prior service cost 
we believe the discount rates  as supported by our consulting actuaries and used in the valuations of our us and japanese plans  are reasonable 
at december   other liabilities included a liability for both plans in the amount of million  compared with million a year ago and shareholders equity reflected a noncash charge of million for the minimum pension liability associated with our us plan 
in consolidated pension expense was million  compared with million in pension expense for is expected to be approximately million for the us plan and million yen million using the december  exchange rate for the japanese plan

policyholder protection fund and state guaranty association assessments in  the japanese government established the life insurance policyholders protection corporation lippc 
funding by the life insurance industry is generally made over a ten year period 
we recognize charges for our estimated share of the industry s obligation once it is determinable 
we review the estimated liability for policyholder protection fund contributions on an annual basis and report any adjustments in net earnings 
exh 
aflac incorporated form k 
exh table of contents in december  we received a formal proposal regarding additional funding for the lippc 
the proposal was drafted by the fsa and submitted to aflac through the life insurance association of japan and japan s lippc 
the proposal included an extension of the japanese government s pledge to enact fiscal safety net measures of up to billion yen until march  and for the industry to contribute an additional billion yen to the lippc 
in addition to the bankruptcy laws that allow for the rehabilitation of life insurers  these funds will be used to support policyholder obligations of failed life insurance companies 
despite our vote against the proposal  it passed when members of the lippc voted on december  we recorded an after tax charge of million  or 
per diluted share  for our estimated portion of the additional industry contribution 
under insurance guaranty association laws in most us states  insurance companies doing business in those states can be assessed for policyholder losses up to prescribed limits that are incurred by insolvent companies with similar lines of business 
such assessments have not been material to us in the past 
we believe that future assessments relating to companies in the united states currently involved in insolvency proceedings will not materially impact our financial position or results of operations 
capital resources and liquidity the principal sources of cash for our insurance operations are premiums and investment income 
the primary uses of cash by our insurance operations are policy claims  commissions  operating expenses  income taxes and payments to aflac incorporated for management fees and dividends 
both the sources and uses of cash are reasonably predictable 
our investment objectives provide for liquidity through the ownership of investment grade debt securities 
aflac insurance policies generally are not interest sensitive and therefore are not subject to unexpected policyholder redemptions due to investment yield changes 
also  the majority of aflac s policies provide fixed benefit amounts rather than reimbursement for actual medical costs and therefore generally are not subject to the risks of medical cost inflation 
the nebraska insurance department imposes certain limitations and restrictions on payments of dividends  management fees  loans and advances by aflac to aflac incorporated 
the nebraska insurance statutes require prior approval for dividend distributions that exceed the greater of the net gain from operations  which excludes net realized investment gains  for the previous year determined under statutory accounting principles  or of statutory capital and surplus as of the previous year end 
in addition  the nebraska insurance department must approve service arrangements and other transactions within the affiliated group 
these regulatory limitations are not expected to affect the level of management fees or dividends paid by aflac to aflac incorporated 
a life insurance company s statutory capital and surplus is determined according to rules prescribed by the national association of insurance commissioners naic  as modified by the insurance department in the insurance compa ny s state of domicile 
statutory accounting rules are different from gaap and are intended to emphasize policyholder protection and company solvency 
the continued long term growth of our business may require increases in the statutory capital and surplus of our insurance operations 
aflac s insurance operations may secure additional statutory capital through various sources  such as internally generated statutory earnings or equity contributions by aflac incorporated from funds generated through debt or equity offerings 
the naic s risk based capital formula is used by insurance regulators to facilitate identification of inadequately capitalized insurance companies 
the formula evaluates insurance risk  business risk  asset risk and interest rate risk by weighing the types and mixtures of exh 
aflac incorporated form k 
exh table of contents risks inherent in the insurer s operations 
aflac s naic risk based capital ratio remains high and reflects a very strong capital and surplus position 
currently  the naic has ongoing regulatory initiatives relating to revisions to the risk based capital formula as well as numerous initiatives covering insurance products  investments  and other actuarial and accounting matters 
we believe that we will continue to maintain a strong risk based capital ratio and statutory capital and surplus position in future periods 
in addition to restrictions by us insurance regulators  the fsa may not allow transfers of funds from aflac japan if the transfers would cause aflac japan to lack sufficient financial strength for the protection of policyholders 
the fsa maintains its own solvency standards  a version of risk based capital requirements 
aflac japan s solvency margin ratio significantly exceeds regulatory minimums 
payments are made from aflac japan to aflac incorporated for management fees and to aflac us for allocated expenses and remittances of earnings 
during  aflac japan paid million to aflac incorporated for management fees  compared with million in both and in  expenses allocated to aflac japan were million  compared with million in and million in during  aflac japan also remitted profits of million billion yen to aflac us  compared with million billion yen in and million billion yen in for additional information on regulatory restrictions on dividends  profit transfers and other remittances  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
for the japanese reporting fiscal year ended march   aflac japan adopted a new japanese statutory accounting standard regarding fair value accounting for investments 
previously  debt securities were generally reported at amortized cost for fsa purposes 
under the new accounting standard  aflac japan s debt securities have been classified as either available for sale or held to maturity 
under this new regulatory accounting standard  the unrealized gains and losses on debt securities available for sale are reported in fsa capital and surplus and reflected in the solvency margin ratio 
this new accounting standard may result in significant fluctuations in fsa equity  aflac japan s solvency margin ratio and amounts available for annual profit repatriation 
aflac incorporated s insurance operations continue to provide the primary sources of its liquidity through dividends and management fees 
we occasionally access debt and equity security markets to provide additional sources of capital 
see discussion on page under notes payable 
capital is primarily used to fund business expansion  capital expenditures and our share repurchase program we believe outside sources for additional debt and equity capital  if needed  will continue to be available 
aflac incorporated received dividends from aflac in the amount of million in  compared with million in and million in the increase in dividends resulted from management s decision to remove excess capital from japan in an effort to achieve better investment returns in the united states
