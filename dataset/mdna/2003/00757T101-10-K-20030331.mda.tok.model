item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations of the company should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company and the related notes 
background we entered the neuromodulation market in through the acquisition of a company that had developed and marketed a radio frequency rf neurostimulation system 
in  we elected to reposition our business to focus exclusively on the neuromodulation market 
implementation of this strategy involved selling our cardiovascular and intravenous fluid product lines in january through our initiatives  we developed and launched our next generation neurostimulation system  the renew rf spinal cord stimulation system  in we also recently developed our genesis and genesisxp totally implantable pulse generator ipg spinal cord stimulation systems 
we began selling genesis in europe in and in the us in subsequent to the fda s approval of our pma application in november  and our genesisxp ipg system following fda approval  in the fourth quarter of in  we completed development of accurx  our constant rate implantable drug pump  in part using proprietary technology we licensed from implantable devices limited partnership idp 
we initiated us clinical trials of accurx under an investigational device exemption ide in the first quarter of  and began selling accurx in certain international markets in the second quarter of on january   we strengthened our position in the neuromodulation market by acquiring the assets of idp and esox technology holdings  llc esox for  shares of our common stock valued at approximately million 
this acquisition provided us with intellectual property surrounding implantable drug pump technologies in all applications  including pain and cancer therapy 
also on january   we completed the acquisition of hdi  a privately held oem developer and manufacturer  for approximately million shares of our common stock 
we accounted for this acquisition using the pooling of interests method and  accordingly  the financial information for all periods prior to the acquisition has been restated 
prior to the acquisition  hdi developed and manufactured our genesis ipg as well as the transmitter for our renew system 
acquiring hdi provided us with additional in house expertise in the design and manufacture of highly sophisticated electromechanical devices 
combined with our capabilities in the design and manufacture of implantable leads  electronic device control and communication systems and implantable drug pumps  we believe hdi s expertise will allow us to develop more sophisticated products in less time 
additionally  hdi continues to provide contract development and manufacturing services to third parties  which we report as a separate segment for financial reporting purposes the oem segment 
for the year ended december   our oem segment provided million or of our total revenue 
in the future  we expect our oem segment revenue to decrease as a percentage of our total revenue as we grow revenue from our proprietary neurostimulation systems and drug pumps and increasingly utilize hdi s research and development capabilities for internal product development 
in november  we completed the acquisition of micronet medical  inc  a privately held developer of medical devices based on proprietary micro lead technology 
micronet developed a line of very thin and steerable spinal cord stimulation leads called axxess 
these leads are the smallest neurostimulation leads on the market  which we believe offers advantages in certain applications 
under the terms of the transaction  which we structured as a merger  we acquired only micronet s proprietary technology and certain associated tangible assets 
micronet s operations  other tangible assets  certain liabilities and certain employees became part of a separate unaffiliated company 
we assumed no material debt  liabilities  or overhead in the transaction 
at closing  we paid the former micronet shareholders  in cash and  shares of our common stock with a value at the time of issuance of  in addition  we incurred expenses of  including an investment banking fee of  in march  subsequent to the fiscal year  we paid the former micronet shareholders an aggregate of  shares of our common stock with a value at the time of issuance and release from escrow of  upon the successful completion of half of the first product milestone  and the former micronet shareholders may receive additional shares of our common stock if certain additional product  regulatory approval and sales milestones are met 
the aggregate value of the additional potential milestone earnout payments was million as measured at the time the transaction was completed 
important additional product milestone deadlines occur twelve and eighteen months following the closing  while other milestones depend on the receipt of regulatory approvals and meeting an aggregate sales milestone 
all milestones must be met within the next four to five years  depending on the milestone 
page our current neuromodulation product line includes our genesis ipg system  genesisxp ipg system  renew rf system and accurx constant rate drug pump 
with the launch of our genesis and genesisxp ipg systems  we now compete in of the implantable neurostimulation market to treat chronic pain of the trunk and limbs 
the launch of the genesis ipg and genesisxp ipg in slowed our growth rate in sales of renew systems from an average percentage growth rate of the mid teens over the past several years to single digit growth in management believes this trend may continue in and has assumed similar single digit growth in renew sales during critical accounting policies and estimates general our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to product returns  bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  warranty obligations and contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we generate revenues from product sales to end customers  product sales to distributors  and development contracts 
we recognize revenue from neuro product sales when the goods are shipped to our customers or distributors  provided an arrangement exists  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
certain of our customers are third party payors who reimburse fixed amounts for services based on a specific diagnosis 
revenue is recognized on these third party payor sales based on the sales price less a contractual adjustment  which is based on our history of reimbursement with the third party payor  provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
we record  as a reduction in revenue a provision for estimated sales returns and adjustments on these product sales in the same period as the related revenue is recorded 
these estimates are based on historical sales returns  analysis of credit memo data  and other known factors 
payment received in advance of revenue recognition requirements are recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet 
we recognize revenue from custom manufactured products at hdi when the goods are shipped to the customer 
hdi also develops products for certain customers under fixed price research and development contracts 
we recognize revenue and profit under the development agreements using the percentage of completion method  which relies on estimates of total expected revenue and costs 
we follow this method since reasonably dependable estimates of revenue and costs applicable to various stages of a development agreement can be made 
if we do not accurately estimate the resources required or the scope of work to be performed under a development agreement  then future profit margins and results of operations may be negatively impacted 
in certain cases  hdi will undertake a development project on a cost plus basis 
in these cases  we invoice and recognize revenue for actual time and material expended on the project at contractual hourly billing rates and markups 
page bad debt we are required to estimate the collectibility of our trade receivables 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the ultimate realization of the receivables  including the current credit worthiness of each customer  the aging of receivables and our historical experience 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances or write offs may be required 
inventory reserve our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory is based upon forecasted demand for our products 
if the demand for our products is less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs or write offs may be required 
intangible assets goodwill associated with the excess purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired was amortized using the straight line method through december  over the estimated life of years 
on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under the new accounting rules  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the statements 
we determined that our goodwill at december  was unimpaired and eliminated amortization of the goodwill effective january  prior to the adoption of these statements  our amortization expense for goodwill was  on an annual basis 
other identifiable definite lived intangible assets  such as patents  purchased technology  trademarks and covenants not to compete  are amortized using the straight line method over their useful lives 
in assessing the recoverability of our intangible assets  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
page warranty obligations our products are generally covered by a one year warranty 
we accrue a warranty reserve for estimated costs to provide warranty services 
our estimate of costs to service our warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectation of future conditions 
to the extent we experience increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims  our warranty accrual will increase resulting in decreased gross profit 
contingencies we are subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims related to our products and business 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies are made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach  such as a change in settlement strategy  in dealing with these matters 
currently  product liability claims and other ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business are the only litigation to which we are a party 
while historically our product liability claims have not resulted in significant monetary liability beyond our insurance coverage  an adverse judgment beyond our insurance coverage could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
stock compensation see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the application of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and sfas  accounting for stock based compensation an amendment of fasb statement no 
to our stock compensation programs 
results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and net income 
we reported net income of million  or 
per diluted share  in compared to million  or 
per diluted share  in financial results in reflect the january us launch of our genesis ipg system and december us launch of our genesisxp ipg system 
results for the period reflect amortization expense for goodwill of  the results contain no similar expense since we eliminated the amortization of goodwill on january  when we adopted the new accounting standards for intangible assets described above 
if the amortization expense for goodwill were eliminated from the period  pro forma net income would be million and pro forma net income per diluted share would be 
net revenue 
net revenue increased to million compared to million in the comparable period 
net revenue of our neuromodulation products increased to million in from million in due to the us launch of our genesis ipg system in january and our genesisxp ipg system in december net revenue from our hdi oem business increased marginally to million in from million in as we continue to focus more of hdi s resources on our own manufacturing and research and development needs 
the launch of the genesis ipg in slowed our growth rate in sales of renew systems from an average percentage growth rate in the mid teens over the past several years to single digit growth in management believes this trend may continue in and has assumed similar single digit growth in renew sales during page gross profit 
gross profit increased to million in from million in due to the increase in net revenue discussed above and an improvement in gross profit margins 
gross profit margins increased to in  compared to in  due to higher sales of our neuromodulation products  which contribute higher margins than oem product sales  higher neuromodulation product sales from direct sales and commissioned agents  which contribute higher margins than distributor sales  and operational efficiencies gained from higher manufacturing volumes 
operating expenses 
total operating expenses the aggregate of research and development  sales and marketing  general and administrative and amortization of intangibles expense increased to million in  compared to million in however  as a percentage of net revenue  these expenses decreased to in from in due to leveraging of research and development expense  leveraging of general and administrative expense  and to a lesser extent  eliminating amortization expense of goodwill 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expense  as a percentage of net revenue  increased to in from in  and the absolute dollar amount increased to million in compared to million during this dollar increase during compared to was principally attributable to higher salary and benefit expense from staffing additions in direct sales  reimbursement and sales support positions  higher commission expense from increased product sales  and higher sample and promotional expense in support of the genesis and genesisxp ipg launches 
research and development 
research and development expense increased to million  or of net revenue  from million  or of net revenue  during the same period in this increase in the absolute dollar amount in compared to was principally attributable to higher salary and benefit expense from staffing additions  higher test material expense and higher expense associated with our clinical trials of accurx 
we continue to focus our development efforts on further broadening and strengthening our product technology platforms both for stimulation devices as well as implantable drug pumps 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense increased to million during from million in and  as a percentage of net revenue  decreased to in from in the increase in the absolute dollar amount in compared to was principally attributable to higher salary expense from staffing additions including a new executive officer position  higher employee benefit costs  higher bonus expense  higher property tax expense and higher fees for accounting and tax services 
amortization of intangibles 
no amortization expense of goodwill was recorded in due to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
and statement of financial accounting standards no 
on january  during  we recorded  for amortization expense of goodwill 
amortization of other intangibles increased modestly in to  from  in due to additional amortization expense for intangible assets acquired in november when we completed the acquisition of micronet medical  inc as a result of the micronet acquisition  we expect amortization expense to increase in by approximately  excluding additional amortization expense that may be generated as we acquire additional intangible assets 
we expect to acquire the additional intangible assets as milestones are met pursuant to the purchase agreement 
as the milestones are met  we will be required to issue additional shares of our common stock as earn out consideration 
page other income 
other income increased to  in from an expense of  in primarily attributable to a  increase in interest income due to higher funds available for investment from our public offering during the second quarter of and the expense in of  for costs associated with the acquisition of hdi 
these costs were expensed instead of capitalized because the acquisition was accounted for under the pooling of interests method 
income tax expense 
income tax expense increased to million in from million in  and the overall effective tax rate was in compared to in the decrease in the effective tax rate in compared to was the result of three factors 
first  our amortization of goodwill in the period was not deductible for tax purposes 
second  the hdi acquisition costs expensed in the period of  were not fully deductible for tax purposes 
finally  the period included tax free interest income 
comparison of the years ended december  and net income 
we reported net income of million  or 
per diluted share  in compared to  or 
per diluted share  in the results for include a pretax expense of  for costs associated with our acquisition of hdi on january  these costs were expensed instead of capitalized because the acquisition was accounted for under the pooling of interests method 
net revenue 
net revenue of million for the year ended december  increased from the comparable level of million 
this growth was attributable to both continued strong sales of our advanced neuromodulation products used to treat chronic pain  which increased to million  and higher sales at hdi  which increased to million 
on november   we received approval from the fda to begin marketing our genesis ipg in the united states  and the first implants occurred in late december we formally launched the genesis ipg in the united states in january gross profit 
gross profit increased to million in from million in due to the increase in net revenue discussed above and an improvement in gross profit margins 
gross profit margins increased to in  compared to in  due to higher sales of our renew system  which contributes higher margins than hdi product sales  a reduction in specialty distributor sales where we recognize lower margins than sales through commissioned sales agents and operational efficiencies from higher manufacturing volumes 
operating expenses 
total operating expenses the aggregate of research and development  sales and marketing  amortization of intangibles and general and administrative expenses increased to million in  compared to million in  and  as a percentage of net revenue  increased to in from in in  we continued to invest in our product development pipeline and in infrastructure to enhance our sales and marketing capabilities 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expense  as a percentage of net revenue  increased to in from in  and the absolute dollar amount increased to million in from million during this dollar increase during was attributable to higher commission expense from increased product sales and a change from distributors to commissioned sales agents in certain united states territories  higher salary and benefit expense from staffing additions in reimbursement and direct sales personnel  higher expense for education and training of new implanters and higher expense for new product introductions 
page research and development 
research and development expense increased to million in  or of net revenue  from million  or of net revenue  during the same period in this increase in the absolute dollar amount in compared to was the result of higher consulting expense and test material expense 
during  these expenditures were directed toward development of our ipg stimulation system platforms for spinal cord stimulation  our next generation rf system platform  our proprietary constant rate drug pump and an ipg system for deep brain stimulation 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense decreased to million during from million in and  as a percentage of net revenue  decreased to in from during the decrease in this expense during was principally the result of lower salary expense from a reduction in certain salaries of the former owners of hdi when we acquired hdi in january amortization of intangibles 
amortization of goodwill and other intangibles increased to million in from million in primarily due to additional amortization expense for patents we acquired from esox on january  other income 
other income decreased to an expense of  in from income of  in  primarily as a result of an expense in of  for costs associated with the acquisition of hdi and lower interest income due to lower yields on invested funds 
income tax expense 
income tax expense increased to million in from  in  and the overall effective tax rate was in compared to in our expense for amortization of costs in excess of net assets acquired  or goodwill  is not deductible for tax purposes  and  when combined with a provision for state taxes  results in the higher effective tax rate during both and compared to the us statutory rate for corporations of 
in addition  approximately  of the  of costs incurred in the acquisition of hdi are not deductible for tax purposes  which also contributed to the higher effective tax rate during compared to the us statutory rate of 
liquidity and capital resources at december  our working capital increased to million from million at year end the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was at december   compared to at december  cash  cash equivalents  certificates of deposit and marketable securities totaled million at december  compared to million at december  during the second quarter of  we completed an underwritten public offering of  shares of common stock managed by us bancorp piper jaffray  cibc world markets and gerard klauer mattison as underwriters 
we received net proceeds from the offering of approximately million 
we intend to use the proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes  including expanding our worldwide sales and marketing resources  funding product development  pursuing regulatory approvals and pursuing strategic acquisitions of product lines  businesses  companies  services or technologies that complement our current business through mergers  acquisitions  joint ventures or otherwise 
we discuss below certain transactions and investments we have made since the public offering in which we have used cash 
in addition  in march  we acquired sun medical s pain management business  which will expand our direct domestic salesforce  for approximately million in cash 
in january  we invested million in cash in innovative spinal technologies  inc  a start up company that develops spine technologies  products and services through intellectual property development and contract research 
page we increased our investment in inventories to million at december   from million at december  this increase from year end was primarily the result of two factors 
first  we increased our investment in consignment inventories as a result of adding additional commissioned sales agents during to whom we provide consignment inventory 
second  we increased our investment in raw materials and finished goods for our genesis and genesisxp ipg systems to support our successful launch of these products in the us market 
our investment in trade accounts receivable increased to million at december   from million at december  due to the increase in sales of our neuromodulation products resulting from the launch of the genesis and genesisxp ipg systems 
our days sales outstanding decreased from days at year end to days at year end in november  we completed the acquisition of micronet medical  inc at closing we paid the former micronet shareholders  in cash and  shares of our common stock with a value at the time of issuance of  in addition  we incurred expenses of  including an investment banking fee of  as previously noted  in march  we paid the former micronet shareholders an aggregate of  shares of our common stock with a value at the time of issuance and release from escrow of  upon the successful completion of half of the first product milestone  and the former micronet shareholders may receive additional shares of our common stock if certain additional product  regulatory approval and sales milestones are met 
the aggregate value of the additional potential milestone earnout payments was million as measured at the time the transaction was completed 
important additional product milestone deadlines occur twelve and eighteen months following the closing  while other milestones depend on the receipt of regulatory approvals and meeting an aggregate sales milestone 
all milestones must be met within the next four to five years  depending on the milestone 
we spent million during for capital expenditures primarily for new furniture and equipment for personnel we hired during and additional manufacturing tooling and equipment to support our current products 
because we expect our business to continue to grow at rates that will demand added office and facility space  we acquired approximately acres of land in december for approximately million 
the land is located in plano  texas  near our current corporate headquarters 
our current lease on our  square foot corporate headquarters expires in august we intend to build a new corporate headquarters facility on the land and relocate to the new facility upon the expiration of our lease in august we are designing the new facility to accommodate planned growth within a five year horizon and anticipate that the facility will contain  to  square feet and cost between million and million 
while we have not yet determined the method by which we will finance the facility  we believe our cash position and overall balance sheet position provides us with various financing alternatives  including financing the facility from our current cash  financing through a debt vehicle such as a mortgage or other form of note  or a sale and leaseback transaction 
liquidity may also be enhanced based on our ability to utilize all or part of a net operating loss of million to offset future taxable income 
we acquired the net operating loss in connection with the micronet medical acquisition and its utilization may be subject to a limitation under section of the internal revenue code 
we believe our current cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our current levels of operating needs and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
we currently have no credit facilities in place 
if we decide to acquire complementary businesses  product lines or technologies  or enter into joint ventures or strategic alliances that require substantial capital  we intend to finance those activities by the most attractive alternative available  which could include utilizing our current cash  bank borrowings  or the issuance of debt or equity securities 
page cash flows net cash provided by operating activities was million in  million in and  in net cash provided by operating activities increased from million in to million in  an increase of approximately million 
this increase in compared to was principally attributable to a million increase in net income from million in to million in net cash provided by operating activities increased from  in to million in  an increase of approximately million 
this increase in compared to was primarily the result of an increase in net income of  and a million decrease in the amount of cash used for changes in working capital components

during  we used  to reduce certain debt obligations  while we received million of cash from the exercise of stock options million  the private placement of common stock  and proceeds from a long term note payable 
currency fluctuations substantially all of our international sales are denominated in us dollars 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates in other countries could reduce the demand for our products by increasing the price of our products in the currency of the countries in which the products are sold  although we do not believe currency fluctuations have had a material effect on the company s results of operations to date 
page outlook and uncertainties the following is a safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of certain matters discussed in this annual report on form k contain statements that constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
the words expect  estimate  anticipate  predict  believe  plan  will  should  intend  would  scheduled  new market  potential market applications  and similar expressions and variations are intended to identify forward looking statements 
such statements appear in a number of places in this annual report on form k and include statements regarding our intent  belief or current expectations with respect to  among other things i trends affecting our financial condition or results of operations  ii our financing plans  and iii our business growth strategies 
we caution our readers that any forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of various factors 
these risks and uncertainties include the following failure of our genesis and genesisxp ipg systems to gain and maintain market acceptance would adversely affect our revenue growth and profitability 
we formally introduced our genesis ipg system in the us in january and our genesisxp ipg system offering increased battery capacity and longevity in the us in december we believe that the size and potential for growth of the ipg portion of the neurostimulation market are greater than in the rf portion 
accordingly  our ability to generate increased revenue and profitability  and thus our general success  will depend  in large part  on the market s acceptance of our ipg systems 
as a new entrant into the ipg portion of the neurostimulation market  there are many reasons we might not achieve market acceptance on a timely basis  if at all  including the following competing products  technologies and therapies are available  and others may be introduced that gain greater and faster physician and patient acceptance than our ipg systems  and our only competitor in the ipg portion of the market has had its ipg product on the market for some time and enjoys significant brand awareness and other advantages among pain management specialists 
if the ipg portion of the neurostimulation market grows at a faster rate than the rf portion  our failure to successfully market and sell our ipg systems could negatively affect our revenue growth and profitability 
because our main competitor has significantly greater resources than we do and new competitors may enter the neuromodulation market  it may be difficult for us to compete in this market 
the medical device market is highly competitive  subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants 
medtronic  inc is one of the largest competitors in the medical device sector  and is currently our sole competitor in the neurostimulation market and our largest competitor in the implantable drug pump market 
medtronic is a large publicly traded company and enjoys several competitive advantages over us  including substantially greater name recognition  greater resources for product research and development  sales and marketing  distribution  patent protection and pursuing regulatory approvals  a greater number of established relationships with health care professionals and third party payors  and multiple product lines and the ability to bundle products together or offer discounts  rebates or other incentives to secure a competitive advantage 
page medtronic will continue to develop new products that compete directly with our products  and its greater resources may allow it to respond more quickly to new technologies  new treatment indications or changes in customer requirements 
further  we generally price our products at a premium to those of medtronic 
additionally  because the neuromodulation market is a high growth potential market  other companies may attempt to bring new products or therapies into this market 
for example  we are aware that advanced bionics  inc  a privately held company that currently manufactures and markets a cochlear implant product  is developing and may be testing an ipg system for the treatment of chronic pain 
for all of these reasons  we may not be able to compete successfully against medtronic or against future competitors 
if pain management specialists do not recommend and endorse our products  our sales could be negatively impacted and we may be unable to increase our revenues and profitability 
our products are based on evolving concepts and techniques in pain management 
acceptance of our products depends on educating the medical community as to the distinctive features  benefits  clinical efficacy  safety and cost effectiveness of our products compared to alternative therapies and competing products  and on training pain management specialists in the proper use of our products 
to sell our products  we must successfully educate and train pain management specialists so that they will understand our products and feel comfortable recommending and endorsing them 
we may not be able to accomplish this  and even if we are successful in educating and training pain management specialists  there is no guarantee that we will obtain their recommendations and endorsements 
the launch of genesis and genesisxp and other market factors could impede growth in or reduce sales of renew  which would adversely affect our revenues and profitability 
ourgenesis and genesisxp ipg systems are currently the newest neurostimulation products on the market 
although genesis and our renew rf system are targeted towards patients with different types of pain and genesis is not intended to replace renew in the neurostimulation market  some pain management specialists may recommend genesis to their patients when they would have otherwise recommended renew  and  consequently  genesis may cannibalize or substitute for some sales of renew 
further  we believe our principal market competitor has chosen to emphasize the ipg as the therapy of choice in the neurostimulation market 
these factors could lead to a slowdown in growth  or a reduction  in sales of renew and similar rf based neurostimulation products 
although renew and genesis are targeted for different patients  sales growth of renew has slowed since the launch of genesis 
if renew sales growth continues to slow or sales are reduced  and we do not gain enough market share through ipg sales to compensate for these reduced sales  our revenues and profitability will be adversely affected 
if patients choose less invasive or less expensive alternatives to our products  our sales could be negatively impacted 
we sell medical devices for invasive and minimally invasive surgical procedures 
patient acceptance of our products depends on a number of factors  including device and associated procedure costs  the failure of less invasive therapies to help the patient  the degree of invasiveness involved in the procedures used to implant our products  the rate and severity of complications from the procedures used to implant our products and any adverse side effects caused by the implanting of our products 
if patients choose to use existing less invasive or less expensive alternatives to our products  or if effective new alternatives are developed  our revenues and profitability could be materially adversely affected 
page any adverse changes in coverage or reimbursement amounts by medicare and medicaid  private insurance companies and managed care organizations  or workers compensation programs could limit our ability to market and sell our products 
in the us  our products are generally covered by medicare and medicaid and other third party payors  such as private insurance companies and managed care organizations  and workers compensation programs  which reimburse patients for all or part of the cost of our products and related medical procedures 
the cost of our products and related procedures are significant  and third party payors carefully scrutinize whether to cover new products and the level of reimbursement for covered products 
from time to time  payors may refuse to reimburse our customers for all or a portion of the cost of our products  and we may discount our product cost below expected selling prices or offer other payment accommodations to customers in order to increase the likelihood of reimbursement 
further  for certain types of procedures  gaps exist between the rate of reimbursement paid by medicare and medicaid and the rates paid by private insurers 
in addition  gaps exist in reimbursement levels depending on the health care setting in which physicians perform procedures using our products 
in the future  these gaps may narrow and public and private payors may reduce levels of reimbursement for neuromodulation devices in an effort to control increasing costs 
if medicare or other third party payors decide to eliminate or reduce coverage amounts on patient reimbursements for our products  this could limit our ability to market and sell our products in the us  which would materially adversely affect our revenues and profitability 
in november  for example  the center for medicare and medicaid services cms issued a final ruling establishing new reimbursement rates for medicare hospital outpatient procedures 
reimbursement levels for permanent implants of spinal cord stimulation devices in the hospital outpatient setting were reduced as a result of the ruling 
cms could decide to further reduce reimbursement rates for our products in the same or other patient settings in and beyond 
international market acceptance of our products may also depend  in part  upon the availability of reimbursement within prevailing health care payment systems 
reimbursement and health care payment systems in international markets vary significantly by country  and include both government sponsored health care and private insurance 
we may not obtain international reimbursement approvals in a timely manner  if at all 
where reimbursement in foreign markets is available  it tends to be at levels significantly below those in the us our failure to receive international reimbursement approvals may negatively impact market acceptance of our products in the international markets in which those approvals are sought 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights  our competitors may take advantage of our ideas and compete directly against us 
we rely in part on patents  certain of which are due to expire between and  as well as trade secrets and proprietary technology  to remain competitive 
we may not be able to obtain or maintain adequate us patent protection for new products or ideas  or prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our technical knowledge or other trade secrets by employees 
additionally  the laws of foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us even if our intellectual property rights are adequately protected  litigation may be necessary to enforce them  which could result in substantial costs to us and substantial diversion of the attention of our management and key technical employees 
if we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property  our competitors could use our intellectual property to develop new products or enhance their existing products 
this could harm our competitive position  decrease our market share or otherwise harm our business 
page other parties may sue us for infringing their intellectual property rights  or we may have to sue them to protect our intellectual property rights 
there has been a substantial amount of litigation in the medical technology industry regarding patents and intellectual property rights 
the neuromodulation market is characterized by extensive patent and other intellectual property rights  which can create greater potential than in less developed markets for possible allegations of infringement  particularly with respect to newly developed technology 
we may be forced to defend ourselves against allegations that we are infringing the intellectual property rights of others 
in addition  we may find it necessary  if threatened  to initiate a lawsuit seeking a declaration from a court that we are not infringing the intellectual property rights of others or that these rights are invalid or unenforceable  or to protect our own intellectual property rights 
intellectual property litigation is expensive and complex and its outcome is difficult to predict 
if we do not prevail in any litigation  in addition to any damages we might have to pay  we would be required to stop the infringing activity  obtain a license  or concede intellectual property rights 
any required license may not be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all 
in addition  some licenses may be nonexclusive  and  therefore  our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us 
if we fail to obtain a required license or are unable to design around a patent  we may be unable to sell some of our products  which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability 
failure to obtain necessary government approvals for new products or for new applications for existing products would mean we could not sell those new products  or sell our existing products for those new applications 
our products are medical devices  which are subject to extensive government regulation in the us and in foreign countries where we do business 
unless an exemption applies  each medical device that we wish to market in the us must first receive either a premarket approval pma or a k clearance from the fda with respect to each application for which we intend to market it 
either process can be lengthy and expensive 
according to the fda  the average k review period was days in  but reviews may take longer and approvals may be revoked if safety or effectiveness problems develop 
the pma process is much more costly  lengthy and uncertain 
according to the fda  the average pma submission to decision period was days in  however  reviews may take much longer and completing a pma application can require numerous clinical trials and require the filing of amendments over time 
the result of these lengthy approval processes is that a new product  or a new application for an existing product  often cannot be brought to market for a number of years after it is developed 
additionally  we anticipate that many of the products we bring to market in the future will require us to seek pma approvals rather than k clearances 
if we fail to obtain or maintain necessary government approvals of our new products or new applications for existing products on a timely and cost effective basis  we will be unable to market the affected products for their intended applications 
modification of any marketed device could require a new k clearance or pma or require us to cease marketing or recall the modified device until we obtain this clearance or approval 
any modification we want to make to an fda cleared or approved device that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness  or that would constitute a major change in its intended use  would require a new k clearance  or possibly a new or supplemental pma 
under fda procedures  we would make the initial determination of whether to seek a new k clearance or pma  but the fda could review our decision 
if the fda disagrees with our decision not to seek a new k clearance or pma and requires us to seek either k clearance or pma for modifications we have already made to a previously cleared product  we might be required to cease marketing or recall the modified device until we obtain this clearance or approval 
we could also be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties 
page we will be unable to sell our products if we fail to comply with manufacturing regulations 
to commercially manufacture our products  we must comply with government manufacturing regulations that govern design controls  quality systems and documentation policies and procedures 
the fda and equivalent foreign governmental authorities periodically inspect our manufacturing facilities 
our failure to comply with these manufacturing regulations may prevent or delay our marketing or distribution of our products  which would negatively impact our business 
our products are subject to product recalls even after receiving fda clearance or approval  which would negatively affect our financial performance and could harm our reputation 
any of our products may be found to have significant deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture 
the fda and similar governmental authorities in other countries have the authority to require the recall of any such defective product 
a government mandated or voluntary recall could occur as a result of component failures  manufacturing errors or design defects 
we do not maintain insurance to cover losses incurred as a result of product recalls 
any product recall would divert managerial and financial resources and negatively affect our financial performance  and could harm our reputation with customers 
we are subject to potential product liability and other claims and we may not have the insurance or other resources to cover the cost of any successful claim 
defects in our implantable medical devices could subject us to potential product liability claims that our devices were ineffective or caused some harm to the human body 
our current product liability litigation involves assertions that our products did not perform as intended and  in some cases  that they caused discomfort or harm to the patient 
our product liability insurance may not be adequate to cover current or future claims 
product liability insurance is expensive and  in the future  may not be available on terms that are acceptable to us  if it is available to us at all 
plaintiffs may also advance other legal theories supporting their claims that our products or actions resulted in some harm 
a successful claim brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage could significantly harm our business and financial condition 
we are subject to substantial government regulation and our failure to comply with all applicable government regulations could subject us to numerous penalties  any of which could adversely affect our business 
we are subject to numerous government regulations relating to  among other things  our ability to sell our products  third party reimbursement  fraud and abuse of medicare or medicaid and patient privacy 
if we do not comply with all applicable government regulations  government authorities could do any of the following impose fines and penalties on us  prevent us from manufacturing our products  bring civil or criminal charges against us  delay the introduction of our new products into the market  recall or seize our products  disrupt the manufacture or distribution of our products  or withdraw or deny approvals for our products 
page any one of these results could materially adversely affect our revenues and profitability and harm our reputation 
our reliance on single suppliers for critical components used in our main products could adversely affect our ability to deliver products on time 
we rely on single suppliers for several critical components used in our main products  including the computer chip used in the receiver of our rf system  the computer chip used in the ipg programmer and renew transmitter  the batteries used in our ipg system and the medical grade polyurethane bionate that we use in all of our products 
if any of our sole source suppliers were to stop supplying us with critical components  our manufacturing operations and our business could be materially harmed  at least in the short term while we located alternative suppliers or modified our product designs to eliminate the need for these components 
the sole supplier of the computer chip used in the receiver of our rf system has indicated its desire to cease manufacturing and supplying the computer chip in the future  but to date has not determined when this will occur 
this supplier has agreed to notify us when a date has been determined and allow us to place a final one time purchase order for the computer chip 
in the interim  we are maintaining a higher than normal inventory of the computer chip and are working to develop a new product design that uses an alternative computer chip 
until we develop this new design  any sudden disruption in supply from our current computer chip supplier could adversely affect our ability to deliver finished rf products on time 
one distributor currently accounts for a significant percentage of our revenue from our neuromodulation products segment  and our major competitor in the neuromodulation market currently accounts for a significant percentage of our revenue from our oem segment 
during  we had one independent distributor  sun medical  inc  that accounted for million  or  of our net revenue from our neuromodulation products segment 
in march  we acquired sun medical s pain management business and hired substantially all of the salespeople who had generated those sales  but we continue to rely in large part on two other distributors and on numerous independent sales representatives to buy and or sell our products 
the loss of a major distributor or sales representative  or a significant decrease in their sales volumes  could materially adversely affect our revenues and profitability  at least in the short term 
in addition  during  we had two major customers that accounted for million  or  of our net revenue from our oem segment 
medtronic  inc  our most significant competitor  accounted for million  or and arrow international  inc accounted for million  or 
either of these customers could cease doing business with us at any time 
if this were to occur  our revenues and profitability could be materially adversely affected  at least in the short term 
we are dependent upon the success of neuromodulation technology 
our inability to continue to develop innovative neuromodulation products  or the failure of the neuromodulation market to develop as we anticipate  would adversely affect our business 
our current products focus on the treatment of chronic pain using neuromodulation 
our development efforts focus on leveraging our neuromodulation expertise 
the neuromodulation market is subject to rapid technological change and product innovation 
our competitors may succeed in developing or marketing products  using neuromodulation technology or other technologies  that may be superior to ours 
if we are unable to compete successfully in the development of new neuromodulation products  or if new and effective therapies not based on neuromodulation are developed  our products could be rendered obsolete or non competitive 
this would materially adversely affect our business 
page our success will depend on our ability to attract and retain key personnel and scientific staff 
we believe our future success will depend on our ability to manage our growth successfully  including attracting and retaining scientists  engineers and other highly skilled personnel 
our key employees are subject to confidentiality  trade secret and non competition agreements  but may terminate their employment with us at any time 
hiring qualified management and technical personnel is difficult due to the limited number of qualified professionals 
competition for these types of employees is intense in the medical device field 
if we fail to attract and retain personnel  particularly management and technical personnel  we may not be able to continue to succeed in the neuromodulation market 
if we choose to acquire complementary businesses  products or technologies instead of developing them ourselves  we may be unable to complete these acquisitions or to successfully integrate an acquired business  product or technology in a cost effective and non disruptive manner 
our success depends on our ability to continually enhance and broaden our product offerings in response to changing technologies  customer demands and competitive pressures 
accordingly  we may  as we have in the past  acquire complementary businesses  products or technologies instead of developing them ourselves 
we do not know if we will be able to identify prospective acquisition targets or complete any future acquisitions  or whether we will be able to successfully integrate any acquired business  operate it profitably or retain its key employees 
integrating any business  product or technology we acquire could be expensive and time consuming  disrupt our ongoing business and distract our management and key technical personnel 
if we are unable to integrate any acquired entities  products or technologies effectively  our business will suffer 
in addition  any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets or charges resulting from the costs of acquisitions could harm our business and operating results 
we are subject to additional risks associated with international operations 
internationally  we market our products through independent distributors who represent us in countries except in germany where we are represented by direct salespersons 
in  of our sales revenue from our neuromodulation products segment came from international sales 
international sales are subject to a number of additional risks  including the following establishment by foreign regulatory agencies of requirements different from those in place in the us  fluctuations in exchange rates of the us dollar against foreign currencies that may affect demand for our products overseas  export license requirements  changes in tariffs  and other general trade restrictions  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  political or economic instability  and lower and more restrictive third party reimbursement for our products 
any of these risks could make it difficult or impossible for us to continue to expand our overseas operations  which could have an adverse effect on our revenues 
page our operations are conducted at three locations  and a disaster at any of these facilities could result in a prolonged interruption of our business 
we currently conduct all of our development  manufacturing and management activities at our facilities in plano  texas and budd lake and hackettstown  new jersey 
however  a natural disaster  such as a tornado  fire or flood  or a man made disaster  could cause substantial delays in our operations  damage or destroy our manufacturing equipment or inventory and cause us to incur significant additional expenses 
a disaster could seriously harm our business and affect our reputation with customers 
the insurance we maintain may not be adequate to cover our losses in any particular case 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest our cash reserves in high quality short term liquid money market instruments with major financial institutions  a high quality short term municipal bond fund with a major financial institution and certificates of deposit 
at december   we had  invested in money market funds   in certificates of deposit with maturities less than days from the purchase date and  in a tax free municipal bond fund with daily liquidity 
the rate of interest earned on these investments will vary with overall market rates 
a hypothetical basis point change in the interest rates earned on these investments would not have a material effect on our income or cash flows 
we also have certain investments in available for sale securities 
these investments primarily consist of investment grade municipal bonds with maturities less than one year from the date of purchase  day and day aaa municipal bond floaters and freddie mac and federal home loan notes with maturities less than one year from the date of purchase 
the cost of these investments is  and the fair value at december  was  the investments are subject to overall bond market and interest rate risk  however the company believes the risk to be limited since a large portion of the investments   are in day and day municipal floaters which have no principal risk 
the investment grade municipal bonds and freddie mac and federal home loan bank notes may have risk of principal depending on the overall bond market 
a hypothetical decrease in the value of these investments from their prices at december  would decrease the fair value by  we do not use derivative financial instruments to manage the impact of interest rate changes on our investments or debt instruments 
at december   we had no interest bearing debt
