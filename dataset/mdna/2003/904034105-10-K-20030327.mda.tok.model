item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview certain of the statements contained in this report may be considered forward looking statements under section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  that involve risks and uncertainties  such as cyclicality in the nanotechnology and semiconductor industries  delays  deferrals and cancellations of orders by customers  customer concentration  dependence on new product introductions and commercial success of any new products  integration and development of the verdant operations  pricing pressures  competition  lengthy sales cycles for the company s systems  ability to volume produce systems and meet customer requirements  the mix of products sold  sole or limited sources of supply  international sales  manufacturing inefficiencies and absorption levels  risks associated with introducing new technologies  inventory obsolescence  economic and political conditions worldwide  delays in collecting accounts receivable  extended payment terms  changes in technologies  and any adverse effects of worldwide terrorist attacks on the economy in general or our business in particular 
due to these and additional factors  certain statements  historical results and percentage relationships discussed below are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for any future period 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements 
by their nature  these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to inventories  warranty obligations  purchase order commitments  bad debts  income taxes  intangible assets  restructuring and contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
the company has reviewed these policies with its audit committee 
revenue recognition the company recognizes product revenue when the contractual obligation for installation if any has been satisfied  or installation is substantially complete  and or customer acceptance provisions have lapsed  provided collections of the related receivable are probable 
in the event of a delay in the installation of our products caused by the customer  we may seek acceptance of the system and warranty commencement after shipment and transfer of title  but prior to completion of installation 
revenue recorded as a result of these customer acceptances is reduced by an amount representing the fair value of installation services 
in these instances  revenue is recorded only if the product has met product specifications prior to shipment and management deems that no significant uncertainties as to product performance exist 
costs incurred for shipping and handling are included in cost of sales 
revenue from spare parts sales is generally recognized upon shipment 
deferred income related to service revenue is recognized ratably over the life of the related service contract 
deferred income relative to the company s licensing activities is recognized over the estimated useful life of the licensed technologies  or the contract period of any technology transfer support arrangements 
inventories and purchase order commitments the company estimates and reserves for the effects on inventory and purchase order commitments of obsolescence and unrealizable carrying values based upon estimates of future demand for its products and market conditions 
with the exception of certain long lead time items  principally optical components  the company presently records reserves for inventories and purchase order commitments in excess of months of production demand 
due to the cyclical nature of the company s business  during periods of peak demand  the company has shortened this production outlook to months of production demand 
had the company used a month production demand horizon as of december   additional inventory and purchase order commitment reserves of million would be required 
should actual production demand differ from management s estimates  revisions to inventory write downs and purchase order commitment reserves would be required 
warranty obligations the company provides for the estimated cost of its product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
the company s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage rates and the efficiency by which the product failure is corrected 
should actual product failure rates  material usage rates and labor efficiencies differ from the company s estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
bad debt the company maintains an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  or even a single customer was otherwise unable to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the average selling price of the company s systems is in excess of million 
accordingly  a single customer default could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
deferred taxes the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
based on the uncertainty of future pre tax income  the company has presently fully reserved its deferred tax assets 
in the event the company was to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation reserve would increase income in the period such determination was made 
results of operations factors that have caused results to fluctuate significantly in the past and most likely will continue to significantly impact results in the future  and could cause actual results to differ materially  include the following cyclicality in the company s served markets  including the current severe downturn in the semiconductor and nanotechnology industries  delays  deferrals and cancellations of orders by customers  customer concentration  high degree of industry competition  market acceptance of new products and enhanced versions of the company s existing products  lengthy and costly development cycles for advanced lithography and laser thermal processing technologies and applications  integration and development of verdant operations  mix of products sold  timing of new product announcements and releases by the company or its competitors  expiration of technology support and licensing arrangements  and the resulting adverse impact on the company s licensing revenues  product discounts  changes in pricing by the company  its competitors or suppliers  timing and degree of success of technologies licensed to outside parties  product concentration and lack of product revenue diversification  outcome of litigation  lengthy sales and manufacturing cycles and the pattern of capital spending by customers  including the timing of system acceptances  inventory obsolescence  manufacturing inefficiencies and the ability to volume produce systems  the ability and resulting costs to attract or retain sufficient personnel to achieve the company s targets for a particular period  dilutive effect of employee stock option grants on net income per share  which is largely dependent upon the company attaining profitability and the market price of the company s stock  sole or limited sources of supply  international sales  rapid technological change and the importance of timely product introductions  future acquisitions  changes to financial accounting standards  intellectual property matters  environmental regulations  any adverse effects of worldwide terrorist attacks on the economy in general or on our business in particular  political and economic instability throughout the world  business interruptions due to natural disasters or utility failures  and regulatory changes  and the other risk factors listed in this filing and other company filings with the sec 
the company undertakes no obligation to update any of its disclosures to reflect such future events 
the company derives a substantial portion of its total net sales from sales of a relatively small number of newly manufactured systems  which typically range in price from  to million for the company s x steppers 
as a result of these high sale prices  the timing and recognition of revenue from a single transaction has had and most likely will continue to have a significant impact on the company s net sales and operating results for any particular period 
the company s backlog at the beginning of a period typically does not include all of the sales needed to achieve the company s sales objectives for that period 
in addition  orders in backlog are subject to cancellation  shipment or customer acceptance delays  and deferral or rescheduling by a customer with limited or no penalties 
consequently  the company s net sales and operating results for a period have been and will continue to be dependent upon the company obtaining orders for systems to be shipped and accepted in the same period in which the order is received 
the company s business and financial results for a particular period could be materially adversely affected if an anticipated order for even one system is not received in time to permit shipment and customer acceptance during that period 
furthermore  a substantial portion of the company s shipments has historically been realized near the end of each quarter 
delays in installation and customer acceptance due  for example  to the inability of the company to successfully demonstrate the agreed upon specifications or criteria at the customer s facility  or to the failure of the customer to permit installation of the system in the agreed upon time  may cause net sales in a particular period to fall significantly below the company s expectations  which may materially adversely affect the company s operating results for that period 
additionally  the failure to receive anticipated orders or delays in shipments due  for example  to rescheduling  delays  deferrals or cancellations by customers  additional customer configuration requirements  or to unexpected manufacturing difficulties or delays in deliveries by suppliers due to their long production lead times or otherwise  have caused and may continue to cause net sales in a particular period to fall significantly below the company s expectations  materially adversely affecting the company s operating results for that period 
in particular  the long manufacturing cycles of the company s saturn spectrum family of wafer steppers  laser thermal processing systems and the long lead time for lenses and other materials  could cause shipments of such products to be delayed from one quarter to the next  which could materially adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operations for a particular quarter 
additionally  the need for continued expenditures for research and development  capital equipment  ongoing training and worldwide customer service and support  among other factors  will make it difficult for the company to reduce its operating expenses in a particular period if the company fails to achieve its net sales goals for the period 
the company experienced weakness in its business during the three month period ended september   as system revenue levels were significantly below that of the preceding and successive periods 
the company believes this weakness may have been seasonal 
the company s present sales goal for the three month period ending september  requires that a substantial number of new system orders  with near term delivery dates  be obtained 
the company s business has  in prior years  been subject to seasonality  although the company believes such seasonality had been masked in more recent years by strong cyclical trends within the semiconductor and nanotechnology industries 
net sales vs 
net sales consist of revenues from system sales  spare parts sales  service and licensing of technologies 
for the year ended december   net sales were million  a decline of as compared with million for the year ended december  system sales decreased  to million  on a unit volume decline of 
excluding reduction lithography systems  which have been discontinued by the company  system sales decreased to million  on a unit volume decline of 
the weighted average selling prices of systems sold  exclusive of reduction systems  declined  due primarily to a higher proportion of refurbished systems sold in and generally weaker market conditions 
in  refurbished systems accounted for approximately of units sold 
geographically  the decline in unit volumes was attributable to or greater declines in all regions the company serves  with the steepest decline occurring in europe 
on a market segment basis  the decline in unit volumes was primarily attributable to a lack of demand from nanotechnology and semiconductor customers 
spare part sales decreased  to million  primarily as a result of decreased utilization of plant capacity within the semiconductor industry and certain system upgrades that occurred in revenues from services declined  to million  primarily as a result of decreased utilization of plant capacity within the semiconductor industry 
revenues from licensing and licensing support arrangements declined to million  as compared with in  as a result of a large technology support agreement that expired in february the company presently anticipates that revenues from licensing and licensing support arrangements will remain at approximately million per quarter for at december   the company had approximately million of deferred revenue resulting from products shipped but not yet installed and accepted  as compared with million at december  this resulted in a net increase in deferred product and services income of approximately million 
during  deferred license income decreased by million  to million  as a result of amortization of proceeds received in prior periods 
amortization of license income results in current period license revenue 
deferred income related to the company s products is recognized upon satisfying the contractual obligations for installation and or customer acceptance 
deferred income related to service revenue is recognized over the life of the related service contract 
deferred income relative to the company s licensing activities is recognized over the estimated useful life of the licensed technologies  or the period of any technology transfer support arrangements 
on a product market application basis  system sales to the semiconductor industry were million for the year ended december   a decrease of as compared with system sales of million in system sales to the semiconductor industry included million and million of reduction stepper systems for the years ended december  and  respectively  including a single system sale of million for the quarter ended december  this decline was primarily attributable to the severely depressed economic environment in the semiconductor industry in particular  and the economy as a whole 
the company discontinued its xls reduction stepper platform in september and has since suspended development of its advanced reduction lithography systems 
system sales to the nanotechnology market were million for the year ended december   a decrease of as compared with sales of million in  primarily as a result of lower demand from microsystems and optical networking customers 
for the year ended december   international net sales were million  or of total net sales  as compared with million  or of total net sales for the company s operations in foreign countries are not generally subject to significant exchange rate fluctuations  principally because sales contracts for the company s systems are generally denominated in us dollars 
in japan  however  orders are often denominated in japanese yen 
this subjects the company to the risk of currency fluctuations 
the company attempts to mitigate this exposure through the use of foreign exchange contracts  however  this effort can be costly and there can be no assurance of the success of any such efforts 
international sales expose the company to a number of additional risks  including fluctuations in the value of local currencies relative to the us dollar  which  in turn  impact the relative cost of ownership of the company s products 
see additional risk factors international sales 
our served markets have been and are presently experiencing severe downturns due  in part  to the macro economic conditions facing the us and world economies 
although the company s level of new orders exceeded the company s revenue during the year ended december   the company also experienced significant levels of order cancellations during the year 
additionally  the company removed from backlog certain system orders that it believes may not be shipped during the next twelve months  as required by company policy 
this decision was predicated on recent customer announcements of declining financial performance and cutbacks in planned capital expenditures 
as a result of these cancellations and restructurings  the company s backlog at december  declined relative to levels at december  the anticipated timing of shipments and customer acceptances will require the company to fill a number of production slots in the current and subsequent quarters in order to meet its near term sales targets 
if the company is unsuccessful in its efforts to secure those production orders  or if existing production orders are delayed or cancelled  its results of operations will be materially adversely impacted in the near term 
accordingly  the company can give no assurance that it will be able to achieve or maintain its current or prior level of sales 
the company presently expects that net sales for the quarter ending march  will be flat to slightly higher than net sales in the comparable period in the company anticipates that it will experience operating and net losses for the three month period ending march  should further declines in the company s outlook for and occur  the company may be required to take additional steps to reduce its future operating expenses and may also require the company to increase its inventory and purchase order commitment reserve positions 
these actions  if required  would materially adversely impact the company s financial condition and results of operations 
because the company s net sales are subject to a number of risks  including intense competition in the capital equipment industry  uncertainty relating to the timing and market acceptance of the company s products and the condition of the macro economy and the semiconductor industry  the company may not exceed or maintain its current or prior level of net sales for any period in the future 
additionally  the company believes that the market acceptance and volume production of its saturn spectrum e  its mm offerings  its laser thermal processing systems and its series family of wafer steppers  are of critical importance to its future financial results 
to the extent that these products do not achieve significant sales due to difficulties involving manufacturing or engineering  the inability to reduce the current long manufacturing cycles for these products  competition  excess capacity in the semiconductor or nanotechnology device industries  customer acceptances  or any other reason  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
vs 
for the year ended december   net sales were million  a decrease of as compared with net sales of million for the year ended december  system sales decreased  to million  on a unit volume decline of 
system sales were favorably impacted by a increase in weighted average selling prices and a change in product mix in favor of the company s more expensive models 
the decline in unit volume was primarily attributable to weaker demand from semiconductor customers throughout the world and thin film head customers in asia  excluding japan  partially offset by higher demand from micro machining and optical networking customers during the first half of spare part sales decreased  to million 
revenues from services declined  to million  primarily as a result of decreased utilization of plant capacity within the semiconductor industry 
revenues from licensing and licensing support arrangements increased to million  from million in  as a result of agreements entered into in late and at december   the company had approximately million of deferred revenue resulting from products shipped but not yet installed and accepted  as compared with million at december   resulting in a net decrease in deferred product and service income of approximately million 
during the year ended december   deferred license income decreased by million  to million  as a result of amortization of proceeds received in  partially offset by certain proceeds received in on a product market application basis  system sales to the semiconductor and semiconductor packaging industries were million for the year ended december   a decrease of as compared with system sales of million in system sales to the nanotechnology market were million  an increase of as compared with sales of million in this increase was primarily attributable to the sale of the company s systems to micro machining and optical networking device customers  partially offset by fewer sales of the company s systems to thin film head customers 
for the year ended december   international net sales were million  or of total net sales  as compared with million  or of total net sales for the decline in international net sales  both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of total net sales  was primarily attributable to decreased sales of the company s saturn spectrum wafer stepper to semiconductor packaging companies in japan 
the company anticipates that a substantial portion of its overall sales will continue to come from sales of its saturn spectrum e wafer stepper to semiconductor packaging manufacturers in the japan and asia  excluding japan territories 
gross profit years ended december  expressed as a of total net sales total net sales cost of products and services sold cost of inventory writedown cost of discontinued products gross margin vs 
the company s gross profit as a percentage of net sales  or gross margin  was for the year ended december   as compared with for the year ended december   inclusive of charges for the cost of inventory writedown of million for the year ended december   and the cost of discontinued products of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
on a comparative basis  gross margins  exclusive of the aforementioned charges  were adversely affected by the lack of capacity utilization 
lack of capacity utilization results in higher levels of unabsorbed overhead 
this adverse impact on gross margins from these lower production levels was partially offset by cost savings associated with the closing of the company s wilmington  massachusetts facility and by other cost reduction measures taken in the second half of gross margins for the quarter ended december  were adversely impacted by recording million of non cash expenses related to prior periods  pursuant to rent averaging requirements under certain of the company s facility leases 
the company does not believe these amounts are material to the periods in which they should have been recorded  nor does it believe the prospective correction of such amounts during the year ended december  is material to its consolidated operating results for such year 
exclusive of licensing and licensing support revenues  gross margin was for the year ended december   as compared with for the year ended december   inclusive of the aforementioned charges 
in september  as a direct result of worsening conditions in the semiconductor industry in particular  and the general economy as a whole  the company discontinued or suspended development of certain advanced reduction lithography programs  including nm  and discontinued certain x products and platforms 
additionally  the company significantly reduced its revenue outlook for as a result  the company recognized inventory write downs of million and additional purchase order commitment reserves of million for the year ended december  in the three month period ended september   as a direct result of dramatically worsening conditions in the semiconductor industry  the company decided to discontinue its xls reduction stepper production and focus its efforts on developing next generation platforms for its reduction technologies  principally nm 
as a result of this decision  the company recognized inventory write downs of million and additional purchase order commitment reserves of million 
the company s gross profit as a percentage of sales has been and most likely will continue to be significantly affected by a variety of factors  including the mix of products sold  inventory and open purchase commitment reserve provisions  the rate of capacity utilization  product discounts and competition in the company s targeted markets  technology support and licensing revenues  which have little  if any  associated cost of sales  non linearity of shipments during the quarter  the introduction of new products  which typically have higher manufacturing costs until manufacturing efficiencies are realized and which are typically discounted more than existing products until the products gain market acceptance  the percentage of international sales  which typically have lower gross margins than domestic sales principally due to higher field service and support costs  and the implementation of subcontracting arrangements 
the company believes that gross margin for the quarter ending march  will be flat  as compared to the comparable period in should further erosion to the company s business occur  the company might incur a higher risk of inventory obsolescence and excess purchase commitments  which would materially adversely impact results of operations 
additionally  increased price based competition may continue to contribute to further erosion of gross margin 
new products generally have lower gross margins until there is widespread market acceptance and until production and after sales efficiencies can be achieved 
should significant market demand fail to develop for the company s mm offerings  its saturn spectrum e or the verdant laser thermal processing system  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
vs 
the company s gross profit as a percentage of net sales  or gross margin  was for the year ended december   as compared with for  inclusive of a charge of million for the cost of discontinued products for the year ended december  on a comparative basis  exclusive of the aforementioned charge  gross margin was favorably affected in by higher weighted average selling prices  increased licensing and licensing support revenues which have no corresponding cost of sales and cost reduction measures 
exclusive of licensing and licensing support revenues  gross margin was for the year ended december   as compared with for  inclusive of the aforementioned charge 
gross margin for was adversely affected by a charge of million relating to the discontinuance of the company s xls product platform  a shift in product mix  and production and after sales inefficiencies caused by lower production and shipment levels 
in the three month period ended september   as a direct result of dramatically worsening conditions in the semiconductor industry  the company decided to discontinue its xls reduction stepper production and focus its efforts on developing next generation platforms for its reduction technologies  principally nm 
as a result of this decision  the company recognized inventory write downs of million and additional purchase order commitment reserves of million 
research  development and engineering expenses vs 
the company s research  development  and engineering expenses were million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the year over year decline in spending was primarily attributable to the discontinuance of the company s xls reduction stepper platform and to other cost reduction measures implemented in the second half of and during research  development  and engineering expenses for the quarter ended december  were adversely impacted by recording million of non cash expenses related to prior periods  pursuant to rent averaging requirements under certain of the company s facility leases 
the company does not believe these amounts are material to the periods in which they should have been recorded  nor does it believe the prospective correction of such amounts during the year ended december  is material to its consolidated operating results for such year 
the company continues to invest significant resources in the development and enhancement of its laser thermal processing systems and technologies and its x optical products and related technologies 
the company presently expects that  as a result of the cost reduction measures taken in september  the absolute dollar amount of research  development and engineering expenses for the quarter ending march  will be lower than expenses incurred for the comparable period in vs 
the company s research  development and engineering expenses were million for the year ended december   as compared with million for the decline in spending was primarily attributable to the shutdown of the company s ultrabeam operations  which occurred early in the second quarter of  and cost containment measures implemented in  partially offset by increased spending on the company s laser thermal processing and x and advanced reduction stepper technologies 
amortization of intangible assets vs 
amortization of intangible assets was million for the year ended december   as compared with million for the year ended december  the year over year reduction in amortization was a direct result of impairment charges recognized in the quarter ended september  relating to certain intangible assets see restructure of operations

selling  general  and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   as compared with million for the year ended december  as a percentage of net sales  selling  general  and administrative expenses increased to  as compared with in the year over year decline  in absolute dollars  was primarily attributable to cost containment measures implemented in the second half of and during  and lower sales and support expenses  including sales commissions  typically associated with a decline in sales 
these cost containment measures included approximately million of executive pay reductions  which ceased as of december  selling  general  and administrative expenses for the quarter ended december  were adversely impacted by recording million of non cash expenses related to prior periods  pursuant to rent averaging requirements under certain of the company s facility leases 
the company does not believe these amounts are material to the periods in which they should have been recorded  nor does it believe the prospective correction of such amounts during the year ended december  is material to its consolidated operating results for such year 
the company presently anticipates that selling  general and administrative expenses for the three month period ending march  will be lower than the comparable period in  due primarily to the cost reduction measures taken in september vs 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   as compared with million for as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to in  as compared with in the decline  in absolute dollars  was primarily attributable to cost containment measures implemented in and lower sales and support expenses  including sales commissions  typically associated with a decline in sales  partially offset by higher legal and consulting expenses incurred in conjunction with the company s restructuring and efforts toward expansion into china 
restructure of operations in september  in response to worsening conditions in the semiconductor industry in particular  and the general economy as a whole  the company decided to reduce its workforce by approximately and to cease or suspend activities related to certain engineering and administrative initiatives 
as a result of this decision  the company recognized a restructuring charge of million  or per share for the three month period ended september  the company reduced this charge by million during the three month period ended december   primarily as a result of canceling its plans to exit a certain building and an adjustment of its international severance costs 
of the total net charge for the year ended december  of million  the cash component included employee severance costs of million  contract termination fees of million and facility closure costs of million 
the non cash component of this charge included million of impairment to the carrying value of equipment and leasehold improvements and million of impairment to prepaid expenses and other current assets 
as of december   the accrued but unpaid amount of these restructuring costs was million 
in september  the company reached a decision to consolidate its manufacturing operations and eliminate approximately of its workforce 
as a result of this decision  the company recognized a restructuring charge of million  or per share diluted in the quarter ended september  additionally  the company recognized restructuring charges of million  or per share diluted in the quarter ended december   primarily related to employee severance costs of million from additional personnel actions and higher fixed asset disposal costs of million  partially offset by revised facility closure and other cost estimates of million 
of the full year charge of million  non cash components included a million impairment charge for intangible assets related to the company s xls reduction product platform acquired in and a million impairment charge for fixed assets disposed of in conjunction with the consolidation of manufacturing facilities 
the cash components of this charge included million for estimated expenditures related to the closure of facilities  million for employee severance costs and million of other restructuring costs 
as of december   the amount of restructuring costs accrued but unpaid was million 
shutdown of operations during the quarter ended june   the company shut down the operations of its ultrabeam unit 
as a direct result of this decision  the company recognized a charge in the quarter ended june  of million  or per share diluted 
during the quarter ended september   the company recognized an additional charge of million  or per share diluted primarily attributed to revised estimates of amounts to be realized upon the disposition of operating assets 
of the full year charge of million  approximately million related to the disposition of operating and capital assets  million related to termination benefits associated with the termination of employees  million related to facilities and other non employee amounts paid for shutdown and million related to other liabilities 
there were no significant revisions to the original termination provisions established by the company 
at december   there were no outstanding payables or accruals associated with this charge 
gain on sale of land in september  the company exercised an option it held to purchase acres of undeveloped land it leased in san jose  california and sold this property to a third party 
this transaction resulted in a net gain of million  or per share diluted  before related income taxes 
in conjunction with this transaction  the company had collateralized a loan payable by the former owner to a third party with securities valued at million 
upon completion of this transaction  the restriction on these securities was removed 
interest and other income  net interest and other income  net  which consists primarily of interest income  was million for the year ended december   as compared with million for and million for interest and other income  net  for the three month period ended december   included approximately million of interest income related to an income tax refund received during the period 
the decrease  relative to  was primarily attributable to lower interest rates on the company s investments and lower average invested balances 
the increase in interest and other income  net  in  relative to levels achieved in  was primarily related to interest income from higher invested balances  partially offset by lower interest rates 
the company presently maintains an investment portfolio with a weighted average maturity of less than one year 
consequently  changes in short term interest rates have a major impact on the company s interest income 
future changes are expected to have a similar impact 
the company presently expects that interest and other income  net  for the three month period ending march   will be significantly lower than levels achieved in the comparable period in  primarily as a result of lower interest rates and lower invested balances 
income tax expense for the year ended december   the company recorded a benefit income tax provision of million 
the benefit provision relates to resolution of the company s irs audit for the years through and a carry back of losses to recover prior years federal alternative minimum taxes of million 
the ability to recover the prior years alternative minimum taxes is due to a recent us federal law change  allowing for the recovery of these amounts 
in conjunction with the carry back of losses to recover prior years federal alternative minimum taxes  the company has recorded income taxes receivable of million as of december  the company recognized income taxes of million during the year ended december   related primarily to foreign tax requirements 
there was no income tax benefit recognized on the company s pre tax losses in and  due to uncertainty related to the utilization of its net operating loss carry forward 
the company recognized income taxes of million during this provision for consists primarily of foreign withholding taxes  as well as state and federal minimum taxes 
the company presently anticipates that it will recognize income tax expense in  primarily as a result of foreign income taxes 
however  the company believes that the tax rate in will be substantially less than the statutory rate  primarily as a result of available federal net operating loss carry forwards 
income taxes can be affected by estimates of whether  and within which jurisdictions  future earnings will occur and how and when cash is repatriated to the united states  combined with other aspects of an overall income tax strategy 
additionally  taxing jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with the company s tax treatment of certain items  and some historical transactions have income tax effects going forward 
accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using current laws  rules and regulations  each of which can change at any time and in an unpredictable manner 
the company believes it has adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters  and it does not anticipate any material earnings impact from their ultimate resolutions 
liquidity and capital resources net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december   as compared with million during the year ended december  cash used in operating activities in was primarily attributable to the company s net loss of million and a net change in operating assets and liabilities of million  partially offset by non cash charges to income of million 
included in both the net loss and non cash charges to income for the year ended december  is million relating to the write off of inventories  resulting from worsening conditions in the semiconductor industry and the discontinuance of certain of the company s product platforms  and million of impairment charges for fixed assets pursuant to the company s restructure of operations in september the million net change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily a result of a decline in deferred license income of million  an increase in inventories of million  a decline of million in income taxes payable and a decline in accounts payable of million  partially offset by an increase in deferred rent of million and an increase in deferred product and services income of million 
the company believes that because of the relatively long manufacturing cycle of certain of its systems  particularly newer products  the company s inventories will continue to represent a significant portion of working capital 
currently  the company is devoting significant resources to the development  introduction and commercialization of its verdant laser thermal processing system and to the volume production of its saturn spectrum e and mm wafer steppers 
the company currently intends to continue to develop these products and technologies during the remainder of  and will continue to incur significant operating expenses in the areas of research  development and engineering  manufacturing and general and administrative costs in order to further develop  produce and support these new products 
additionally  gross profit margins  inventory and capital equipment levels may be further adversely impacted in the future by costs associated with the initial production of these new product lines 
these costs include  but are not limited to  additional manufacturing overhead  costs of demonstration systems and facilities  costs associated with managing multiple sites and the establishment of additional after sales support organizations 
additionally  there can be no assurance that operating expenses will not increase  relative to sales  as a result of adding additional marketing and administrative personnel  among other costs  to support the company s new products 
if the company is unable to achieve significantly increased net sales or if its sales fall below expectations  the company s cash flow and operating results will be materially adversely affected until  among other factors  costs and expenses can be reduced 
the failure of the company to achieve its sales targets for these new products could result in additional inventory write offs and asset impairment charges  either of which could materially adversely impact the company s results of operations 
the semiconductor and nanotechnology industries have been and are presently experiencing a severe downturn due  in part  to macro economic conditions facing the us and world economies 
as a result  the company has experienced significantly lower order rates for its systems and this trend may continue in the near term 
prolonged weakness in the company s business would continue to place the company s inventories at a greater risk of obsolescence 
lower demand for the company s systems may continue to lead to additional inventory write offs and purchase commitment reserves  which would materially adversely impact the company s results of operations 
additionally  worsening business conditions increase the likelihood of further restructuring of operations and impairments to the company s assets  either of which would have a material adverse impact on results of operations 
during the year ended december   net cash used in investing activities was million  attributable to a net increase in available for sale securities of million and capital expenditures of million 
cash generated by financing activities was million during the year ended december   attributable to net borrowings of million and million in proceeds received from the issuance of common stock under the company s stock option plans and its employee stock purchase plans 
at december   the company had working capital of million 
the company s principal source of liquidity at december  consisted of million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments
