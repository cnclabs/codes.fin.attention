critical accounting policies in preparing the financial statements  we follow accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which in many cases require us to make assumptions  estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported 
many of these policies are relatively straightforward 
there are  however  a few policies that are critical because they are important in determining the financial condition and results of operations and they can be difficult to apply 
we believe that the most critical accounting policies applied in the preparation of our financial statements relate to a accounting for contingencies  under which we accrue a loss when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably measured  and b measuring long term assets for impairment 
the difficulty in applying these policies arises from the assumptions  estimates and judgments that have to be made currently about matters that are inherently uncertain  such as future economic conditions  operating results and valuations as well as management intentions 
as the difficulty increases  the level of precision decreases  meaning that actual results can and probably will be different from those currently estimated 
we base our assumptions  estimates and judgments on a combination of historical experience and other reasonable factors
