item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition the following discussion and analysis provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes 
overview knape vogt is a leading manufacturer of functional hardware  storage related components and ergonomic products with a long history dating back to we complement our manufacturing capabilities with our design and distribution expertise 
in fiscal  we realigned our business to allow more focus on our two key segments  office products and home and commercial products 
our office products segment develops  markets and distributes its hardware and idea work brand of ergonomic products primarily to office furniture oems and office furniture dealers 
our home and commercial products segment develops  markets and distributes hardware  kitchen and storage solutions primarily to retailers  specialty distributors and kitchen oems 
these products include the real solutions for real life brand of storage products 
critical accounting policies this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions and factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
based on our ongoing review  we will make adjustments  as we consider appropriate under the current facts and circumstances 
we believe that the following represent the more critical estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our consolidated statements 
revenue recognition we record revenue when title to the product and risk of ownership passes to the buyer 
sales are shown net of returns  discounts and any other form of sales incentive  including cooperative advertising and rebates 
allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable we record allowances for losses that we may incur from the inability of certain of our customers to pay for products or services that they have purchased 
in determining these allowances  we take into consideration the financial condition of our customers  previous payment history and the age of the outstanding balances 
we monitor our customers balances on a monthly basis and assess the adequacy of the allowances recorded 
inventory reserves we provide reserves for inventory that we consider obsolete or slow moving  utilizing assumptions about future demand for our products 
we monitor our inventory by type  age and usage on a monthly basis to determine the reserves recorded 
impairment of long lived assets we periodically review the carrying value of our long lived assets held and used  including goodwill and other intangible assets 
this review is performed using estimated future cash flows 
if the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered to be impaired  an impairment charge is recorded for the amount that the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
pension and other postretirement benefits accounting for defined benefit pension plans involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided in the future  based on vested years of service  and attributing those costs over the time period each employee works 
the most significant factor affecting our pension costs is the fair value of the plan assets and the selection of key assumptions  including the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets 
in fiscal  we reduced our discount rate to from 
we also lowered our expected return on plan assets to from 
while we believe the assumptions selected are reasonable  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension obligations and our future expense 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for our employee retirement plans 
results of operations the table below shows certain items in our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net sales year ended june  june  june  net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses other 


operating income other expense 
income before income taxes income taxes 
net income sales the table below summarizes our sales by division for the past three fiscal years in millions year ended june  june  june  office products home and commercial products total net sales consolidated net sales for fiscal declined compared to fiscal  which followed a decline of when comparing fiscal to fiscal our office products division sales decreased when compared to fiscal  following a decline of in fiscal when compared to fiscal the office furniture industry shipments  as a whole  have continued to decline as seen in the business and institutional furniture manufacturers association bifma results for fiscal and fiscal  which showed decreases of and  respectively 
despite the downturn in this industry  we have been able to maintain relatively stable sales to the office furniture channel with our idea work product line 
we attribute our ability to outperform the market in this channel  to sales of our new products  including the keynetix adjustable keyboard  the mantis flat screen monitor arm and the captor cpu holder 
during june  at the neocon show in chicago  we launched our line of height adjustable tables  proliftix  and have begun taking orders for this line  which will begin shipping in early fiscal our home and commercial products division fiscal sales decreased by when compared to fiscal during the first quarter of fiscal  we launched a consignment inventory program for certain customers within this division 
the program has expanded during the year and the consignment inventory balance at june  was million at cost 
the launch of this program effectively deferred sales from fiscal  however  we have seen sales increase during the fiscal year to those customers participating in the program 
we have also been successful in placing several of our new products into the retail channel  including our new line of shelf made instant shelves  our real solutions for real life line of kitchen and bath accessories and our work ease line of ergonomic products 
the only channel  which has consistently reported sales declines during fiscal  was the kitchen and bath oem channel 
near the end of the third quarter  we realigned our sales force to better target this market 
the decrease in our home and commercial products division sales in fiscal when compared to fiscal reflected the overall downturn in the us economy 
new product sales those products introduced within the last months were approximately million in fiscal and million in fiscal new product introductions  along with value added services  such as vendor managed inventory  remain a key component of our strategy 
gross profit gross profit  as a percentage of net sales  was in fiscal  compared to in fiscal and in fiscal overall  we have a significant investment in our manufacturing process  specifically machinery and tooling 
with the decrease in sales volumes during the past two fiscal years  it has been more difficult to effectively leverage the fixed portion of these costs 
in addition  we have seen significant increases in our raw steel costs  ranging from to depending on the grade of steel  as a result of the steel tariffs imposed during fiscal we have been partially successful in offsetting the impact of the sales volume decline and the raw material price increases by utilizing lean manufacturing initiatives to minimize manufacturing costs  along with identifying competitive alternative sourcing options  when applicable  and by increasing sales of higher margin products such as the line of ergonomic products and higher sales into our more profitable market channels 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percent of net sales  were in fiscal  compared to in fiscal and in fiscal during the second quarter of fiscal  we recognized a pre tax gain of million due to the successful resolution of certain legal matters 
excluding this gain  selling and administrative expenses would have been of net sales in fiscal the increase from the prior year was due in part to the higher selling costs associated with the ergonomic product line combined with the advertising and marketing costs we incurred to launch new products in both of our divisions 
during the past two fiscal years  we have also incurred costs to reintroduce our line of kitchen and bath accessories under the real solutions for real life logo 
finally during fiscal  we made significant investments in our selling efforts to the distribution channel in an effort to aggressively grow sales in this key market 
restructuring impairment during the first quarter of fiscal  we recorded  pre tax of severance costs  primarily related to the resignation of two of our executive officers in august in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a pre tax impairment charge of  in accordance with financial accounting standard no 
for certain precision drawer slide tooling 
while we continue to produce the drawer slides  the future cash flows associated with the sales of this particular product line were less than the cost of the tooling recorded 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we adopted a plan to reduce our salaried workforce in the grand rapids  michigan facility 
we recorded  in severance costs for this workforce reduction 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded a pre tax impairment loss on assets held for sale of 
million 
the loss reflected new information  which lowered our estimate of the fair market value of the properties listed for sale 
in fiscal  we had recorded a loss of 
million pre tax  which was our best estimate at that time of the loss to be incurred on the sale of our former powder coat facility 
the assets held for sale were sold during fiscal at no additional loss 
interest expense and income taxes interest expense was million in fiscal  compared to million and million  respectively  in fiscal years and overall  interest expense has remained relatively stable over the past three fiscal years 
slight variations reflect the impact of higher or lower balances outstanding on the revolving credit facility 
during fiscal  we amended our income tax returns previously filed for fiscal years and a change in the federal tax law allowed us to utilize a portion of our capital loss from fiscal that had been previously disallowed 
as a result of this change  we recognized an income tax benefit of  in fiscal excluding the impact of the amended returns  the effective tax rate would have been in fiscal  compared to in fiscal and in fiscal overall  rates have increased due to the ratio of foreign versus domestic income and expanded state exposure 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of the effective tax rate 
net income net income was million  or per diluted share  in fiscal compared to million  or per diluted share  in fiscal and million  or per diluted share in fiscal the declines in both fiscal and fiscal were primarily due to the decrease in overall sales volume 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows from operating activities generated 
million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the lower cash flow from operating activities in fiscal reflects lower earnings  a significant contribution to our defined benefit pension plans  combined with higher inventory levels needed to support the launch of the new products and the consignment inventory program 
in addition  the payment of the legal settlements during fiscal also reduced the cash generated by operating activities 
the increase in fiscal represented an improvement in the change in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities when compared to the prior year 
cash flows used in investing activities were million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal we spent million on capital expenditures in fiscal  compared to million and million  respectively  in fiscal and the fiscal capital expenditures represented investments in tooling for new products  including the hopper and certain precision drawer slides  along with investment in our web based customer service application and our new office showroom 
capital spending has declined in fiscal and  due to the fact that we believe that our investments made in earlier years in the manufacturing process have been sufficient to meet the anticipated capacity needs for at least the next three to five years 
we believe that capital expenditures will approximate million in fiscal  as investments will be focused on bringing new products and product enhancements to our customers 
the cost to complete the items classified as construction in progress at june  was estimated to be approximately  which will be derived from cash flows from operations or from the revolving credit facility 
investing activities in fiscal also included the net cash paid for the acquisition of idea industries  inc idea 
on october   we acquired substantially all of the assets of idea 
idea designed  manufactured and marketed ergonomic products  including adjustable keyboard mechanisms  keyboard and computer mouse platforms  wrist rests and cpu holders 
the acquisition was recorded using the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed  based on their estimated fair values at the date of the acquisition 
the cost of the acquisition in excess of net identifiable assets acquired  including contingent consideration paid in fiscals and  was recorded as goodwill and has been amortized using the straight line method based on a year life 
we discontinued the amortization of goodwill in fiscal  when we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
see the discussion in note 
cash flows generated from financing activities were million in fiscal  compared to million of cash flow used in fiscal and 
million generated in fiscal the generation of funds in fiscal reflects borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
the use of funds in fiscal reflects the repayment of million of debt under the revolving credit facility along with the repurchase of million of our common stock 
we have a stock repurchase program  under which we purchased  shares during fiscal with the price per share ranging from approximately to at june   we are authorized to repurchase an additional  shares 
we have a revolving credit agreement that provides for borrowings up to million and expires on november  in addition  we have an interest rate swap agreement  which expires on june   in order to fix the interest rate on million of borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
the swap agreement fixed the rate at plus our credit spread on the revolving credit agreement 
at june   we were in compliance with all of the covenants of the revolving credit agreement 
our outstanding debt at june  was million  compared to million at fiscal year end 
the debt to total capital ratio increased to at june   from at june  note that we define total capital as the sum of long term debt plus total stockholders equity 
we continue to manage our debt levels in an effort to maintain our debt to total capital in a range of to 
we believe that cash flows from operations and funds available under the credit facility will be sufficient to fund working capital requirements  stock repurchases and capital expenditures in fiscal on august   the company s board of directors approved a resolution to refinance our revolving bank loan with a new lending institution 
a commitment has been signed with the lender 
the agreement calls for a million unsecured revolving credit facility including a million sub limit for letters of credit and matures on november  interest on the revolving credit facility will be payable at prime or libor rates plus a spread of up to 
or  respectively  based upon certain ratios 
legal contingencies during the second quarter of fiscal  the company settled a claim for  related to a lease of which the company was a guarantor 
the claim had been previously accrued on the balance sheet 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we settled certain legal concerns involving potential royalty issues for which an accrual had been previously recorded 
as a result  we reported a pre tax gain of approximately  as an offset to selling and administrative expenses in the statement of income 
the canada customs and revenue agency ccra has performed an audit of our sales to our wholly owned subsidiary  knape vogt canada 
preliminary results from a joint review by kv and our customs broker indicate that we may be liable for certain customs duties  however  the amount of any such potential liability is unknown at this time 
we are defending our position that knape vogt canada is the importer of record for all knape vogt goods shipped into canada and we believe  that based on the information available at this time  any liability owed to the ccra will not have a material adverse effect on our earnings 
we were sued in the kent county  michigan circuit court in by a former employee seeking additional benefits under an executive retirement plan 
the circuit court ruled in favor of the plaintiff  but in june  the circuit court was reversed on our appeal to the michigan court of appeals 
the plaintiff filed a delayed request for leave to appeal to the michigan supreme court 
in august  the plaintiff filed a lawsuit seeking these retirement benefits in the federal district court for the western district of michigan 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the plaintiff s request for leave to appeal to the michigan supreme court was denied 
the company has moved to dismiss the federal litigation based on the statute of limitations 
the federal district judge has taken this motion under advisement 
we are also subject to other legal proceedings and claims  which arise in the ordinary course of business 
in the opinion of management  based on the information presently known and taking into account established accruals of approximately  at june   the ultimate liability for these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or the results of our operations 
contractual obligations as more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we are obligated to make future payments under certain debt and lease agreements  and are a party to other commitments 
the following table summarizes these obligations as of june  payments due by period total less than year years years long term debt   capital lease     operating leases    purchase obligations   total contractual cash obligations     in addition  we are a party to certain other agreements that contractually and unconditionally commit us to pay certain amounts in the future 
while we believe it is probable that amounts will be spent in the future under such contracts  the amount and or the timing of such future payments will vary depending on certain provisions of the applicable contract 
the agreements to which we are a party that fall into this category include certain royalty agreements under which we pay a royalty based on the sales volume of certain products that we manufacture and sell 
inflation inflation has not had a significant effect on kv over the past three years  nor is it expected to have a significant effect in the foreseeable future 
we continuously attempt to minimize the effect of inflation through cost reductions and improved productivity
