in this discussion  camd  we  us and our refer to california micro devices corporation 
all trademarks appearing in this report are the property of their respective owners 
in the following discussion  fiscal   and refer to the year ended march    and  respectively 
overview california micro devices corporation designs and markets application specific integrated passive devices and complementary analog semiconductors for the mobile  computing  lighting  medical and other markets 
our products provide signal integrity  electromagnetic interference filtering  electrostatic discharge protection  and power management solutions to original equipment manufacturers and contract manufacturers 
through proprietary manufacturing processes  we integrate multiple passive components onto single chips and enhance their functionality with discrete semiconductor functions 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we initiated a program to streamline our manufacturing operations and focus our business on high volume products and in markets that we have  or believe we can achieve  a leadership position while leveraging our core technology strengths 
key parts of this strategy include the plan to outsource a significant portion of our wafer manufacturing to independent foundries and to discontinue certain older products 
during fiscal  we completed the program 
in connection with outsourcing a significant portion of our wafer manufacturing  we have consolidated all of our internal wafer fabrication and our internal chip scale packaging activities into our tempe  arizona facility 
in connection with these actions we recorded restructuring and asset impairment charges of million in the year ended march   which is reflected in operating expenses as special charges 
during fiscal  we determined that our actual costs to implement the program would be million less than our original estimate 
therefore  we recorded a reduction in operating expenses in the third quarter of fiscal as special charges 
the restructuring program included a workforce reduction and lease termination costs 
results of operations net sales 
net sales for fiscal were million compared to net sales for fiscal of million  an increase of million  or 
the largest component of this increase was in the mobile market followed by higher sales in the computing and medical markets 
net sales in the mobile market  computing and medical markets increased to million  million and million in fiscal from approximately million  million  and million respectively in fiscal sales in the lighting market increased slightly to million in fiscal from million in fiscal while net sales in our communications  legacy and mature products in total decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal we had expected a decrease in our communications  legacy and mature products as we have notified our customers that we will no longer support many of these products 
the customers for the affected products have been provided with end of life purchase opportunities 
units shipped during fiscal increased to approximately million units from million in fiscal our increased revenue resulted primarily from larger unit sales  which resulted in part from increased sales of current products and in part from sales of newly introduced products 
our average unit price dropped by approximately during fiscal versus fiscal which was predominately the result of faster growth in our lower price products and to a lesser extent to price decreases 
net sales for fiscal were million as compared to net sales in fiscal of million  a decrease of million  or 
the majority of the decrease was in the communications infrastructure and computing markets which were adversely effected by the technology recession 
these had been our largest markets 
units shipped decreased in fiscal compared to the year earlier 
cost of sales 
cost of sales in fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal cost of sales decreased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal while the level of net sales increased by million 
cost of sales has been impacted by three elements  which are the charges related to our end of life eol or obsolete program  benefits of selling previously reserved material  and the costs of producing the products 
during fiscal  we initiated a plan to focus our business on high volume products and in markets where we believe we can achieve a leadership position 
we concluded that it was not economical to continue the manufacturing of many of our smaller and older product lines 
as part of this process  we designated many of these products as eol or obsolete during fiscal the last phase of eol or obsolete product designation  for the current program  occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal based on our forecast of future demand and historical sales rates  and recognizing that minimal sales and marketing resources would be applied both internally and by our distributors for products so designated  much of the existing internal inventory for these legacy products was deemed to be excess or obsolete and accordingly was reserved  as well as the cost related to the inventory held by certain of our distributors 
during fiscal  we incurred charges of million related to reserving discontinued inventory on hand and at distributors 
during fiscal  we incurred charges of million related to reserving eol and obsolete inventory 
we intend to scrap inventory designated as eol or obsolete that remains after last buy opportunities have expired 
during fiscal and cost of sales included a benefit associated with the sale of fully reserved inventory for which reserves of approximately million and million had been established in prior periods 
there are a large number of older products which are purchased on an irregular basis from a broad number of customers which makes it difficult to accurately predict specific demand for these products when establishing excess and obsolete reserve requirements 
cost of sales  excluding the impact of our end of life and obsolete product reserves and the benefits of selling previously reserved material  was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal for an increase of million 
the small increase in cost of sales  excluding these items  relative to the increase in net sales of million is the result of streamlining our internal manufacturing operations and our fab lite manufacturing strategy 
the impact of our strategy is expected to be positive in the future but we do not expect the impact to be as significant as we experienced in fiscal with the initial restructuring and transfers 
the decrease in cost of sales from fiscal to fiscal was in part the result of decreased manufacturing efficiencies and lower production volumes as sales decreased in offset by the impact of our end of life and obsolete product reserves described above 
our strategy is to outsource the majority of our wafer fabrication except for those products which do not have commercial foundry processes available 
after the completion of the end of life buys in fiscal  we will be fabricating primarily medical product wafers in our tempe  arizona facility 
even after consolidating our internal manufacturing operations  we expect to continue to operate at less than full capacity even if and when our net sales increase because we would choose to meet the bulk of the increased demand with products manufactured at one or more of our third party foundries 
capacity variances related to the under utilization are expensed to cost of sales in the period incurred 
gross margin 
gross margin is comprised of net sales less costs of sales 
gross margin was million in fiscal  a gross margin loss of million in fiscal and gross margin of million in fiscal gross margin  as a percentage of revenues  was a positive in fiscal compared to a negative in fiscal and a positive in fiscal the gross margin dollar and percentage increase in fiscal compared to fiscal was in part the result of increased revenue  consolidating our internal manufacturing operations  our fab subcontractor strategy and the reduction in inventory charges related to our end of life eol or obsolete program as described above in cost of sales 
the decrease in gross margin from fiscal to fiscal was in part the result of decreased manufacturing efficiencies on lower production volumes as sales decreased in and also the impact of our end of life and obsolete product reserves 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for employees  prototypes  masks  and other expenses for the development of process technology  new packages and products 
research and development expenses were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in research and development costs from fiscal to fiscal was primarily associated with our new design center in austin  texas 
our research and development expenses in fiscal were of net sales compared to in fiscal and in fiscal the percentage was higher in fiscal as the company continued to invest in new products while the net sales level declined 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for employees  sales commissions  marketing and promotional expenses  and legal and other professional fees 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal the decrease in fiscal over fiscal was primarily the result of lower compensation related expenses 
the increase in fiscal over fiscal was the result of higher legal and professional fees  almost entirely offset by lower compensation and sales commissions on lower revenues 
even though our revenue increased substantially in fiscal  thereby increasing our sales commissions  we were able to reduce our overall selling  general  and administrative expenses by in fiscal as a result  our selling  general  and administrative expenses were reduced from of net sales in fiscal to in fiscal while these expenses were in fiscal on a higher level of net sales 
special charges 
during fiscal  we completed our restructuring program  which was initiated during fiscal the cost to implement the program was slightly less than originally projected and as a result we recognized a benefit related to the reversal of the remaining liability of million during fiscal during fiscal  we recorded restructuring and asset impairment charges of million related to our decision to outsource a significant portion of our wafer manufacturing 
in connection with this decision  we have consolidated all of our internal wafer fabrication activities and our internal chip scale packaging activities into our tempe  arizona facility 
the million of special charges in fiscal consisted of expenses related to a workforce reduction  write down of certain manufacturing equipment and lease termination costs 
a rollforward of the restructuring and asset impairment charges incurred during the year ended march  through march  is as follows in thousands total charge march  non cash charges cash payments march  restructuring liability at march  cash payments reversal of amounts related to restructuring restructuring liability at march  workforce reduction impairment of equipment facilities and other total workforce reduction in connection with the restructuring program  we reduced our headcount by approximately employees  primarily in the manufacturing functions and primarily located at our milpitas  california facility 
the estimated workforce reduction resulted in a  charge in fiscal year relating to severance and fringe benefits of which  was reversed in fiscal all employees affected by the workforce reduction were informed of the plan in enough detail so that they could determine their type and amount of severance benefit in fiscal year approximately employees had been terminated as of march   with their severance and benefits paid in april  the remaining employees were terminated in fiscal as of march   there are no payments remaining under this program 
impairment of equipment as part of our restructuring program  we have outsourced a significant portion of our wafer fabrication activities and have consolidated our internal wafer fabrication activities into our tempe  arizona facility 
with the outsourcing of a significant portion of our wafer fabrication activities  the number and volume of products generated from the equipment located at our tempe facility have been significantly reduced 
as a result of these circumstances  we performed an analysis to determine if the manufacturing equipment at our tempe  arizona facility was impaired 
based on the analysis performed  which was based on our estimates of future undiscounted cash flows  we determined that these assets were impaired and wrote down the value of the assets to their estimated fair value  resulting in a charge of million in fiscal fair value was estimated as the amount for which the assets could be purchased in an arms length transaction based on an independent appraisal 
we did not have any impairment charges in fiscal facilities and other during fiscal we closed our milpitas facility and outsourced other requirements to our foundry partner 
as required by the lease for the milpitas facility  we were obligated to restore the milpitas facility to its pre lease condition 
accordingly  we recorded million in estimated renovation costs related to the milpitas facility in fiscal of the total restructuring liability pertaining to facilities   was reversed in fiscal the expected annual cash savings anticipated from the restructuring plan relates primarily to savings in employee compensation and facilities costs 
these savings have been offset in part by the prices we now pay for wafers to our foundry partner for products transferred to asmc and also by the increased costs of personnel in tempe to manufacture products transferred from milpitas to tempe 
as a result  the net cash savings to date resulting directly from the restructuring plan have not been significant 
interest expense interest expense was million  million  and million in fiscal   and respectively 
the increase in interest expense from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to an increase in our borrowings against our equipment line of credit  used to finance a portion of our capital expenditures  to refinance prior borrowings under the comerica credit line and to a lesser extent the use of our revolving credit line during the year 
the decrease in interest expense from fiscal to is primarily due to the expiration of capital leases in fiscal interest income and other income expense  net 
interest income and other income expense  net was  in fiscal   in fiscal  and  in fiscal interest income decreased to  due to lower average cash balances and lower interest rates and was offset by other expense of  the decrease in fiscal from fiscal is primarily the result of lower interest income on lower average investment balances  offset in part by lower other expenses in fiscal fiscal also included a  charge related to the write off of costs associated with a cancelled public offering of our common stock 
income taxes 
in fiscal and  there was no provision for income taxes due to the net loss incurred for the period 
in fiscal  we recorded a federal and state alternative minimum tax provision of  after taking into consideration the use of net operating loss carryforwards 
we have provided a valuation allowance against total deferred tax assets due to the uncertainties surrounding our ability to generate sufficient taxable income in future periods to realize the tax benefits of the carry forwards 
see note of notes to financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which addresses accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we do not expect that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred  rather than when the exit or disposal plan is approved 
sfas no 
nullifies eitf issue no 
 and had to be applied beginning january  the adoption of sfas no 
has not had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  or fin fin will significantly change current practice in the accounting for and disclosure of guarantees 
fin requires certain guarantees to be recorded at fair value  which is different from the current practice of recording a liability only when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable  as those terms are defined in sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
fin also requires a guarantor to make significant new disclosures  even when the likelihood of making any payments under the guarantee is remote  which is another change from the current practice 
fin disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december   while the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
sfas no 
also requires that disclosures of the pro forma effect of using the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation be displayed more prominently and in a tabular format 
additionally  sfas no 
requires disclosure of the pro forma effect in interim financial statements 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after december  the adoption of sfas no 
has not had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 or fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin requires an investor with a majority of the variable interests in a variable interest entity to consolidate the entity and also requires majority and significant variable interest investors to provide certain disclosures 
the company does not have any investments in variable interest entities and therefore the adoption of the provisions of fin did not have a material impact on its results of operations and financial position in critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and all known facts and circumstances that we believe are relevant 
actual results may differ materially from our estimates 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of notes to financial statements 
the significant accounting policies that we believe are critical  either because they relate to financial line items that are key indicators of our financial performance eg  revenue and or because their application requires significant management judgment  are described in the following paragraphs 
management has discussed the development of our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors and they have reviewed the disclosures of such estimates in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policy is described in note of notes to financial statements 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery or customer acceptance  where applicable  has occurred  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
revenue from product sales to end user customers  or to distributors that do not receive price concessions and do not have return rights  is recognized upon title transfer and shipment  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
reserves for sales returns and allowances from end user customers are estimated primarily based on historical experience and are provided for at the time of shipment 
revenue from product shipments to distributors with agreements allowing for either price concessions or for product returns is recognized at the time the distributor sells the product to oems or other end users at which time the sales price becomes fixed 
revenue is not recognized upon initial shipment to the distributors since  due to various forms of price concessions  the sales price is not substantially fixed or determinable at that time 
additionally  these distributors have contractual rights to return products  up to a specified amount for a given period of time 
pursuant to our agreements with our distributors  custom  older or end of life products are sold with no right of return and are not eligible for price concessions 
in these cases  revenue is recognized upon shipment to the distributor assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
at the time of shipment to distributors  we defer our gross selling price of the product shipped and the related cost of the product shipped and reflect such net amounts on our balance sheet as a current liability entitled deferred margin on shipments to distributors 
thus  deferred margin on shipments to distributors represents the margin on the products we ship to distributors  or the difference between our revenue and cost of the product for inventory held by the distributors at the end of the accounting period 
the aspect of our revenue recognition policy that involves significant judgment and estimates is the following collection is reasonably assured we assess the probability of collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history and or the creditworthiness of the customer 
if we determine that collection of a receivable is not probable  we defer recognition of revenue until the collection becomes probable  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
inventory and related reserves our inventory and related reserves policy is described in note of notes to financial statements 
the aspects of our inventory and related reserves policy that involve more significant judgments and estimates include the following forecast of customer demand we provide reserves for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based on a comparison of quantity and cost of inventory on hand to management s forecast of customer demand for the next months 
in forecasting customer demand  we make estimates as to  among other things  the timing of sales  the mix of products sold to customers  the timing of design wins and related volume purchases by new and existing customers  and the timing of existing customers transition to new products 
because a significant portion of our sales are through distributors and many parts may have small sales volume  the customer demand forecast process is not inclusive of all parts 
therefore  historical trends may also be used in estimating the excess and obsolete inventory reserves 
we review our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory on a quarterly basis considering all known facts and circumstances and adjust our forecast of customer demand accordingly 
once a reserve is established  it is maintained until the product to which it relates is sold or otherwise disposed of 
in fiscal  we recognized a benefit of approximately million relating to the sale or consumption of inventory that had been previously reserved 
to the extent that our forecast of customer demand materially differs from actual demand  our estimates used in determining cost of sales and gross margin could be positively or negatively impacted 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets held and used by us are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recognized if the sum of the expected undiscounted cash flows from the use of the asset is less than the carrying value of the asset 
the amount of impairment loss will be measured as the difference between the carrying value of the assets and their estimated fair value 
in fiscal  we determined that the carrying value of certain of our owned manufacturing equipment was no longer recoverable based on estimates of future cash flows 
our estimate of the future cash flows generated from this equipment decreased significantly in due to the completion of our plan to outsource a significant portion of our wafer fabrication activities to an independent foundry 
as a result  we recognized an impairment charge of approximately million in the second quarter of estimates of future cash flows used to test the asset for recoverability were based on current operating projections extended to the useful life of the asset group 
we have estimated the fair value of the equipment based on a market prices for purchases of similar equipment 
if the estimate of the cash flows were to increase by the assets would still not be recoverable 
litigation we are a party to lawsuits  claims  investigations  and proceedings  including commercial and employment matters  which are being handled and defended in the ordinary course of business 
we review the current status of any pending or threatened proceedings with our outside counsel on a regular basis and  considering all the other known relevant facts and circumstances  recognize any loss that we consider probable and estimable as of the balance sheet date 
as of march   and march   we had not recorded any significant liability on our balance sheet for any pending or threatened litigation  claims  or proceedings 
we have two cases pending in the santa clara county  state of california superior court in which the upper range of amounts sought by the plaintiffs has been estimated by the company to be between five and ten million dollars when intangible items are quantified and therefore a verdict in their favor would be materially adverse to our business 
although several years old  both cases have been stayed by courts until fairly recently  as a result  both cases are early in the discovery phase  making it difficult to assess the probability of the opposing parties or ourselves prevailing with a significant degree of confidence 
the first case involves counterclaims brought by our former ceo  chan desaigoudar on august   after we sued him on may   for fraud and breach of fiduciary duty 
the counterclaims are for  among other items  wrongful termination and improper termination of his stock option 
the second case involves a former employee  tarsaim l 
batra  who has sued the company and three of our former officers  mr 
desaigoudar  steve henke and surendra gupta  on september   and april   in two cases which have been consolidated  likewise for wrongful termination of his employment and for deprivation of his stock options 
the us government in the past has prosecuted messrs 
desaigoudar  henke  and gupta for criminal securities law violations 
mr 
gupta plead guilty before trial while messrs 
desaigoudar and henke were convicted  however  their convictions were overturned and a retrial was imminent when in may  they each entered a guilty plea as to one or more of the counts 
we believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims of the opposing parties in both of these cases 
currently  we intend to vigorously pursue our defenses and or our claims against the opposing parties in these matters 
should we unexpectedly learn facts during discovery which lead us to reasonably estimate a negative outcome to these cases  or should one or both of these cases result in a verdict or settlement for the other parties  then we will provide for such liability  as appropriate 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our operations through a combination of debt and equity financing and cash generated from operations 
total cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as of march  were million  as compared to million at march  receivables increased to million at march  compared to million a year earlier  primarily as a result of higher sales 
receivables days sales outstanding were days at march  as compared to days at march  inventories increased from million at march  to million at march   in part due to an increase in finished goods inventory in response to the increased sales activity 
capital expenditures totaled million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal reflecting our continued investment in new equipment to support our production of chip scale products 
operating activities used million of cash in fiscal the most significant usage of cash was our net loss before non cash charges of million 
increases in receivables  deferred margin on shipment to distributors  and inventories and decreases in accounts payable and other current liabilities used an additional million in cash 
these uses of cash were partially offset by decreases in long term assets and decreases in other long term liabilities  which provided a net additional million of cash 
cash used by operating activities in fiscal of million was primarily due to our net loss before non cash charges of million 
increases in long term assets and decreases in other long term liabilities used an additional million of cash 
these uses of cash were partially offset by decreases in accounts receivable  inventories  prepaid expenses and other current assets and increases in accounts payable and deferred margin on shipments to distributors  which provided million of cash for operations 
we used cash of million for investing activities in fiscal as compared to providing cash of million in fiscal and million used in fiscal cash used in investing activities in fiscal was principally the result of an increase in capital expenditures of million offset by the sale of short term investments of million 
cash provided by investing activities in fiscal was the result of net proceeds from the sale of short term investments of million  partially offset by cash used to purchase capital equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal was million and was primarily the result of proceeds from the sale of our common stock of million 
in fiscal  we sold million shares of our common stock and issued  warrants to purchase shares of our common stock to several institutional investors and certain of our directors for gross proceeds of million  offset by cash offering expenses of  in addition we received million from the issuance of common stock under our employee benefit plans and million from long term borrowings offset by repayments of long term borrowings of million 
net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal was million and was primarily the result of proceeds from the sale of our common stock of million 
in fiscal  we sold  shares of our common stock to several institutional investors and certain of our directors for gross proceeds of million  offset by cash offering expenses of  in addition  we received million from the issuance of common stock under our employee benefits plans and  from long term borrowings 
in june  we entered into a loan and security agreement that allows us to borrow up to a total of million under an equipment line of credit and a revolving line of credit  neither of which can individually exceed million 
the amount available under the agreement is based on the amount of eligible equipment and accounts receivable 
under this agreement  we are subject to certain financial covenants and restrictions and must maintain a compensating balance of cash with the bank of million 
the agreement also contains a subjective acceleration clause  which enables the bank to declare an event of default and call our loan if it determines that there has been a material adverse change in our business or that its security interest has been impaired 
the financial covenants relate to a monthly minimum quick ratio and quarterly tangible net worth 
borrowings under the equipment line and the revolving line bear interest at an annual rate of prime plus and prime plus  respectively 
principal  in equal installments  and interest are due monthly for a term of months for all borrowings made under the equipment line 
borrowings under the revolving credit line have a term of months  with principal due at maturity and interest due in monthly installments 
borrowings under both lines are collateralized by substantially all of our assets 
at march   we had million outstanding under the equipment line  of which million was used to pay off in full borrowings outstanding under our four existing capital equipment financing agreements described below 
future maturities of this debt at march  are million in fiscal  million in fiscal and  in fiscal at march  we have additional funds available under this agreement of approximately million as a line of credit secured by equipment and accounts receivable 
at march   we were in violation of the covenants relating to a minimum monthly quick ratio and tangible net worth 
it is highly possible that we will not be in compliance with certain of our covenants for the first two quarters of fiscal the bank has subsequently provided a waiver to the march  covenants  has modified the future covenants and extended the term of the agreement to july  on june   the bank agreed to further modify the loan agreement such that if we fail in the future to comply with either of the financial covenants defined in the agreement  as amended  the credit facilities will convert to an asset based lending facility 
the borrowing base  as defined within the agreement  must be adequate to support all outstanding obligations with any excess being immediately repaid 
presently  our borrowing base is sufficient to support all outstanding obligations therefore we have continued to classify as long term on our balance sheet all obligations scheduled to be repaid beyond twelve months 
however  there can be no assurance that the borrowing base will remain sufficient and we may be required to repay all or part of our outstanding indebtedness to the bank earlier than scheduled 
during fiscal  we entered into two capital equipment financing facilities aggregating million 
the terms of these facilities allowed us to borrow at prime plus 
during fiscal and  we borrowed the full amounts available under these facilities 
during fiscal  we terminated these facilities and paid off this debt in full with the proceeds received under the loan and security agreement described above 
in july  we secured an additional million equipment financing facility with interest at prime plus 
during fiscal we borrowed  against this million facility 
during fiscal we terminated this facility and paid off this debt in full with the proceeds received under the loan and security agreement described above 
in fiscal  we entered into a credit agreement allowing us to borrow up to  at an annual interest rate of prime plus  collateralized by our equipment and other assets 
in fiscal  we borrowed  against this agreement 
during fiscal we terminated this facility and paid off this debt in full with the proceeds from the loan and security agreement described above 
additionally  as of march  and continuing through march  we were not in compliance with certain covenants related to our industrial revenue bonds 
the financial covenants associated with these bonds are requirements to maintain minimum current and quick ratios  shareholders equity  and debt coverage  and not to exceed maximum ratios of total liability to equity and long term debt to working capital 
as of march  we were not in compliance with the long term debt to working capital ratio covenant  the minimum stockholder equity requirement and the debt coverage ratio covenant 
in accordance with the terms of the industrial revenue bonds  the company has retained a management consulting firm who has prepared a report to the issuer and the trustee making recommendations and establishing a progress schedule over a period not to exceed six successive quarters after the date of issuance of such report  to correct all deficiencies with the covenants 
the report of the management consulting firm was completed and filed with the issuer and the trustee within days of the end of the fourth consecutive quarter in which the company was not in compliance with the requirements set forth in the loan agreement 
by retaining a management consulting firm and submitting the required remediation report  the company has complied with the terms of the industrial revenue bonds 
the report has been accepted by the trustee 
accordingly  we have not reclassified the long term portion of this debt of million  to short term on our balance sheet at march  while no assurance can be given  the goal of our market focus and fab lite manufacturing initiatives is to enhance our revenue and gross margin which together with our continuing tight control over operating expenses  would provide operating results enabling us to become compliant and to maintain compliance with the required covenants 
in the event that the company is not in compliance with the financial covenants within the required six successive quarters ending september  the bonds would become due 
future scheduled maturities of long term debt and sinking fund requirements at march  are million in fiscal  million in fiscal   in fiscal   in fiscal   in fiscal and million thereafter 
we lease certain of our facilities and sales offices under non cancelable operating leases  expiring from fiscal to fiscal in may  we entered into a new facility lease for office and light manufacturing space in milpitas  ca 
future minimum lease payments under these leases are  in fiscal   in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal the company has approximately  of non cancelable purchase commitments to vendors at march  payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total year years years more than years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total operating and capital requirements depend on many factors  including the levels at which we maintain revenue  margins  inventory  accounts receivable and operating expenses 
during we substantially completed implementation of our restructuring program aimed at streamlining our manufacturing operations  bringing our costs more in line with the current revenue levels 
our operating plan for fiscal forecasts revenue growth and profit improvement  due in part to our focused sales and marketing efforts and in part to gross margin improvement and expense reductions resulting from additional streamlining of our internal manufacturing and from our manufacturing outsourcing 
should we achieve that plan  we may require additional equipment financing which we may not be able to obtain on terms we consider reasonable and we may wish to raise additional equity capital to provide us with cash reserves and to fund future growth 
if we do not achieve the operating plan  we will need to further adjust our operations in order to conserve our cash  which will be used to fund operating losses instead of growth 
in such event  we may also need to raise additional equity capital  although such funds may not be available on favorable terms  if at all 
regardless of whether we achieve our operating plan  to the extent that existing cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances are not sufficient to support our activities  we will need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing in order to sustain our operations at the level we desire 
the funds may not be available to us  or if available  we may not be able to obtain them on terms favorable to us 
item a
