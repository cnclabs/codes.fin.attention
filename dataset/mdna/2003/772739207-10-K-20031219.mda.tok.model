item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies our accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require management to make estimates that affect the amounts of revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities reported 
the following are critical accounting matters which are both very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and which require some of management s most subjective and complex judgments 
the accounting for these matters involves the making of estimates based on current facts  circumstances and assumptions which  in management s judgment  could change in a manner that would materially affect management s future estimates with respect to such matters and  accordingly  could cause future reported financial condition and results to differ materially from financial results reported based on management s current estimates 
accounts receivable 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our customers financial condition  our collection experience and any other relevant customer specific credit information 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  it is possible that our credit loss rates could be higher or lower in the future 
inventory 
inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market 
cost includes materials  labor and overhead 
market  with respect to all inventories  is replacement cost or net realizable value 
management frequently reviews inventory to determine the necessity of reserves for excess  obsolete or unsaleable inventory 
these reviews require management to assess customer and market demand 
these estimates may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have overstated or understated the reserve required for excess  obsolete or unsaleable inventory 
impairment of long lived assets and goodwill 
we periodically evaluate fixed assets and goodwill for potential impairment indicators 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on legal factors  market conditions and operational performance 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that assets associated with a particular operation are impaired 
evaluating the impairment also requires us to estimate future operating results and cash flows which also require judgment by management 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
self insurance 
we are self insured for the majority of our group health insurance costs  subject to specific retention levels 
consulting actuaries and administrators assist us in determining our liability for self insured claims 
while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our group health insurance costs 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our income tax exposure 
pension and other post retirement benefits 
the determination of our obligation and expense for pension and other post retirement benefits is dependent on our selection of certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
those assumptions are described in note to the consolidated financial statements and include  among others  the discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets and rates of increase in compensation levels 
during fiscal  the effect of a change in the discount rate would have impacted income before income taxes by approximately million 
in accordance 
table of contents with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore  generally affect our recognized expense  recorded obligation and funding requirements in future periods 
while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and other post retirement benefit obligations and our future expense 
stock options 
the company has elected to follow the intrinsic value method of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb and related interpretations in accounting for its employee stock options 
under apb  because the exercise price of the company s employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant  generally no compensation expense is recognized 
pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share is disclosed in note segment and market information we report our results in three industry segments packaging products  merchandising displays and corrugated packaging  and paperboard 
no single external customer accounts for more than of our consolidated net sales 
during fiscal  the top customers represented approximately of our consolidated net sales 
the packaging products segment consists of facilities that produce folding cartons and interior packaging 
we compete with national  regional and local packaging suppliers operating in north america 
during fiscal  we sold packaging products to approximately  customers and the top customers accounted for approximately of the external sales of the packaging products segment 
we sell packaging products to customers in a variety of industries including customers in the food and beverage industries and to manufacturers of other non durable goods 
the merchandising displays and corrugated packaging segment consists of facilities that produce merchandising displays and flexographic and litho laminated corrugated packaging 
we compete with a number of national  regional and local suppliers of those goods in this segment 
during fiscal  we sold display products to approximately customers and corrugated packaging products to approximately customers 
the top customers of the segment accounted for approximately of external sales of the segment 
the paperboard segment consists of facilities that collect recovered paper and that manufacture recycled clay coated and specialty paperboard  corrugating medium  and laminated paperboard products 
our clay coated and specialty paperboard mills compete with integrated and non integrated companies operating in north america that manufacture various grades of paperboard as well as a limited amount of paperboard imported by manufacturers outside of north america 
our laminated paperboard products sales compete with a small number of national  regional and local companies offering highly specialized products 
we also compete with foreign companies in the book cover market 
our recycled fiber collection plants compete with national  regional and local companies 
during fiscal  we sold recycled paperboard  corrugating medium  laminated paperboard products and recovered paper to approximately  customers and the top external customers of the segment represented approximately of external sales 
for the fiscal year ended september   approximately of our segment sales were to internal customers  predominantly in our packaging products segment 
our paperboard segment s sales volumes may therefore be directly impacted by changes in demand for our packaging products and our laminated paperboard products 
all of our businesses operate in highly competitive industry segments 
we regularly bid for sales opportunities to customers for new business or for renewal of existing business 
the loss of business or the award of new business from our larger customers may have a significant impact on our results of operations 
in the third fiscal quarter of  a large merchandising display customer advised us that we will lose a substantial portion of its business as a result of a competitive request for proposal 
we currently believe that the loss of this business will be largely offset by certain new merchandising display business secured during fiscal see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
table of contents results of operations net sales aggregate by division merchandising displays and corrugated packaging segment 
see also business forward looking information and risk factors 
our ability to fully pass through fiber price increases can be limited based on competitive market conditions for various products that we sell and by the actions of our competitors 
in addition  most of our paperboard and paperboard based converted products are sold pursuant to term contracts that provide that prices are either fixed for specified terms  or provide for price adjustments based on changes in specified paperboard index prices 
the effect of these contractual provisions generally is to either limit the amount or delay our ability to recover announced price increases for paperboard 
the following table shows certain operating data for our three industry segments 
certain of our income and expenses are not allocated to our segments and are thus not reflected in the information used by management to make operating decisions and assess performance 
these items are reported as non allocated expenses 
these include elimination of intersegment profit  restructuring and related expenses and certain corporate expenses

the two acquisitions contributed million of the million increase in folding carton net sales 
higher volumes were partially offset by lower prices in the highly competitive environment 
our interior packaging division sales increased due to increased volume and our ability to pass a paperboard cost increase to our customers 
we believe the increased volume comes from increased sales in the beer and wine categories  which have increased significantly in relation to sales to food glass manufacturers 
the decrease in net sales of the packaging products segment before intersegment eliminations for fiscal as compared to fiscal was the result of lower volumes and selling prices in our interior packaging division offsetting the volume increases in our folding carton division 
the decline in sales prices reflected  in part  the pass through of lower costs for paperboard

the lower corrugated packaging sales relative to the prior year period was primarily the result of the september closure of our dothan  alabama facility and our sale of that facility s customer relationships 
sales at corrugated packaging locations other than dothan increased over the prior year 
the increase in net sales of merchandising displays was primarily due to growth from acquisitions made in fiscal the merchandising displays sales increased despite a weakening in the market for promotional displays 
in the third fiscal quarter of  a large merchandising display customer advised us that we will lose a substantial portion of its business as a result of a competitive request for proposal rfp 
we currently believe this loss of business will be largely offset by new merchandising display business we were awarded by another major customer in the second fiscal quarter of as a result of another competitive rfp 
therefore  although we believe sales of our merchandising displays will continue to grow  we do not anticipate that next year our merchandising display sales are likely to grow at its historical growth rate 
we also expect results for the next two quarters to be somewhat adversely affected by the costs associated with transitioning in and out of the business from the two customers 
the increase in net sales of the merchandising displays and corrugated packaging segment before intersegment eliminations for fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily the result of higher volumes in our merchandising display business  including the benefit of two major product launches on behalf of major national consumer products companies as well as two acquisitions we made during fiscal these results were partially offset by lower volumes in our corrugated packaging business due to generally weaker market conditions

total tons shipped for the year were down slightly at  but net sales in the segment were stable primarily due to an increase in fiber prices over the prior year 
fiber price increases were offset primarily by competitive pricing for clay coated recycled boxboard and by declines in sales of our laminated paperboard products  as we continued to experience a decrease in demand for our products by customers in the ready to assemble furniture and book industries 
the decrease in net sales of the paperboard segment before intersegment eliminations for fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to a decrease in demand for our products by customers in the book and ready to assemble furniture industries  which adversely affected the volumes of the laminated paperboard products and specialty paperboard businesses 
reduced volumes at our interior packaging business compared to fiscal further contributed to the sales decline 
these declines were partially offset by increased sales in our recycled fiber business due to an increase in fiber prices during the last half of fiscal cost of goods sold cost of goods sold for fiscal increased to  million from  million for fiscal cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales increased to for fiscal from for fiscal the increase in cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales resulted primarily from increases in raw material and energy costs and increases in operating costs in the paperboard division over the prior year

cost of goods sold for fiscal was relatively flat with a decrease to  million from  million for fiscal cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales for fiscal decreased to from for fiscal substantially all of our us inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on the last in  first out  or lifo  inventory valuation method  which we believe generally results in a better matching of current costs and revenues than under the first in  first out  or fifo  inventory valuation method 
in periods of increasing costs  the lifo method generally results in higher cost of goods sold than under the fifo method 
in periods of decreasing costs  the results are generally the opposite 
the following table illustrates the comparative effect of lifo and fifo accounting on our results of operations 
these supplemental fifo earnings reflect the after tax effect of eliminating the lifo adjustment each year

we expect to incur increased pension expense in fiscal of million  for a total of approximately million 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales for fiscal resulted primarily from continued focus on cost reductions and productivity improvements and decreased bad debt expense compared to the prior year resulting from lower total exposure to and improvements in the credit quality of several customers

we acquired cartem wilco to strengthen our presence in the health and beauty and pharmaceutical packaging markets and to expand our folding carton operations in canada 
the purchase price of this stock acquisition  including out of pocket expenses  was approximately million 
in august  we completed the acquisition of pacific coast packaging  a folding carton manufacturer located in kerman  california 
the purchase price of this transaction including the assumption of debt was approximately million 
we expect to pay additional consideration of approximately million during fiscal  representing an adjustment based on the achievement of certain sales levels for the six month period following the closing of the transaction 
we acquired pacific coast packaging both for its geographic significance and for the way it complements our current customer base and growth strategy 
pacific coast packaging is our first folding carton operation on the west coast 
it is a low cost producer of folding cartons for the quick serve food  in store deli  stock and gift box markets 
we accounted for these acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting  which requires us to record the assets and liabilities of the acquisitions at their estimated fair value and to record the excess of the purchase price over these amounts as goodwill 
we included the results of operations of cartem wilco and 
table of contents pacific coast packaging in our consolidated statements of operations from the respective dates of acquisition 
we have substantially completed the process of obtaining third party valuations of the property  plant and equipment acquired as well as certain intangible assets for cartem wilco and have begun the process of obtaining these valuations for pacific coast packaging 
until we complete these valuation processes  the allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed for each acquisition is preliminary and subject to refinement

 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity which we refer to as sfas 
sfas establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument within its scope as a liability 
many of these instruments were previously classified as equity 
sfas is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  it is to be implemented by reporting the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for financial instruments created before the issuance date of the statement and still existing at the beginning of the interim period of adoption 
restatement is not permitted

fsp sfas defers the provisions of paragraphs and of sfas as they apply to mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interests 
the deferral is expected to remain in effect while those issues are addressed in either phase ii of the fasb s liabilities and equity project or phase ii of the business combination project 
the fasb also decided to preclude any early adoption of the provisions in paragraphs and for these noncontrolling interests during the deferral period  and require the restatement of any financial statements that have been issued where these provisions of fas were applied to mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interests 
adoption of sfas did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements

 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities which we refer to as sfas 
sfas amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities under sfas the statement is intended to result in more consistent reporting of contracts as either freestanding derivative instruments subject to sfas in its entirety  or as hybrid instruments with debt host contracts and embedded derivative features 
sfas is generally effective for contracts entered into or modified after june  and for hedging relationships designated after june  the provisions of sfas that relate to sfas implementation issues that have been effective for fiscal quarters that began prior to june   should continue to be applied in accordance with their respective dates

in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb which we refer to as fin 
the primary objectives of fin are to provide guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than 
table of contents through voting rights which we refer to as variable interest entities or vies and how to determine when and which business enterprise should consolidate the vie which we refer to as the primary beneficiary 
this new model for consolidation applies to an entity in which either the equity investors if any do not have a controlling financial interest or the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity s activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
in addition  fin requires that both the primary beneficiary and all other enterprises with a significant variable interest in a vie make additional disclosures regarding the nature  purpose  size and activities of the vie and the enterprise s maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with the vie 
in october  the fasb issued fsp fin  effective date of fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fsp fin 
fsp fin delays the effective date for applying the provisions of fin for interests held by public entities in variable interest entities or potential variable interest entities created before february  and nonregistered investment companies 
we are required to adopt this interpretation no later than october  for any vies in which we hold a variable interest that we acquired before february  the interpretation is effective immediately for any vies created after january  and for vies in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date

 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others which we refer to as fin 
fin elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
fin also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of fin are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  we adopted the disclosure requirements of fin as of december  as of september   we have not entered into or modified any material guarantees subsequent to december   however  in may  we completed the purchase of the assets included in our synthetic lease facility  which terminated that facility 
we have made the following guarantees to unconsolidated third parties we have a ownership interest in seven hills paperboard  llc  a joint venture 
the partners of the joint venture guarantee funding of net losses in proportion to their share of ownership 
we lease certain manufacturing and warehousing facilities and equipment under various operating leases 
a substantial portion of these leases require us to indemnify the lessor in the event that additional taxes are assessed due to a change in the tax law 
we are unable to estimate our maximum exposure under these leases because it is dependent on changes in the tax law 
over the past several years  we have disposed of assets and subsidiaries and have assigned liabilities pursuant to asset and stock purchase agreements 
these agreements contain various representations and warranties such as authorization  ownership of assets  financial statements  legal proceedings  contracts  employees  employee benefit plans  environmental matters  patents  trademarks  trade names  brokers  finders and investment bankers  taxes  and products as well as various covenants 
these agreements may also provide specific indemnities for breaches of representations  warranties  or covenants as well as specific indemnification provisions 
these indemnification provisions address a variety of potential losses  including  among others losses related to liabilities other than those assumed  liabilities under environmental laws  and liabilities under applicable bulk sales laws 
these agreements may also define claims periods and liability limits that apply to specified indemnification provisions 
these indemnification provisions may be affected by various conditions and external factors 
many of the indemnification provisions issued or modified before december  have expired either by operation of law or as a result of the terms of the agreement 
we have not recorded any liability for the indemnifications issued or modified before december   and are not aware of any claims or other information that would give rise to material payments under such indemnities 
because of the lapse of time  or the fact that the parties have resolved certain issues  we are not aware of any outstanding indemnities issued or modified before december   the potential exposure for 
table of contents which we estimate would have a material impact on our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
under the terms of these agreements  including agreements entered into after september   our maximum aggregate potential liability on an undiscounted basis is approximately million  other than with respect to certain specified liabilities under environmental laws and with respect to breaches of environmental representations and warranties  with respect to which there is no limitation 
fin requires us to recognize  in the period during which we incur such an obligation  a liability based on our estimated exposure to such outstanding indemnities 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and commodity prices 
to mitigate these risks  we enter into various hedging transactions 
the sensitivity analyses presented below do not consider the effect of possible adverse changes in the general economy  nor do they consider additional actions management may take to mitigate its exposure to such changes 
there can be no assurance that we will manage or continue to manage any such risks in the future or that any such efforts will be successful 

table of contents derivative instruments we enter into a variety of derivative transactions 
we use interest rate swap agreements to manage the interest rate characteristics on a portion of our outstanding debt 
we use forward contracts to limit exposure to fluctuations in non functional foreign currency rates with respect to our operating units receivables 
we also use commodity swap agreements to limit our exposure to falling sales prices and rising raw material costs 
for each derivative instrument that is designated and qualifies as a fair value hedge  we recognize the gain or loss on the derivative instrument  as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk  in current earnings during the period of the changes in fair values 
for each derivative instrument that is designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge  we report the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and reclassify it into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings 
we recognize the remaining gain or loss on the derivative instrument in excess of the cumulative change in the present value of future cash flows of the hedged item  if any  in current earnings during the period of change 
we defer gains or losses on the termination of interest rate swap agreements and amortize the gains or losses as an adjustment to interest expense of the related debt instrument over the remaining term of the original contract life of the terminated swap agreements 
for derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments  we recognize the gain or loss in current earnings during the period of change 
we include the fair value of cash flow hedges in other long term liabilities and other assets on the balance sheet 
during fiscal  we realized cash proceeds of million by terminating the interest rate swaps that were designated as fair value hedges of our fixed rate debt and entering into comparable replacement interest rate swaps at then current market levels 
we do not expect any material impact on net income or change in interest rate risk from these transactions relative to our position prior to entering into these transactions 
interest rates we are exposed to changes in interest rates  primarily as a result of our short term and long term debt 
we use swap agreements to manage the interest rate characteristics of a portion of our outstanding debt 
based on the amounts and mix of fixed and floating rate debt at september  and september   if market interest rates increase an average of basis points  after considering the effects of our swaps  our interest expense would increase by million and million  respectively 
these amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing costs and interest rate swap agreements 
these analyses do not consider the effects of changes in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
market risks impacting pension plans our pension plans are influenced by trends in the financial markets and the regulatory environment 
adverse general stock market trends and falling interest rates increase plan costs and liabilities 
during fiscal and  the effect of a change in the discount rate would have impacted income before income taxes by approximately million and million  respectively 
foreign currency we are exposed to changes in foreign currency rates with respect to our foreign currency denominated operating revenues and expenses 
our principal foreign exchange exposure is the canadian dollar 
the canadian dollar is the functional currency of our canadian operations 
we have transaction gains or losses that result from changes in our operating units non functional currency 
for example  we have non functional currency exposure at our canadian operations because they have purchases and sales denominated in us dollars 
these gains or losses are recorded in foreign exchange gains and losses in the income statement 
from time to time  we enter into currency forward or option contracts to mitigate a portion of our transaction exposure 
as a result of the strengthening canadian dollar with respect to the us dollar  we recognized a transaction loss  including gains and losses on forward and 
table of contents option contracts  of and million in fiscal and  respectively 
to mitigate potential foreign currency transaction losses  we may utilize offsetting internal exposures or forward contracts 
we also have translation gains or losses that result from translation of the results of operations of an operating unit s foreign functional currency into us dollars for financial statement purposes 
as a result of the canadian dollar strengthening in relation to the us dollar in fiscal year  our translated  before tax earnings from our canadian operations were favorably impacted 
translated earnings were million higher in fiscal year than if we translated the same earnings using fiscal year exchange rates 
commodities the principal raw material used in the production of paperboard and corrugating medium is recycled fiber 
old corrugated containers which we refer to as occ is our largest fiber cost and accounts for approximately of our fiscal year purchases amount includes double lined kraft clippings  a source of recycled fiber  due to the high price correlation to occ 
the remaining of fiber purchases includes grades such as old newsprint and boxboard cuttings 
from time to time we make use of financial swap agreements to limit our exposure to rising occ prices 
with the effect of our occ swaps  a hypothetical increase in total fiber prices would have increased our costs by million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
in times of higher fiber prices  we may have the ability to pass a portion of the increased costs on to our customers in the form of higher finished product pricing 
solid bleached sulphate solid unbleached sulphate we purchase solid bleached sulphate which we refer to as sbs and solid unbleached sulphate which we refer to as sus from external sources to use in our folding carton converting business 
a hypothetical increase in sbs and sus prices in fiscal would have increased our costs by million and by million during fiscal in times of higher sbs and sus prices  we may have the ability to pass a portion of our increased costs on to our customers in the form of higher finished product pricing  however there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so 
linerboard corrugating medium we have the capacity to produce approximately  tons per year of corrugating medium at our st 
paul  mn operation 
from time to time  we make use of swap agreements to limit our exposure to falling corrugating medium prices at our st 
paul operation 
we estimate market risk as a hypothetical decrease in selling price 
with the effect of our medium swaps  such a decrease would have resulted in lower sales of million during fiscal in  a hypothetical decrease in selling prices would have resulted in lower sales of million 
we consume approximately  tons per year of corrugating medium and linerboard in our corrugated box converting operations 
a hypothetical increase in linerboard and corrugating medium pricing would have resulted in increased costs of million during fiscal and million during fiscal we may have the ability to pass a portion of our increased costs on to our customers in the form of higher finished product pricing 
energy we spent approximately million on energy in fiscal converting all purchases into mmbtu million british thermal units  we bought approximately million mmbtus during fiscal natural gas accounts for approximately of our total purchases or million mmbtus in fiscal without the effect of fixed price natural gas forward contracts  a hypothetical change in the price of energy would have increased our cost of energy by million during fiscal we spent approximately million on energy in fiscal converting all purchases into mmbtu  we bought approximately million mmbtus during fiscal natural gas accounts for approximately 
table of contents of our total purchases or million mmbtus in fiscal without the effect of fixed price natural gas forward contracts  a hypothetical change in the price of energy would have increased our cost of energy by million 
we periodically evaluate alternative scenarios to manage these risks
