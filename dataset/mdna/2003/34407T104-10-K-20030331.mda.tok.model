these include customer reservations  customer service  pricing  scheduling  revenue accounting  revenue management  frequent flyer administration  advertising  provision of ticket handling services at united s ticketing locations  and provision of airport signage and ground support services at most of the airports where both aca and united operate flights 
under the restated agreement  the company remains responsible for fees associated with the global distribution systems 
the ua agreements do not prohibit united from serving  or from entering into agreements with other airlines who would serve  routes served by the company  but state that united may terminate the ua agreements if acai or aca enter into a similar arrangement with any other carrier other than delta or a replacement for delta without united s prior written approval

ual is currently operating and managing its business and affairs as a debtor in possession 
as part of its first day filings in the bankruptcy proceeding  united requested and was granted a court order permitting  but not requiring it to continue to honor the ua agreements while united is in bankruptcy 
as such  the company continues to operate as a united express carrier pursuant to its ua agreement 
ual  inc and its subsidiaries have been granted the exclusive right until october   to file a plan of reorganization and the exclusive right until december   to seek acceptances of any such plan 
the court has set may  as the deadline for the filing of proofs of claim  although this deadline does not apply to claims arising under executory contracts and unexpired leases that have yet to be rejected by ual  inc and its subsidiaries

under the fee per block hour arrangement  the company is contractually obligated to operate a flight schedule designated by delta  for which delta pays the company an agreed amount per block hour flown regardless of the number of passengers carried  with incentive payments based on operational performance 
the company thereby assumes the risks associated with operating the flight schedule and delta assumes the risks of scheduling  marketing  and selling seats to the traveling public 
by operating as part of the delta connection program  the company is able to use delta s dl flight designator to identify aca s flights and fares in global distribution systems  including delta s deltamatic reservation system  and to use the delta connection logo and exterior aircraft paint schemes and uniforms similar to those of delta 
pursuant to the dl agreement  delta  at its expense  provides a number of support services to aca 
these include customer reservations  customer service  ground handling  station operations  a maintenance hangar facility in cincinnati  pricing  scheduling  revenue accounting  revenue management  frequent flyer administration  advertising and other passenger  aircraft and traffic servicing functions in connection with the aca operation

if delta terminates the delta agreement without cause prior to march  the company has the right to put all or some of the delta connection aircraft to delta 
the dl agreement requires the company to obtain delta s approval if it chooses to enter into a code sharing arrangement with another carrier other than in connection with termination of the ua agreements  to list its flights under any other code  or to operate flights for any other carrier  except with respect to such arrangements with united or non us code share partners of united or in certain other circumstances 
the dl agreement does not prohibit delta from serving  or from entering into agreements with other airlines that would serve  routes flown by the company 
the dl agreement also restricts the ability of the company to dispose of aircraft subject to the agreement without offering delta a right of first refusal to acquire such aircraft  and provides that delta may extend or terminate the agreement if  among other things  the company merges with or sells its assets to another entity  is acquired by another entity or if any person acquires more than a specified percentage of its stock

agreements with other airlines as of march  the company has implemented code sharing arrangements with lufthansa german airlines lufthansa  air canada  scandinavian airlines  british midland bmi  austrian airlines and all nippon airways involving certain united express flights 
such international code sharing arrangements permit these foreign air carriers to place their respective airline codes on certain flights operated by aca  and provide a wide range of benefits for passengers including schedule coordination  through ticketing and frequent flyer participation 
the revenue benefits from these arrangements accrue to united  and any such arrangements as may be made in the future with respect to the company s delta connection flights would accrue to delta  due to the nature of the company s agreements with these two airlines 
the company s primary role under these arrangements is to obtain regulatory approvals for the relationships and to operate the flights 
charter operations the company established a charter operation in february the charter business  which operates seat fairchild dornier jets  utilizes the company s operations and maintenance services 
the company is presently providing regular private shuttle service pursuant to an agreement with a major corporation and is performing ad hoc charter services secured through brokers and other means 
in march  the company decided to continue to service its existing clients but to de emphasize the solicitation of new charter business due to uncertainties regarding the bankruptcy of the jet manufacturer 
the company recently made some of these charter assets available to support its code share operations 
markets the company s united express operation is centered around washington s dulles and chicago s o hare airports 
beginning in and continuing throughout  the company greatly increased its chicago operation such that as of march  of the company s united express capacity as measured in available seat miles is flown to from chicago s o hare airport 
the growth in chicago results from the combination of adding complementary service to united mainline service in markets and replacing united mainline service completely in markets since june the delta connection operation is focused at boston s logan airport and cincinnati s northern kentucky international airport 
at delta s request  the company moved its remaining jet aircraft from new york s laguardia airport to cincinnati s northern kentucky international airport effective november  as of march  of the company s delta connection capacity as measured in available seat miles was to from boston  was to from cincinnati  with the remaining capacity to from new york kennedy

wayne  in south bend  in grand rapids  mi toledo  oh greensboro high point  nc tri cities  tn fleet description fleet expansion as of march   the company operated a fleet of bombardier crjs crjs  fairchild dornier regional jets jets  and british aerospace jetstream j s turboprop aircraft 
thirty one jets are operated in the delta connection program  crjs and j s are operated in the united express program  and two jets are currently flown in charter operations 
as of march   the company had a total of crjs on firm order from bombardier  inc  in addition to the already delivered  and held options for additional crjs 
the firm ordered aircraft include crjs that were ordered in july after fairchild dornier gmbh fairchild  the manufacturer of the seat jet  opened formal insolvency proceedings in germany and rejected the company s purchase agreement covering jets the company had on firm order and under option 
the company s agreement with bombardier provides for crjs to be delivered during the remainder of and an additional crjs to be delivered by april  due to a number of factors  including the united bankruptcy  the effect on the operations of the airline industry of the war with iraq  and the state of the financing markets  the company and bombardier have agreed to delay by two weeks the scheduled delivery date of two aircraft originally scheduled for march deliveries 
the company is considering the delay of future deliveries and is engaged in discussions with bombardier regarding financing and the aircraft delivery schedule 
see risk factors relating to the company below 
employees as of march   the company had  full time and part time employees  classified as follows classification full time part time pilots  flight attendants station personnel  maintenance personnel management  administrative and clerical personnel total employees  the company s pilots are represented by the airline pilots association alpa  flight attendants are represented by the association of flight attendants afa  and aviation maintenance technicians and ground service equipment mechanics are represented by the aircraft mechanics fraternal association amfa 
in january  the company agreed to a new four and a half year collective bargaining agreement with its pilot union that was subsequently ratified and became effective on february  the collective bargaining agreement covers pilots flying for the united express  delta connection  and charter operations 
the agreement provided for overall pilot costs that were  at the time  comparable to other similarly situated regional carriers with recently negotiated contracts who were operating under similar agreements with major airlines 
however  due to changes in the regional airline industry  the company believes that its overall pilot costs are presently at the high end of pilot costs relative to other regional carriers operating today 
the company has approached its pilot union with the intent to negotiate wage reductions and work rule changes through voluntary concessions  with the goal of bringing its pilot costs in line with other regional carriers that compete with the company for its existing and new business 
the company s collective bargaining agreement with amfa  which was ratified in june  became amendable in june  and its collective bargaining agreement with the afa  which was ratified in october  became amendable in october the company has entered into negotiations with amfa and afa regarding new agreements 
the company is continuing to negotiate with both unions  and management does not anticipate that there will be a material effect on the company s operations for the foreseeable future as a result of these discussions 
in the airline industry  labor relations are regulated by the railway labor act rla 
under the rla  collective bargaining agreements do not expire but  rather  become amendable 
the wage rates  benefits and work rules contained in a contract that has become amendable remain in place and represent the status quo until a successor agreement is in place 
the parties may not resort to self help  such as strikes or lockouts  until the rla processes for collective bargaining have been exhausted 
it is impossible to predict how long the rla processes will take  but if an early agreement cannot be reached it is not unusual for these processes to last months or more 
certain of the company s unrepresented labor groups are from time to time approached by unions seeking to represent them 
in  the international association of machinists and aerospace workers iam attempted to organize the company s customer service employees 
the company was informed by the national mediation board nmb that the iam did not receive a sufficient showing of interest from customer service employees to merit holding an election 
because of this  the nmb will not accept any application seeking representation of the company s customer service employees prior to march in february  the company was informed by the national mediation board that the transport workers union twu was seeking election to represent the company s dispatch employees 
the election will take place in early april 
the company is in the process of implementing a hiring freeze  wage reductions for salaried employees  and bonus plan reductions for all employees as a part of its cost cutting measures  as more fully detailed in management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition outlook and business risks below 
pilot training the company has entered into agreements with pan am international flight academy paifa  which allow the company to train crj  j and jet pilots at paifa s facility near washington dulles 
in  paifa relocated its washington dulles operations to a new training facility near the company s washington dulles headquarters 
this facility currently houses three crj simulators  a jet simulator  and a j simulator 
the company has agreements to purchase an annual minimum number of crj simulator training hours at agreed rates through the company s payment obligations for crj simulator usage over the remaining years of the agreements total approximately million 
in  paifa  cae schreiner and the company executed a simulator provision and service agreement providing for jet training at the paifa facility 
under this agreement  the company has committed to purchase all of its jet simulator time from paifa at agreed upon rates  with no minimum number of simulator hours guaranteed

industry regulation and airport access economic the department of transportation dot has extensive authority to issue certificates authorizing carriers to engage in air transportation  establish consumer protection regulations  prohibit certain unfair or anti competitive pricing practices  mandate conditions of carriage and make ongoing determinations of a carrier s fitness  willingness and ability to provide air transportation 
the dot can bring proceedings for the enforcement of its regulations under applicable federal statutes  which proceedings may result in civil penalties  revocation of operating authority or criminal sanctions 
the company s aca subsidiary holds a certificate of public convenience and necessity  issued by the dot  that authorizes it to conduct scheduled and charter air transportation of persons  property and mail between all points in the united states  its territories and possessions 
in addition  aca may conduct scheduled and charter air transportation to points outside the united states  subject to obtaining any necessary authority from any foreign country to be so served 
the certificate requires that aca maintain dot prescribed minimum levels of insurance  comply with all applicable statutes and regulations and remain continuously fit to engage in air transportation 
in addition to this authority  aca is authorized to engage in air transportation between the united states and canada 
the company s acjet subsidiary also holds a certificate of public convenience and necessity  issued by the dot  that authorizes it to conduct scheduled and charter air transportation of persons  property and mail between all points in the united states  its territories and possessions 
acjet is now a dormant company 
the only assets of acjet are its dot and faa air carrier operating certificates 
in the first quarter of  the company paid million to delta in order to remove all contractual restrictions to the use  sale or transfer of acjet and its certificates 
these certificates are subject to revocation for non use 
the company has requested and obtained a waiver from the dot and faa to permit it to continue to possess these certificates for a limited period of time even though they are not being utilized at this time 
the company has advised the dot of its plans to make future use of these certificates and  based on its statement of intent  has asked the dot to extend the waiver until june based on conditions in the industry  or as a result of congressional directives or statutes  the dot from time to time proposes and adopts new regulations or amends existing regulations that may impose additional regulatory burdens and costs on the company 
in addition  air carriers may volunteer to impose new or additional requirements on themselves to address congressional concerns or concerns expressed by the public  such as passenger rights initiatives 
imposition of new laws and regulations on air carriers or agreement on voluntary initiatives could increase the cost of operation and or limit carrier management discretion 
safety the faa extensively regulates the safety related activities of air carriers 
the company is subject to the faa s jurisdiction with respect to aircraft maintenance and operations  equipment  ground facilities  flight dispatch  communications  training  weather observation  flight personnel  airport security  the transportation of hazardous materials and other matters affecting air safety 
to ensure compliance with its regulations  the faa requires that airlines under its jurisdiction obtain an operating certificate and operations specifications for the particular aircraft and types of operations conducted by such airlines 
the company s aca subsidiary possesses an operating certificate and related authorities issued by the faa authorizing it to conduct operations with turboprop and turbojet equipment 
the company s acjet subsidiary possesses an operating certificate by the faa and related authorities authorizing it to conduct operations with turbojet equipment 
the company  like all carriers  requires specific faa authority to add aircraft to its fleet 
aca s authority to conduct operations is subject to suspension  modification or revocation for cause 
the faa has authority to bring proceedings to enforce its regulations  which proceedings may result in civil or criminal penalties or revocation of operating authority 
from time to the time and with varying degrees of intensity  the faa conducts inspections of air carriers 
such inspections may be scheduled or unscheduled and may be triggered by specific events involving either the specific carrier being inspected or other air carriers 
in addition  the faa may require airlines to demonstrate that they have the capacity to properly manage growth and safely operate increasing numbers of aircraft 
in order to ensure the highest level of safety in air transportation  the faa has authority to issue maintenance directives and other mandatory orders 
these relate to  among other things  the inspection of aircraft and the mandatory removal and replacement of parts or structures 
in addition  the faa from time to time amends its regulations and such amended regulations may impose additional regulatory burdens on the company  such as the required installation of new safety related items 
depending upon the scope of the faa s orders and amended regulations  these requirements may cause the company to incur substantial  unanticipated expenses that may not be reimbursable under the company s marketing agreements 
the faa enforces its maintenance regulations by the imposition of civil penalties  which can be substantial 
on november  the president signed into law the aviation and transportation security act the security act 
the security act requires heightened passenger  baggage and cargo security measures to be adopted as well as enhanced airport security procedures 
the security act created the transportation security administration tsa that has taken over the responsibility for conducting the screening of passengers and their baggage at the nation s airports as of february  the activities of the tsa are funded in part by the application of a per passenger enplanement security fee subject to a maximum of per one way trip and payment by all passenger carriers of a sum not exceeding each carrier s passenger and baggage screening cost incurred in calendar year the tsa was charged to have equipment in operation by the end of to be able to electronically screen all checked passenger baggage with explosive detection systems 
the tsa is also required to deploy federal air marshals on an increased number of passenger flights 
the security act imposes new and increased requirements for air carrier employee background checks and additional security training of flight and cabin crew personnel 
these additional and new requirements may increase the security related costs of the company 
the security act also mandates and the faa has adopted new rules requiring the strengthening of cockpit doors  some of the costs of which may be reimbursed by the faa 
the company completed level one fortification of its cockpit doors on all of its aircraft as of november   and began installing level two fortifications in december as of december   the company has received million in reimbursements from the faa for the mandated cockpit door modifications 
there is no guarantee that the company will be reimbursed in full for the cost of these modifications 
the modifications are expected to be completed during new passenger and baggage screening requirements have caused disruptions in the flow of passengers through airports and in some cases delayed airline operations 
the company may experience security related disruptions in the future  including reduced passenger demand for air travel  but believes that its exposure to such disruptions is no greater than that faced by other providers of regional air carrier services 
although the tsa has taken over the former responsibilities of the air carriers for the screening of all passengers and baggage  the tsa  as with the faa before it  requires air carriers to adopt and enforce procedures designed to safeguard property  and to protect airport and aircraft against terrorist acts 
the tsa  from time to time  may impose additional security requirements on air carriers and airport authorities based on specific threats or world conditions or as otherwise required 
the tsa has issued a number of security directives and altered procedures upon changes in the office of homeland security announcements of heightened threat levels  and the company has adjusted its security procedures on numerous occasions in response to these directives 
the company incurred substantial expense in complying with current security requirements and it cannot predict what additional security requirements may be imposed in the future or the cost of complying with such requirements 
associated with the faa s security responsibility is its program to ensure compliance with rules regulating the transportation of hazardous materials 
the company has policies against accepting hazardous materials or other dangerous goods for transportation 
employees of the company are trained in the recognition of hazardous materials and dangerous goods through an faa approved training course 
the company may ship aircraft and other parts and equipment  some of which may be classified as hazardous materials  using the services of third party carriers  both ground and air 
in acting in the capacity of a shipper of hazardous materials  the company must comply with applicable regulations 
the faa enforces its hazardous material regulations by the imposition of civil penalties  which can be substantial 
other regulation 
in the maintenance of its aircraft fleet and ground equipment  the company handles and uses many materials that are classified as hazardous 
the environmental protection agency and similar local agencies have jurisdiction over the handling and processing of these materials 
the company is also subject to the oversight of the occupational safety and health administration concerning employee safety and health matters 
the company is subject to the federal communications commission s jurisdiction regarding the use of radio frequencies 
federal law establishes maximum aircraft noise and emissions limits 
at the present time  all of the aircraft operated by the company comply with all applicable federal noise and emissions regulations 
federal law generally preempts airports from imposing unreasonable local noise rules that restrict air carrier operations 
however  under certain circumstances airport operators may implement reasonable and nondiscriminatory local noise abatement procedures  which procedures could impact the ability of the company to serve certain airports  particularly in off peak hours 
slots 
slots are reservations for takeoffs and landings at specified times and are required by governmental authorities to operate at certain airports 
the company has rights to and utilizes takeoff and landing slots at chicago o hare and new york kennedy and white plains  new york airports 
the company also uses slot exemptions at chicago o hare  which differ from slots in that they allow service only to designated cities and are not transferable to other airlines without the approval of the us department of transportation dot 
airlines may acquire slots by governmental grant  by lease or purchase from other airlines  or by loan when another airline does not use a slot but desires to avoid governmental reallocation of a slot for lack of use 
all leased and loaned slots are subject to renewal and termination provisions 
all slot regulation was eliminated at chicago o hare after july  and  under rules presently in effect  is scheduled to end at new york kennedy after january  the rules also provide that  in addition to those slots currently held by carriers  operators of regional jet aircraft may apply for  and the secretary of transportation must grant  additional slots at new york kennedy in order to permit the carriers to offer new service  increase existing service or upgrade to regional jet service in qualifying smaller communities 
there is no limit on the number of slots a carrier may request 
risk factors affecting the company the company s business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties  as described below and in the section titled  management s discussion and analysis of operations and financial condition outlook and business risks and liquidity and capital resources 
substantially all of the company s revenue is derived under contracts with its code share partners 
the majority of the company s flights are operated under the united express or delta connection brand 
as such  the company must rely on its code share partners to provide numerous services such as reservations  ticketing  route planning  and customer service and ground handling at certain stations 
the company s revenue and operations are reliant on the ability of these partners to manage their operations and cash flow  and ability and willingness of these partners to continue to deploy the company s aircraft and to utilize and pay for scheduled service at agreed upon rates 
the code share partner that accounted for approximately of the company s revenue in is in bankruptcy 
the company devotes a substantial portion of its business to its operations with united  and obtains substantial services from united in operating that business 
the company s future operations are substantially dependent on united s successful emergence from bankruptcy and on the affirmation or renegotiation of the company s ua agreement by united on acceptable terms  or on the company s ability to successfully establish an alternative to the united business and services 
if united seeks to renegotiate the terms of the ua agreements  a renegotiated agreement is likely to be on terms that are less favorable to the company with regard to operating margins and could possibly result in the deployment of fewer aircraft than currently contracted and or be less favorable to the company in other respects  which would adversely affect the company s earnings and or growth prospects 
there is no assurance that united will successfully emerge from bankruptcy  and united has said that its liquidation is a possibility 
if united does not succeed in reorganizing its operations and emerging from bankruptcy  and instead files for a liquidation under chapter of the us bankruptcy code  the company would be faced with the prospect of having to quickly find another code share partner or to develop the airline related infrastructure necessary to operate as an independent airline 
the company anticipates that there would be an interruption in its services during a transition period  the length of which would be dependent on several factors including how soon united liquidates 
the company has commenced planning for these contingencies and will continue to pursue actions management believes appropriate in the event that united liquidates under chapter there are no assurances that the company will be able to find another code share partner or be able to compete as an independent airline  and any prolonged stoppage of flying would materially adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial position 
any failure to timely or successfully implement alternative contingency plans could have a material adverse effect on the company and its viability 
the company s agreement with bombardier provides for crjs to be delivered during the remainder of and an additional crjs to be delivered by april  all of these aircraft were ordered for use in the company s united express operations 
due to the united bankruptcy and other factors  including the adverse effects on the airline industry of the war with iraq and the state of the financing markets  the company and bombardier have agreed to delay by two weeks the scheduled delivery date of two aircraft originally scheduled for march deliveries 
the company is considering the delay of future deliveries and is engaged in discussions with bombardier regarding financing and aircraft delivery schedules 
see the discussion below regarding risks from the company s dealings with bombardier 
united s bankruptcy filing may affect the company in other ways that it is not currently able to anticipate or plan for 
the average utilization of aircraft in the united express operation has declined and the rates for have not been adjusted 
the ua agreements call for the resetting of fee per departure rates annually based on the company s and united s planned level of operations for the upcoming year 
the average utilization of aircraft in the united express operation has declined  and as a result  the company is seeking a rate adjustment for consistent with its interpretation of the united express agreements that would  among other things  offset this reduction in utilization 
the company and united are in discussions regarding the fee per departure rates to be utilized during until new rates are established for  united is paying the company based on rates and the company is recording its revenue in using the rates established for there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully reset fee per departure rates 
failure to reset fee per departure rates with united for could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating margins in the company relies on third party financing to pay for the jets that it has contractually committed to purchase 
the company has contractual commitments with bombardier for the delivery of crjs to be delivered during and an additional crjs to be delivered by april  the company has generally relied on leveraged lease transactions involving investments by institutional or industrial investors that provide debt and equity capital to finance the purchase price of aircraft it has committed to purchase 
in a leveraged lease  there is an equity source for to of the purchase price and a debt source for the remaining to of the purchase price 
with the uncertainty of united s future and the continued deterioration in industry conditions  the company has been unable to secure equity funding on any terms for its remaining firm ordered aircraft 
the inability to finance aircraft that the company desires to purchase may affect the company s growth prospects 
the company has a contingent commitment from economic development corporation of canada edc for debt financing of its next four aircraft scheduled for delivery 
as a result of the bankruptcy of united  edc s debt funding obligation is contingent upon the company obtaining a waiver from edc 
the company may not be able to obtain such waivers in the future and may not be able to obtain debt financing from edc or others once the current edc financing commitment is no longer available 
the company is considering the delay of future aircraft deliveries and is engaged in discussions with bombardier regarding financing and aircraft delivery schedules 
if the company is unable to obtain permanent aircraft financing at the time that it accepts any aircraft for delivery  it may be required to fund aircraft purchases from its own cash or to rely on temporary financing from the aircraft manufacturer 
the company does not have the financial resources to pay the full purchase price for all of the aircraft that it currently has on order 
if the company is unable to delay deliveries or pay for aircraft on order  bombardier may assert a claim for damages 
the company is under pressure to control and reduce its costs 
the economic downturn reduced demand for air travel and the success of low cost carriers has resulted in increased emphasis in the airline industry on controlling and reducing expenses 
the company has embarked on a cost reduction program with the goal of reducing annualized operating expenses by approximately 
as part of this program  the company has implemented a hiring freeze  has begun furloughing excess pilots  has eliminated or reduced bonus programs  and has implemented salary reductions ranging from to for all salaried employees paid more than  per year 
the effect of salary reductions and the elimination of and changes in bonus plans for those salaried employees is anticipated to reduce cash compensation by between and with the reductions affecting the company s senior management and officers the most 
the company has approached alpa with the intent to negotiate similar levels of wage reductions and work rule changes through voluntary concessions 
in order for the company to achieve all of its cost reduction goals  it will require cooperation from its employees  major vendors and code share partners 
if the company is unable to control and reduce its costs  it may not be able to effectively compete against other regional carriers to maintain or expand its existing operations 
the company has unexpected costs and possible exposure arising from the bankruptcy of fairchild dornier gmbh 
in july  fairchild dornier gmbh fairchild  the manufacturer of the seat fairchild dornier jet jet  opened formal insolvency proceedings in germany 
fairchild had been operating under the guidance of a court appointed interim trustee since april at the time of the opening of formal insolvency proceedings  fairchild had significant current and future obligations to the company in connection with the company s order of jet aircraft 
fairchild subsequently notified the company that it was rejecting the company s purchase agreement contract covering the remaining jets the company had on firm order  and options to acquire additional aircraft 
the company s costs to operate its current fleet of jets increased in and may continue to increase in the future due to fairchild s failure to provide warranty and product support and the limited availability of spare parts 
the company has filed a claim against fairchild dornier gmbh and its subsidiaries for million in damages as a result of fairchild s insolvency proceedings but does not expect funds to be available to satisfy any of its claim 
dornier aviation of north america dana  one of the us subsidiaries of fairchild dornier gmbh  has filed a lawsuit against the company claiming amounts allegedly due for certain spare parts  late charges and consignment inventory carrying charges 
the company is claiming the right of offset for any amounts owed

at the time of its bankruptcy  fairchild had significant obligations to the company in connection with the company s order of jets  including providing the company financial support in its retirement of j aircraft 
as a result of fairchild s bankruptcy and its failure to satisfy its obligations to the company  the company may continue to experience higher than expected or unexpected costs in its operations or may encounter consequences or risks that the company is not able to anticipate or plan for 
the company s current operations benefit from government support for insurance costs 
following the september terrorist attacks  the aviation insurance industry imposed a worldwide surcharge on aviation insurance rates as well as a reduction in coverage for certain war risks 
in response to the reduction in coverage  the air transportation safety and system stabilization act provides us air carriers with the option to purchase certain war risk liability insurance from the united states government on an interim basis at rates that are more favorable than those available from the private market 
prior to december  the company purchased hull war risk coverage through the private insurance market  and purchased liability war risk coverage through a combination of us government provided insurance and private insurance 
in december  the us government offered to provide additional war risk coverage that included certain risks previously covered by private insurance 
the company has purchased  at rates that are significantly lower than those charged by private insurance carriers  hull and liability war risk coverage from the us government through april  these savings are passed through to the company s code share partners pursuant to its current ua and dl agreements 
the company anticipates that it will renew the government insurance for as long as the coverage is available  and then obtain this coverage through the private insurance market 
under the company s ua and dl agreements  the company passes through the cost of insurance to its partners 
however  the inability to obtain insurance at any cost or the availability of insurance only at excessive rates  could affect the company s ability to operate 
the company s contracts with two of its unions currently are amendable 
the company s contract with aircraft mechanics fraternal association amfa  which was ratified in june  became amendable in june  and its contract with the association of flight attendants afa  which was ratified in october  became amendable in october the amfa contract covers all aviation maintenance technicians and ground service equipment mechanics working for the company and the afa contract covers all flight attendants working for the company 
the company has entered into initial discussions with amfa and with afa regarding new agreements 
although there can be no assurances as to the outcome of these negotiations  the company anticipates ultimately being able to reach agreement with both unions on mutually satisfactory contracts with no material effect on its results of operations or financial position 
however  the failure to resolve these negotiations on appropriate terms could affect the company s ability to compete effectively 
the us airline industry is experiencing significant restructurings and bankruptcies 
the current us airline industry environment is probably the worst in its history 
beginning in early  the industry has experienced depressed demand and shifts in passenger demand  lower unit revenues  increased insurance costs  increased fuel costs  increased government regulations and taxes  and tightened credit markets  evidenced by higher credit spreads and reduced capacity to borrow 
these factors are directly affecting the operations and financial condition of participants in the industry including the company  its code share partners  and aircraft manufacturers 
the company s contractual relationships with others may continue to be affected by other companies bankruptcies or by concerns regarding potential bankruptcies 
the bankruptcy or prospect of bankruptcy among other companies with which the company deals or which operate in the company s industry may result in unexpected expenses and create other risks or uncertainties that the company is not able to anticipate or plan around 
the travel industry has been materially adversely affected by the september  terrorist attacks and the conflict in the middle east 
the terrorist attacks of september  adversely affected the company and the airline industry by significantly increasing the costs of security screening and insurance  while reducing overall demand for air transportation 
instability in the middle east and the start of the us led war with iraq has increased the risk that the industry will continue to be adversely affected by reduced demand  increased security costs  increased fuel costs  and other factors 
while the company s code share agreements allow it to recover these additional expenses from its partners  the effects of any new terrorist attacks and or a long term us led war in the middle east could materially adversely affect the company and its code share partners in ways that the company is not able to anticipate or plan around

at the time of fairchild s insolvency  the company had outstanding invoices due to fairchild for various spare parts purchases 
the company believes it has the right to offset these and other amounts claimed by fairchild against obligations due from fairchild that will not be fulfilled as a result of the insolvency 
fairchild related entities dispute this right of offset  and in september  fairchild s wholly owned us subsidiary  dornier aviation of north america dana  filed a lawsuit against the company in the united states bankruptcy court for the eastern district of virginia civil action no 
ssm seeking to recover payments for certain spare parts  late payment charges  and consignment inventory carrying charges

united states district court  southern district of new york  case no 
cv  were commenced by or on behalf of individuals who were injured or killed on the ground in the attack on the pentagon through the hijacking of an american airlines aircraft originating at dulles airport 
in each case  the plaintiffs have named all airlines operating at dulles airport  including the company  under the theory that all of the airlines are jointly responsible for the alleged security breaches by the dulles security contractor  argenbright security 
the company has joined a motion filed on behalf of american and other defendants seeking dismissal of all ground victim claims on the basis that the airline defendants do not owe a duty as a matter of law to individuals injured or killed on the ground 
it is anticipated that the judge will rule on this motion during the second quarter if this ruling is not favorable  the company anticipates that it will raise other defenses including its assertion that it is not responsible for the incidents 
the company anticipates that other similar lawsuits could be filed on behalf of other victims 
from time to time  claims are made against the company with respect to activities arising from its airline operations 
typically these involve injuries or damages incurred by passengers and are considered routine to the industry 
on april   one of the company s insurers on its comprehensive aviation liability policy  legion insurance company  a subsidiary of mutual risk management ltd 
legion  was placed into rehabilitation by the commonwealth of pennsylvania  its state of incorporation 
during the time that legion is in rehabilitation  pennsylvania has ordered that legion pay no claims  expenses or other items of debt without its approval 
consequently  the company now directly carries the corresponding exposure related to legion s contribution percentage for payouts of claims and expenses that legion represented on the company s all risk hull and liability insurance for the   and policy years 
those contribution percentages are for claims arising from incidents occurring in  for  for  and for first quarter of legion ceased to be an insurer for the company as of april   and there is  therefore  no exposure with respect to legion for claims arising after that date 
the insurance held by legion on the company s policy was fully covered by reinsurance  which means that other carriers are contractually obligated to cover all claims that are direct obligations of legion 
while there are contractual provisions to the effect that reinsurance funds are to be directly applied against the company s liabilities  it is anticipated that legion s creditors will attempt to obtain court authority to apply these funds against legion s other obligations 
it is anticipated that legion ultimately will not be able to cover its obligations to the company except to the extent of recovery through reinsurance 
if legion s creditors are able to apply reinsurance proceeds against legion s general obligations  the company will be underinsured for these claims at the percentages set forth above 
this underinsurance would include the september related lawsuits described above and any other similar lawsuits that are brought against the company 
the company has accrued reserves of approximately  for the likely exposure on claims known to date 
no reserves have been accrued for the september related claims 
the company is a party to routine litigation and to faa civil action proceedings  all of which are viewed to be incidental to its business  and none of which the company believes are likely to have a material effect on the company s financial position or the results of its operations

the statements in this annual report are made as of march  and the company undertakes no obligation to update any of the forward looking information included in this release  whether as a result of new information  future events  changes in expectations or otherwise 
certain of these risk factors are discussed more fully above under business risk factors affecting the company 
the us airline industry continues to experience depressed demand and shifts in passenger demand  increased insurance costs  changing and increased government regulations and tightened credit markets  evidenced by higher credit spreads and reduced capacity 
these factors are directly affecting the operations and financial condition of participants in the industry including the company  its code share partners  and aircraft manufacturers 
although recent steps taken by the major us carriers to return to profitability have tended to increase the importance of regional jets to the industry  future implementation of regional jet programs will depend on market conditions and relative cost structures 
aggressive cost cutting by major airlines  including united s actions in bankruptcy  have reduced the gap between trip costs for the major airlines smallest jets relative to regional jets  thus putting increased pressure on regional jet operators to also decrease their costs 
moreover  the ongoing losses incurred by the industry continue to raise substantial risks and uncertainties 
as discussed below  these risks may impact the company  its code share partners  and aircraft manufacturers in ways that the company is not currently able to predict 
in anticipation of the start of the war with iraq and the continued deterioration of the economics in the airline industry  the company embarked on a cost reduction program with the goal of reducing annualized unit operating expenses by approximately 
as part of this program  the company implemented a hiring freeze  began furloughing excess pilots  eliminated or reduced bonus programs  and implemented salary reductions ranging from to for all salaried employees 
the elimination of and changes in bonus plans and salaries for those management employees paid more than  per year is anticipated to reduce cash compensation by between and for salaried employees with the largest reductions affecting the company s officers 
the company has also approached alpa with the intent to negotiate similar pay reductions and work rule changes where appropriate to assure that the company s costs are at market rates 
in order for the company to achieve all of its cost reduction goals  it will require cooperation from its employees  the unions representing its employees  major vendors and code share partners 
the company derives substantially all of its revenue under long term code share agreements with united and delta 
in addition to the crjs  jets  and j s in service as of march   the company has firm orders for an additional crjs from bombardier inc  with option orders for crjs 
all of the firm ordered aircraft were ordered for use in the company s united express operations 
under these agreements  the company is dependent on united and delta for substantially all of its revenue and for providing support services necessary to operate its aircraft  and is dependent on bombardier for providing aircraft and other support 
business or operational difficulties  liquidity problems or bankruptcy of any of these entities could materially impact the company s operations and financial condition 
see the discussion below in this recent developments and outlook section with respect to the company s present considerations regarding future deliveries 
in response to industry conditions  both united and delta are changing how the company s regional jet aircraft are utilized 
in the past  regional jets were primarily deployed to open new long  thin routes and to replace some turboprop service in higher traffic markets 
the company continues to work closely with its two major partners  united airlines and delta air lines  to provide value and cost efficiencies in the current difficult airline environment 
for united  the company has added crjs into chicago s o hare airport allowing united to offer all jet united express service from chicago o hare as of august faa slot restrictions at chicago s o hare airport were eliminated effective july  which removed a barrier to the company s providing additional service there 
at delta s request  the company moved its jet flights operating from new york s laguardia airport to cincinnati  ohio effective november  these network changes will allow delta to more closely match aircraft capacity with route demand 
the stage length for flights out of cincinnati are on average shorter than those previously flown out of new york s laguardia airport 
the company anticipates that its overall operating costs at cincinnati will be lower than costs incurred while operating at laguardia  however  its unit costs overall will be higher as a result of shorter stage lengths coupled with an increase in maintenance costs on the due to the insolvency filing by fairchild 
the company reset its rate per block hour with delta in january  in accordance with the terms of its agreement  and these rates reflect the anticipated impact of higher unit costs due to cincinnati based flying 
on december   ual  inc and its subsidiaries  including united  filed for protection under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
ual is currently operating and managing its business and affairs as a debtor in possession 
as part of its first day filings in the bankruptcy proceeding  united requested and was granted a court order permitting  but not requiring it to continue to honor the ua agreements while united is in bankruptcy 
as such  the company continues to operate as a united express carrier pursuant to its ua agreement 
ual  inc and its subsidiaries have been granted the exclusive right until october   to file a plan of reorganization and the exclusive right until december   to seek acceptances of any such plan 
the court has set may  as the deadline for the filing of proofs of claim  although this deadline does not apply to claims arising under executory contracts and unexpired leases that have yet to be rejected by ual  inc and its subsidiaries 
it is possible that any or all of the foregoing deadlines may be extended 
in bankruptcy  united also has the right to assume or reject the company s ua agreements  as described in recent development and outlook below 
no deadline has been set for united to assume or reject the company s ua agreements 
if united seeks to renegotiate the terms of the ua agreements  a renegotiated agreement is likely to be on terms that are less favorable to the company with regard to operating margins and in other respects  which would adversely affect the company s earnings and or growth prospects 
the company cannot predict the outcome of united s decision 
as of december   the company believes that united owed aca approximately million as of the date of united s bankruptcy filing for unpaid pre petition obligations relating to united express services prior to the filing and that  if these pre petition amounts are not ultimately paid by united  aca will have the right to offset amounts aca owes united for pre petition services totaling approximately million 
as of december   the company has taken a pre tax charge of million relating to this unpaid pre petition obligation 
the company continues to assess the effects of the bankruptcy filing by united airlines and its related companies 
the company devotes a substantial portion of its business to its operations with united  and obtains substantial services from united in operating that business 
the company s future operations are substantially dependent on united s successful emergence from bankruptcy and on the affirmation or renegotiation of the company s ua agreement by united on acceptable terms  or on the company s ability to successfully establish an alternative to the united business and services 
there is no assurance that united will successfully emerge from bankruptcy  and united has said that liquidation is a possibility 
if united does not succeed in reorganizing its operations and emerging from bankruptcy  and instead files for a liquidation under chapter of the us bankruptcy code  the company would be faced with the prospect of having to quickly find another code share partner or to develop the airline related infrastructure to fly as an independent airline 
the company has commenced planning for these contingencies and will continue to pursue actions management believes appropriate in the event that united liquidates under chapter the company anticipates that there would be an interruption in its services during a transition period  the length of which would be dependent on several factors including how soon united liquidates 
there are no assurances that the company will be able to find another code share partner or be able to compete as an independent airline  and any prolonged stoppage of flying would materially adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial position 
united s bankruptcy filing may affect the company in other ways that it is not currently able to anticipate or plan for 
the ua agreements call for the resetting of fee per departure rates annually based on the company and united s planned level of operations for the upcoming year 
the company and united are in discussions regarding the fee per departure rates to be utilized during during  the average utilization of aircraft in the united express operation declined  and as a result  the rates do not adequately reflect decreases in the company s aircraft utilization 
in the first quarter of  utilization of the company s aircraft has continued to decline relative to fourth quarter levels 
the company is seeking a rate adjustment for consistent with its interpretation of the united express agreements that would  among other things  offset this reduction in utilization 
until new rates are established for  united is paying the company based on rates and the company is recording its revenue in using the rates established for there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully reset fee per departure rates 
unless the company is successfully able to reset its fee per departure rates with united or to significantly reduce costs or increase utilization  its operating margins for will be materially affected 
the company s delta connection service commenced revenue service with jets during the third quarter of and added crjs during the fourth quarter of approximately million in start up expenses from inception through commencement of revenue service were incurred  which were expensed as incurred 
delta is reimbursing the company for million of these costs  and the amounts are being recorded as revenue ratably through july through december   the company has recorded million of this revenue 
in january  the company and delta agreed to rates  consistent with the rate setting process contained in the dl agreement 
the company s agreement with bombardier provides for crjs to be delivered during the remainder of and an additional crjs to be delivered by april  the company has generally financed its new aircraft deliveries through leverage lease structures involving investments by institutional or industrial investors who provide debt and equity capital to finance the company s aircraft 
this type of financing has been more difficult to obtain since september  both in terms of cost and sources of funds 
although the company has finalized funding arrangements for all aircraft delivered through march   the company has not been able to locate equity funding  which provides approximately of the aircraft acquisition cost  for any further deliveries and had obtained contingent debt commitments for only four undelivered aircraft 
the availability of funding  particularly equity funding  remains uncertain 
the company has a contingent commitment from economic development corporation of canada edc for debt financing of four aircraft originally scheduled for delivery in march and april as a result of the bankruptcy of united  edc s debt funding obligation is contingent upon the company obtaining a waiver from edc 
since the united bankruptcy filing through the date of this filing  the company has been successful in obtaining such waivers 
the company has been in discussions with edc to provide debt financing for additional ordered aircraft 
the company may be forced to utilize its own funds for equity investments or to seek alternative sources of funding a portion of its aircraft deliveries 
due to a number of factors  including the united bankruptcy  the effect on the operations of the airline industry of the war with iraq  and the state of the financing markets  the company and bombardier have agreed to delay by two weeks the delivery of two aircraft originally scheduled for march deliveries 
the company is considering the delay of future deliveries and is engaged in discussions with bombardier regarding financing and the aircraft delivery schedule 
as a result of these discussions  bombardier is withholding approximately million in payments due to the company for amounts owed under the company s aircraft purchase agreements 
in addition  as of february  the company had million on deposit with bombardier for future aircraft orders 
in july  fairchild  the manufacturer of the seat jet  opened formal insolvency proceedings in germany 
fairchild had been operating under the guidance of a court appointed interim trustee since april fairchild subsequently notified the company that it has rejected the company s purchase agreement covering the remaining jets the company had on firm order for its united express operation  two jets on firm order for the company s private shuttle operation  and options to acquire additional aircraft 
at the time of the opening of formal insolvency proceedings  fairchild had significant current and future obligations to the company in connection with the company s order of jet aircraft 
these include obligations to deliver jets the company had on firm order for its united express operation  two jets on firm order for the private shuttle operation  and additional option jets with certain financing support  to pay the company the difference between the sublease payments  if any  received from remarketing j turboprop aircraft leased by the company and the lease payment obligations of the company on those aircraft  to purchase five j aircraft owned by the company at their net book value at the time of retirement  to assume certain crew training costs  and to provide spares  warranty  engineering  and related support 
in august  the company filed its claim in the fairchild insolvency proceeding 
the fairchild insolvency trustee indicated that it is unlikely that funds will be available for claims by unsecured creditors 
during the first quarter  the trustee indicated that he is finalizing plans to sell portions of the prior business including the production and support of jets 
the company anticipates that long term product support would be improved should the businesses be successfully transitioned to a new owner  but does not have any knowledge as to whether a sale of these businesses can in fact be completed or whether production can be resumed 
in addition  the company does not anticipate that such a sale will have an effect on its prior contractual commitments or on its bankruptcy claim 
the company believes it has a security interest in fairchild s equity interest in delivered jets  under which its right to proceed against this collateral will apply upon termination of the applicable lease unless other arrangements are made with the other interested parties 
the company s balance sheet as of december  includes a receivable for million with respect to deposits placed with fairchild for undelivered aircraft 
the company holds a bond from an independent insurance company that was delivered to secure this deposit  and has made a demand for payment under this bond 
fairchild s insolvency trustee has made a claim for the collateral posted with the insurance company  and the insurance company has withheld payment of the bond 
the matter is presently with the us bankruptcy court for the western district of texas 
the company s balance sheet as of december  also includes approximately million due from fairchild  resulting from payments made or owed by the company to third parties for certain training and other matters that were to be paid by fairchild 
to the extent the company does not prevail in its claims  it may be required to take a charge for all or a portion of the million due from fairchild for third party expenses  or the million in deposits secured by the bond 
at the time of fairchild s insolvency  the company had outstanding invoices due to fairchild for various spare parts purchases 
the company believes it has the right to offset these and other amounts claimed by fairchild against obligations due from fairchild  to the extent permitted by law 
fairchild related entities dispute this right  and fairchild s wholly owned us subsidiary  dornier aviation of north america dana  has filed a lawsuit against the company claiming amounts allegedly due for certain spare parts  late payment charges  and consignment inventory carrying charges 
dana contends that although its german parent company may not have fulfilled its contractual obligations to the company  dana sold spare parts to the company independent of its parent company s activities and that there is no right of offset 
the company acknowledges that approximately million in outstanding invoices existed  while dana claims that an additional million is due 
the action is presently in the discovery stage and it is anticipated that a trial will be held during the summer of the company s costs to operate its current fleet of jets increased in  and may continue to increase in the future due to costs incurred for maintenance repairs that otherwise would have been covered by the manufacturer s warranty and the costs and limited availability of spare parts 
additionally  as a result of fairchild s rejection of the purchase contract  the company does not expect fairchild to satisfy its obligation to pay the difference in the sublease payments  if any  received from remarketing the j aircraft leased by the company on those aircraft and the amount due under the company s aircraft leases 
on june   the company and united agreed to an amendment to the company s ua agreement authorizing the company to operate an additional crjs in lieu of jets that were to have been delivered by fairchild  with the additional aircraft to be placed in service no later than april  the company entered into agreements with bombardier for the purchase of additional seat crjs to replace the two delivered and undelivered seat jets for its united express operation 
the company now has firm orders for additional crjs as of march   and continues to hold options for an additional crjs 
see below with respect to the company s present considerations regarding future deliveries 
fairchild had the obligation to purchase five j aircraft owned by the company at their net book value at the time of their retirement 
as a result of fairchild s rejection of the purchase contract  the company does not expect fairchild to satisfy this obligation 
the company is required to evaluate the book value of its long lived assets as compared to estimated fair market value 
the company now estimates that the fair market value of four of the five owned j aircraft will be  in the aggregate  million below book value when the aircraft are retired from the fleet 
as a result  the company is recognizing million in additional depreciation charges related to such aircraft over their remaining estimated service lives 
as of december   the company had recognized million of this additional depreciation expense 
in june the company reconfirmed its commitment to united to remove its remaining j turboprop aircraft from service no later than april  the company has long term lease commitments for of these j aircraft and owns j aircraft 
during  the company recorded aircraft early retirement operating charges totaling million million net of income tax for the non discounted value of future lease payments and other costs associated with the early retirement of j turboprop aircraft 
the total aircraft early retirement charges reflects a charge of million million after tax in the fourth quarter of relating to j aircraft which are expected to be retired by the fourth quarter of  a million charge million after tax in the third quarter of related to expected scheduled aircraft retirements by the third quarter of  and a million million after tax credit to income in the second quarter of to reverse a portion of its prior aircraft early retirement charge of million million after tax recorded in the fourth quarter of the company estimates that it will expense approximately million pre tax to retire the remaining leased j s as they are retired during the company plans to actively remarket the j s through leasing  subleasing or outright sale of the aircraft 
any of these arrangements involving leased aircraft may require the company to make payments to the lessor to cover shortfalls between sale prices and lease stipulated loss values 
significant delays in the delivery of the remaining crjs on firm order could negatively impact the company s ability to complete its early aircraft retirement plan for the j turboprop fleet 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   the company had cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments of million and working capital of million compared to million and million  respectively  as of december  during the year ended december   cash and cash equivalents decreased million  reflecting net cash provided by operating activities of million  net cash used in investing activities of million primarily the results of the net increase in short term investments of million and purchases of property and equipment of million and net cash provided by financing activities of million 
net cash provided by financing activities was mainly related to proceeds from exercise of stock options 
as of december   the company had cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments of million and working capital of million compared to million and million  respectively  as of december  during the year ended december   cash and cash equivalents increased million  reflecting net cash provided by operating activities of million  net cash used in investing activities of million primarily the results of increased purchases of property and equipment of million offset by the net reduction in short term investments of million and net cash provided by financing activities of million 
net cash provided by financing activities was mainly related to proceeds from exercise of stock options 
capital commitments the company s business is very capital intensive  requiring significant amounts of capital to fund the acquisition of assets  particularly aircraft 
the company has historically funded the acquisition of its aircraft by entering into off balance sheet financing arrangements known as leveraged leases  in which third parties provide equity and debt financing to purchase the aircraft and simultaneously enter into long term agreements to lease the aircraft to the company 
see the discussion above in the recent developments and outlook section with respect to the company s present considerations regarding future deliveries 
similarly  the company often enters into long term lease commitments to ensure access to terminal  cargo  maintenance and other similar facilities 
as can be seen in the table below setting forth information as of december   these operating lease commitments are significant 
thereafter total in millions long term debt capital lease obligations 
guaranteed simulator usage commitments operating lease commitments   aircraft purchase commitments total contractual capital commitments   see note debt  note obligations under capital leases  note operating leases  and note commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these items 
between december  and march   the company accepted deliveries of crjs  and paid certain operating lease commitments 
as a result  as of march   the company s operating lease commitments were million for the remainder of  million for  million for  million for  and billion thereafter 
the company s aircraft purchase commitments were million for the remainder of and million for the company also has a variety of other long term contractual commitments that are of a nature that  under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  are not required to be reflected on the company s balance sheet  and that are not generally viewed as off balance sheet financing arrangements  such as commitments for major overhaul maintenance on the company s aircraft  and pilot training 
see liquidity and capital resources other commitments below and business pilot training above  and note summary of accounting policies l maintenance and note commitments and contingencies training in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these items 
the company believes that its cash balances and cash flow from operations together with operating lease financing and other available equipment financing will be sufficient to enable the company to meet its working capital needs  expected operating lease financing commitments  other capital expenditures  and debt service requirements for the remainder of however  the company s industry environment is highly uncertain and volatile at this time 
future events could affect the industry or the company in ways that are not presently anticipated that could adversely affect the company s liquidity 
other financing on september   the company entered into an asset based lending agreement with wachovia bank  na that initially provided the company with a line of credit for up to million 
as a result of the chapter bankruptcy filing by united airlines  it was necessary for the company to request a covenant waiver 
as a result of these negotiations  the company agreed to reduce the size of the lending agreement to million and revise certain covenants 
the line of credit  which will expire on october   carries an interest rate of libor plus 
to depending on the company s fixed charges coverage ratio 
the company has pledged million of this line of credit as collateral for letters of credit issued on behalf of the company by a financial institution 
the available borrowing under the line of credit is limited to the value of the bond letter of credit on the company s dulles  virginia hangar facility plus of the book value of certain rotable spare parts 
as of december  the value of the collateral supporting the line was sufficient for the amount of available credit under the line to be million 
there have been no borrowings on the line of credit 
the amount available for borrowing at december  was million after deducting million which has been pledged as collateral for letters of credit 
the company intends to request that its current line of credit be renewed upon expiration 
if it is unable to renew  the company believes it has adequate liquidity to pledge cash as collateral for letters of credit 
in september  approximately million of pass through certificates were issued in a private placement by separate pass through trusts  which purchased with the proceeds  equipment notes the equipment notes issued in connection with i leveraged lease transactions relating to four j s and six crjs  all of which were leased to the company the leased aircraft  and ii the financing of four j s owned by the company the owned aircraft 
the equipment notes issued with respect to the owned aircraft are direct obligations of aca  guaranteed by acai and are included as debt obligations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and in the table above 
the equipment notes issued with respect to the leased aircraft are not obligations of aca or guaranteed by acai 
aircraft the company has significant lease obligations for aircraft that are classified as operating leases and therefore are not reflected as liabilities on the company s balance sheet 
the remaining terms of such leases range from one to sixteen and three quarters years 
the company s total rent expense in under all non cancelable aircraft operating leases was approximately million 
as of december   the company s minimum annual rental payments for under all non cancelable aircraft operating leases with remaining terms of more than one year were approximately million 
in order to minimize the total aircraft rental expense over the entire life of the related aircraft leveraged lease transactions  the company has uneven semiannual lease payment dates of january and july for its crj and jet aircraft 
as of march   approximately of the company s annual lease payments for its crj and jet aircraft are due in july and are due in january the amounts due under and payment schedules for any aircraft lease financing entered into after march  may cause these amounts to change 
the company made lease payments for its crj and jet aircraft totaling million in january as of march   the company had a total of crjs on firm order from bombardier  inc  in addition to the already delivered  and held options for additional crjs 
the firm ordered aircraft include crjs that were ordered in july  after fairchild dornier gmbh fairchild  the manufacturer of the seat jet  opened formal insolvency proceedings in germany and rejected the company s purchase agreement covering jets the company had on firm order and under option 
the company s agreement with bombardier provides for crjs to be delivered during the remainder of and an additional crjs to be delivered by april  due to a number of factors  including the united bankruptcy  the effect on the operations of the airline industry of the war with iraq  and the state of the financing markets  the company and bombardier have agreed to delay by two weeks the scheduled delivery date of two aircraft originally scheduled for march deliveries 
the company is considering the delay of future deliveries and is engaged in discussions with bombardier regarding financing and the aircraft delivery schedule 
see the recent developments and outlook section above with respect to the company s present considerations regarding future deliveries 
the company relies on third party financing to pay for the crj aircraft it has ordered 
in order to realize the lowest lease rates  the company has utilized leveraged lease transactions 
in a leveraged lease  there is an equity source for of the purchase price and a debt source for the remaining 
with the uncertainty of united s future and industry conditions  the company has been unable to secure equity funding for any of its remaining firm ordered aircraft 
the company has been in discussions with the economic development corporation of canada edc to provide the debt financing for the ordered aircraft 
the company has a contingent commitment from edc for debt financing of four aircraft scheduled for delivery in april and may as a result of the bankruptcy of united  the obligation of the edc to fund any of the four aircraft is contingent upon the company obtaining a waiver from the edc 
since the united bankruptcy filing  through the date of this filing  the company has been successful in obtaining such waivers 
a crj was damaged in october as a result of being struck by a shuttle bus that was not operated by the company 
in addition  a crj was damaged in february as a result of snow accumulation on an improperly cleared runway 
it is anticipated that both aircraft will be out of operation through may of  and the company expects the repair costs on both aircraft to be covered by insurance proceeds 
the company does not currently anticipate the loss of use of these aircraft to have a material effect on its results of operations 
capital equipment and debt service in  the company anticipates capital spending of approximately million consisting of approximately million for rotable spare parts and flight equipment  million for ground and maintenance equipment  million for computer equipment  and million for other capital assets  and expects to finance these capital expenditures out of working capital 
principal payments on long term debt for are estimated to be approximately million reflecting borrowings related to the purchase of four crjs acquired in and and five j s acquired in and the foregoing amount does not include additional debt that may be required for the financing of new crjs  spare parts and spare engines 
other commitments the company s regional jet fleet is comprised of new aircraft with an average age of less than two and a half years 
since maintenance expense on new aircraft is lower in the early years of operation due to manufacturers warranties and the generally lower failure rates of major components  the company s maintenance expense for regional jet aircraft will increase in future periods 
in  the company executed a seven year engine services agreement with ge engine services  inc ge covering the scheduled and unscheduled repair of aca s crj jet engines  operated on the crjs already delivered or on order at that time for the united express operation 
this agreement was amended in july to cover additional crj aircraft  bringing the total number of crj aircraft covered under the agreement to under the terms of the agreement  the company pays a set dollar amount per engine hour flown on a monthly basis to ge and ge assumes the responsibility to repair the engines when required at no additional expense to the company  subject to certain exclusions 
the company s future maintenance expense on crj engines covered under the agreement will escalate based on contractual rate increases  intended to match the timing of actual maintenance events that are due pursuant to the terms 
the company expenses aircraft maintenance based upon the amount paid to ge under the agreement  as engine hours are flown 
to date  the time between scheduled repair work has been longer and therefore the costs of maintaining these engines has been lower than anticipated at the time the original contract and rates were agreed 
the company has been in negotiations with ge to reduce the base rate in the agreement to reflect the actual operating performance of the engines  to add the remaining ordered aircraft to the agreement  and to extend the term 
the company has disputed the appropriateness of certain contract rate adjustments and in the fourth quarter of sought other rate concessions from ge in the context of negotiating with ge for an adjustment in rates and for an extension of the contract to cover a longer term and to cover the remaining crj aircraft on order 
consistent with its understanding at the time  the company reduced the amounts it paid ge under the agreement and correspondingly reduced the amounts it expensed for engine maintenance 
the company continues to negotiate with ge and other vendors in order to reach an acceptable maintenance agreement 
accordingly  the company currently is not adding engines beyond the covered aircraft and anticipates that the adjustments described above will continue to be disputed 
the company recorded million  million  and million to maintenance expense in the second  third  and fourth quarters of  which represented the company s estimate of amounts that ge may seek to collect under the agreement 
in addition  the company believes that  if it so elects  it has the right to remove any or all engines from this agreement at any time 
ge does not agree with the company s interpretation of the agreement 
in february the company provided notice of its desire to settle this issue in arbitration 
ge subsequently presented an invoice for amounts it believes to be due from the company  which amounts are million in excess of the amounts accrued by the company  and requested that the question of the amounts due also be settled by arbitration 
the parties are presently negotiating whether an agreement can be reached outside of arbitration  as provided in the agreement 
if no agreement can be reached and the arbitration is decided in the company s favor  the company will remove the engines from the agreement and will negotiate for new terms at market rates 
a decision in ge s favor will result in covered engines remaining in the agreement for the balance of the term 
effective september  the company entered a sixteen year maintenance agreement with air canada covering maintenance  repair and overhaul services for airframe components on its crj aircraft 
under the terms of this agreement  the company pays a varying amount per flight hour each month  based on the age of the aircraft 
the company expenses the amount paid to air canada based on the rates stipulated in the agreement and the hours flown each month 
in february  the company entered into a five year agreement with air canada covering the scheduled airframe c check overhaul of its crj aircraft 
the company expenses this cost as the overhaul is completed

the company has entered into agreements with pan am international flight academy paifa  which allow the company to train crj  j and jet pilots at paifa s facility near washington dulles 
in  paifa relocated its washington dulles operations to a new training facility near the company s washington dulles headquarters 
this facility currently houses three crj simulators  a jet simulator  and a j simulator 
the company has agreements to purchase an annual minimum number of crj simulator training hours at agreed rates through the company s payment obligations for crj simulator usage over the remaining years of the agreements total approximately million 
in  paifa  cae schreiner and the company executed a simulator provision and service agreement providing for jet training at the paifa facility 
under this agreement  the company has committed to purchase all of its jet simulator time from paifa at agreed upon rates  with no minimum number of simulator hours guaranteed 
the company has committed to provide its senior executive officers a deferred compensation plan which utilizes split dollar life insurance policies  and for a certain officer  a make whole provision for income taxes  post retirement salary based on ending salary  and post retirement benefits based on benefits similar to those currently provided to the executive while actively employed 
the company has estimated the cost of the deferred compensation and tax gross up feature  future salary and future benefits and is accruing this cost over the remaining required service time of the executive officers 
in  the company expensed approximately million as the current year s cost of these benefits 
the company expects to recognize similar costs annually over the remaining required service life of the senior executives 
in  the company commenced a replacement project of its computer software systems covering financials  human resources  benefits  and maintenance 
the majority of these costs are being capitalized and amortized over seven years 
in  the company expensed approximately  related to replacement software selection and capitalized million in acquisition and implementation costs 
in  and  the company capitalized an additional million  million and million of costs incurred  respectively  bringing the total capitalized costs as of december  to million 
the company s board of directors has approved the repurchase of up to million of the company s outstanding common stock in open market or private transactions 
as of march  the company has repurchased  shares of its common stock and has approximately million remaining of the million authorized for repurchase 
inflation inflation has not had a material effect on the company s operations because the company s fee for service rates are adjusted annually under the terms of its agreements with united and delta 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the company s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires company management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
the us securities and exchange commission has defined a company s most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results  and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on this definition  the company has identified its critical accounting policies as including those addressed below 
the company also has other key accounting policies  which involve the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions 
see note summary of accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these items 
management believes that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable  based upon information presently available  however  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition under the proration of fare arrangement in effect with united until november of  the company recognized passenger revenue when a flight was completed 
this required various estimates about passenger fares and other factors that were subject to subsequent adjustment and settlement with united and other carriers 
following certain changes in estimates  which resulted in adjustments in as described in results of operations  the company does not expect any further adjustments attributable to the former proration of fare arrangement 
under the fee per departure and fee per block hour contracts currently in place with united and delta  respectively  revenue is the product of the agreed upon rate and the number of departures or the number of block hours flown 
rates are generally agreed to on an annual basis and are subject to adjustments upon certain specified events  such as changes in cities served or in aircraft utilization levels 
until rates are agreed to each year with united and delta or are adjusted in response to specified events  the company may be required to estimate these rates and record revenue based upon such estimates until final rates are agreed to by either united or delta 
in addition  certain incentive payments are recorded based upon the company s assessment of its satisfaction of operational performance criteria and are subject to review by united or delta 
major maintenance costs the company has executed long term agreements with the engine manufacturers and other service providers covering the repair and overhaul of its engines  airframe and avionics components  and landing gear 
these agreements generally include escalating rates per flight hour over the term of the agreement 
the escalating rates are intended to reflect the approximate actual maintenance cost increases as the aircraft age 
the company expenses costs based upon the current rate per hour and the number of aircraft and engines hours for the period 
as a result  maintenance costs for the company s existing aircraft fleet are expected to increase in future years 
aircraft leases the majority of the company s aircraft are leased from third parties 
in order to determine the proper classification of a lease as either an operating lease or a capital lease  the company must make certain estimates at the inception of the lease relating to the economic useful life and the fair value of an asset as well as select an appropriate discount rate to be used in discounting future lease payments 
these estimates are utilized by management in making computations as required by existing accounting standards that determine whether the lease is classified as an operating lease or a capital lease 
substantially all of the company s aircraft leases have been classified as operating leases  which results in rental payments being charged to expense over the terms of the related leases 
additionally  operating leases are not reflected in the balance sheet and accordingly  neither a lease asset nor an obligation for future lease payments are reflected in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
aircraft early retirement costs in determining the cost of the early retirement of leased aircraft and thus in determining the amount of the aircraft early retirement charge  the company must estimate  among other things  retirement date  market lease rates  future sub lease income  the cost of maintenance return provisions  future interest and inflation rates  and the duration and cost of aircraft storage 
the company generally does not accrue for the costs of retiring leased aircraft more than one year before the planned date of removal from service  considering the potential for changes in plans and associated costs 
as the associated leases may extend over several years  these costs estimates are subject to change 
any significant delays in the delivery of the remaining crjs on firm order could cause the actual retirement dates to differ materially from the planned retirement dates 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements 
this interpretation requires an existing unconsolidated variable interest entity to be consolidated by their primary beneficiary if the entity does not effectively disperse risk among all parties involved or if other parties do not have significant capital to finance activities without subordinated financial support from the primary beneficiary 
the primary beneficiary is the party that absorbs a majority of the entity s expected losses  receives a majority of its expected residual returns  or both as a result of holding variable interests  which are the ownership  contractual  or other pecuniary interests in an entity 
we do not expect the statement to have a significant impact on our financial position or operating results 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which amended sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation 
the new standard provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
additionally  the statement amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in the annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results
