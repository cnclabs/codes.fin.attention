for fiscal  total revenues increased to million from million in fiscal the increase for the year was due primarily to a increase in same store revenues and a increase in the average number of stores operated during fiscal versus fiscal the increase in same store revenues was the result of i continued growth of dvd rental and sales revenue  ii increases in the sales of previously viewed movies and previously played games  iii higher video game rental revenues driven by growth in the video game industry and consumer acceptance of new platforms released late in  and iv a favorable new movie release schedule in fiscal versus fiscal the revenue increase was partially offset by i a significant decline in rental revenue from vhs product due to the continued consumer transition to dvd  ii unfavorable weather during the first half of as compared to the first half of  iii the broadcast of the winter olympics during the first quarter of  and  iv an extra week of revenues totaling approximately million in fiscal in the first quarter of  we began reporting the sale of previously viewed rental inventory as rental revenue and the related cost as cost of rental revenue 
the sales and costs associated with previously viewed rental inventory were previously reported as product sales and cost of product sales  respectively 
the sales and costs of previously viewed rental inventory in prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation for comparative purposes 
the reclassifications had no impact on total revenues  gross margins or net income as previously reported 
additionally  the non cash cost unamortized book value of previously viewed rental inventory sold has been reclassified on the statement of cash flows to be reported with rental inventory amortization 
these costs were previously netted against purchases of rental inventory as investing activities in the statement of cash flows 
the current presentation is more consistent with the classification of these costs in the income statement and discloses the gross rental inventory purchases  before the write off of previously viewed inventory sold  on the face of the statement of cash flows 
the amounts reclassified on the statements of cash flows for fiscal and are as follows in thousands first quarter   second quarter   third quarter   four quarter   cost of sales 
the gross margin on rental revenue for fiscal was  versus in fiscal the cost of rental revenues includes the amortization of rental inventory  revenue sharing expenses incurred and the cost of previously viewed rental inventory sold 
the decrease in the gross margin on rental revenue was primarily due to a change in our amortization policy for rental inventory during the fourth quarter of fiscal see note to our consolidated financial statements and the initial investment in our game expansion program that took place in order to provide significant copy depth of all game platforms in our stores 
the decrease was partially offset by i the increasing shift of movie rentals from vhs to dvd  which currently has a lower cost structure than vhs and ii the purchase price allocation of video update that produced lower than normal rental inventory amortization in the first half of cost of product sales includes the costs of new videocassettes and dvds  concessions and other goods sold 
the gross margin on product sales increased to for fiscal from in fiscal the increase in profitability of product sales was due to the decreased level of lower margin  new movies available for sale in the first half of versus  coupled with deep discounts of certain new sales merchandise in the first quarter of to diminish levels of slow moving inventory 
however  the gross margin on product sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal reflects an expected trend of reduced margins due to our increased commitment to offer more new movies for sale 
operating costs and expenses 
store operating expenses  which include store level expenses such as lease payments and in store payroll  increased to of total revenue for fiscal from in fiscal the increase in store operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue was primarily due to a higher cost structure associated with the video update stores acquired in december and the benefits in fiscal of an extra week of revenues 
the increase was offset partially by i continued initiatives to reduce operating costs  ii strong performance of new stores  iii continued closure of under performing units  and iv the same store revenues increase of in fiscal general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal general and administrative expenses include a legal settlement charge of million in the second quarter of regarding our extended viewing fee policy and a charge of million related to an amendment of our supply agreement with rentrak corporation in the first quarter of these two items substantially offset the decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue which was achieved by leveraging general and administrative expenses against the increased revenues associated with the growth in our store base 
amortization of intangibles as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal was  a decrease from in fiscal this decrease was due to goodwill no longer being amortized pursuant to the adoption of fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  as of the beginning of fiscal stock option compensation expense represents the non cash charge associated with certain stock options that were repriced during the first quarter of fiscal and are subsequently accounted for as variable stock options under fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  an interpretation of apb opinion no 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
we expect to continue to record adjustments to income from stock option compensation in future periods 
interest expense includes fees for the unused borrowings available under our credit facility and amortization of the associated debt issue costs  as well as the costs of any outstanding borrowings under our credit facility  net of interest income 
interest expense as a percentage of total revenue decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to the repayment of all outstanding debt in may as a result of the impact of the above factors on revenues and expenses  operating income increased by in fiscal to million from million in fiscal the increase includes the benefit of lower stock option compensation expense in fiscal and was partially offset by the legal settlement charge and the charge to amend a supply contract 
pending the completion of final closing tax returns for video update  we had net operating loss carryforwards for income taxes at january  resulting from the video update acquisition see note to our consolidated financial statements of approximately million  with an million related valuation allowance 
based on the final tax returns for video update  at january  the net operating loss carryforward for income taxes was adjusted to approximately million in us loss carryforwards and million in foreign loss carryforwards that expire in years through we have recorded a valuation allowance of million related to our net deferred tax assets as we are uncertain as to whether sufficient taxable income will be generated to allow the net deferred tax assets to be fully realized 
fiscal year ended january  a week year compared to the fiscal year ended december  a week year revenue 
for fiscal  total revenues increased to million from million in fiscal the increase for the year was due primarily to a increase in same store revenues and an increase in the average number of stores open during fiscal versus fiscal the increase in revenues was the result of i significant increases in dvd rental revenue  ii an increase in the sales of previously viewed movies and previously played games  iii successful  chain wide internal marketing programs designed to generate more consumer excitement and traffic in our base of stores  iv a favorable new release schedule in the last half of the year  v an extra week of revenues totaling approximately million in fiscal  and vi additional revenues from the video update acquisition totaling approximately million in fiscal the revenue increase was partially offset by i soft game rentals through the third quarter of fiscal due to consumer anticipation of new game platforms being introduced late in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and ii a decline in new movie sales as a result of the liquidation of older sell through titles in certain stores during fiscal and into the first quarter of fiscal cost of sales 
the gross margin on rental revenue for fiscal was  versus in fiscal the cost of rental revenues includes the amortization of rental inventory  revenue sharing expenses incurred and the cost of previously viewed rental inventory sold during the period 
the improvement in the gross margin on rental revenue is a result of the increase in same store revenues and the benefit of stronger margins on dvd rentals versus vhs rentals due to the difference in purchasing models for these two formats 
the increase was achieved inclusive of a million reserve against previously viewed vhs inventory in the fourth quarter of fiscal see note to our consolidated financial statements 
cost of product sales includes the costs of new videocassettes and dvds  concessions and other goods sold 
the gross margin on product sales decreased to for fiscal from in fiscal the decrease in profitability of product sales was primarily a result of significant discounting associated with the continued liquidation of older sell through titles and other slow moving inventory in certain stores early in fiscal operating costs and expenses 
store operating expenses  which include store level expenses such as lease payments and in store payroll  decreased to of total revenue for fiscal from in fiscal the decrease in store operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue was primarily due to i the same store revenues increase of in fiscal  ii continued initiatives to reduce operating costs  iii strong performance of new stores  iv continued closure of under performing units  and v the benefits of an extra week of revenues in fiscal general and administrative expenses represented of total revenue in fiscal versus in fiscal the increase was the result of a million charge related to an amendment of our supply agreement with rentrak corporation in fiscal the increase was substantially offset by the revenue growth benefiting from an extra week of revenues in fiscal achieved with only minimal increases to administrative staffing levels 
amortization of intangibles as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal was  a decrease from in fiscal this decrease was primarily due to the increase in revenue and the expiration of significant levels of five year non compete agreements throughout fiscal as well as lower impairment charges in fiscal versus fiscal stock option compensation expense represents the non cash charge associated with certain stock options that were repriced during the first quarter of fiscal and are subsequently accounted for as variable stock options under fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  an interpretation of apb opinion no 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
we expect to record adjustments to income from stock option compensation in future periods 
as a result of the impact of the above factors on revenues and expenses  operating income increased by in fiscal to million from million in fiscal the increase was partially offset by the charge to amend a supply contract and stock option compensation expense 
general economic trends  quarterly results of operations and seasonality our business is subject to fluctuations in operating results due to a number of factors  many of which are outside of our control 
these fluctuations may be caused by  among other things the number  timing and performance of new or acquired stores  public acceptance of  interest in  and availability of  newly released movies  our mix of products rented versus sold  marketing programs and new release acquisition costs  seasonality compared to other months during the year  we experience peak revenues during the months of november  december and january due to the holidays in these months as well as inclement weather conditions 
additionally  revenues generally rise in the months of june  july and august when most schools are out of session  providing people with additional discretionary time to spend on entertainment  and special events  such as the olympics or ongoing major news events of significant public interest 
liquidity and capital resources our primary capital needs are for opening and acquiring new stores and for purchasing inventory 
other capital needs include refurbishing  remodeling and relocating existing stores and refreshing  rebranding and supplying new computer hardware for acquired stores 
we fund inventory purchases  remodeling  rebranding and relocation programs  new store opening costs and acquisitions primarily from cash flow from operations  proceeds from our recent common stock offering and  if necessary  loans under revolving credit facilities 
at january   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  no long term debt and million in available borrowings under our credit facility 
during fiscal we generated approximately million in adjusted ebitda  a increase over the prior year 
for fiscal  our adjusted ebitda increased to million  a increase over million in fiscal these increases were primarily driven by the revenue increases during those periods while achieving economies of scale within our expense structure 
adjusted ebitda is defined as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  non cash compensation and nonrecurring items  less our purchases of rental inventory which excludes rental inventory purchases specifically for new store openings 
adjusted ebitda is presented not as an alternative measure of operating results or cash flow from operations as determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  but because  in the home video specialty retail industry  it is a widely accepted financial indicator of a company s ability to incur and service debt assuming rental inventory is expensed upon purchase instead of being capitalized and amortized 
our calculation of adjusted ebitda is not necessarily comparable to reported ebitda and or adjusted ebitda of other companies due to the lack of uniform definitions of ebitda and adjusted ebitda 
see selected financial data in part ii  item of this form k for our calculation of adjusted ebitda 
we fund short term working capital needs  including the purchase of rental inventory  primarily through cash flow from operations 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
net cash provided by operating activities continues to be sufficient to cover rental inventory replenishment  capital resource and debt service needs 
net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase was due to increased acquisition activity and increased rental inventory purchases to support a larger store base  as well as significant increases in property  furnishings and equipment resulting from increased store activity for fiscal net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal resulting from the net proceeds of our stock offering  reduced by the repayment of amounts outstanding under our credit facility 
net cash used in financing activities was million and million in fiscal and  respectively  representing payments against our credit facility offset by proceeds from stock option exercises in fiscal and increased by the purchase and retirement of outstanding common stock in fiscal in may  we closed a public offering of our common stock priced at per share 
we sold  shares and received the proceeds from  stock options exercised in conjunction with the offering for total proceeds  net of expenses of the offering  of approximately million 
a portion of the proceeds from the offering was used to repay outstanding borrowings under the credit facility 
we are currently using the balance of the proceeds from the offering for new store openings  selective acquisitions  working capital and other general corporate purposes 
on june   we entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of banks  led by southtrust bank  with respect to a new revolving credit facility 
our credit facility is unsecured and  as amended  currently provides for borrowings of up to million through july  the interest rate on our credit facility is based on libor plus an applicable margin percentage  which depends on cash flow generation and borrowings outstanding 
in december  as required by the credit facility  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement in order to hedge exposure to interest rate fluctuations on million of outstanding debt at a fixed rate of plus an applicable margin percentage 
in may  we repaid all amounts outstanding under our credit facility with the proceeds from our stock offering and terminated the interest rate swap agreement 
the costs to terminate the interest rate swap were expensed and were immaterial to our results of operations 
we grow our store base through internally developed and acquired stores 
we opened internally developed stores during fiscal and expect to open between and new stores in we acquired stores during fiscal we will continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities in as they arise 
to the extent available  new stores and future acquisitions may be completed using funds available under our credit facility  financing provided by sellers  alternative financing arrangements such as funds raised in public or private debt or equity offerings or shares of our stock issued to sellers 
however  we cannot assure you that financing will be available to us on terms which will be acceptable  if at all 
effective december   we acquired of the newly issued common stock of the reorganized video update  inc under its plan of reorganization which was confirmed by the united states bankruptcy court on december  video update had been operating under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code since its voluntary bankruptcy filing on september  the acquisition of the newly issued common stock of video update was in satisfaction of all amounts owed to us by video update under a million debtor in possession financing agreement 
in addition  we purchased certain senior secured debt of video update in may for million  funded amounts due to secured and unsecured creditors in accordance with confirmation of the plan of reorganization totaling approximately million  and assumed other post bankruptcy filing liabilities of video update totaling approximately million 
video update operated video specialty stores in the united states and canada as of the time of the acquisition 
see note to our consolidated financial statements in december  our board of directors approved the expenditure of up to million for repurchases of our common stock 
we have not currently purchased any shares of our stock under this authorization 
at january   we had a working capital deficit of million  due to the accounting treatment of rental inventory 
rental inventory is treated as a noncurrent asset under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states because it is a depreciable asset and a portion of this asset is not reasonably expected to be completely realized in cash or sold in the normal business cycle 
although the rental of this inventory generates the major portion of our revenue  the classification of this asset as noncurrent results in its exclusion from working capital 
the aggregate amount payable for this inventory  however  is reported as a current liability until paid and  accordingly  is included in working capital 
consequently  we believe that working capital is not an appropriate measure of our liquidity and we anticipate that we will continue to operate with a working capital deficit 
the following table discloses our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of january  see notes and to our consolidated financial statements payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years after years credit facility outstanding operating leases      unconditional purchase obligations    total contractual cash obligations    the total commercial commitment under our credit facility is million  which expires on july  as of january   there were standby letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility of  of which  expired on march  and  expires on june  we believe our projected cash flow from operations  cash on hand  borrowing capacity under our credit facility and trade credit will provide the necessary capital to fund our current plan of operations  including our anticipated new store openings and acquisition program  through fiscal however  to fund a major acquisition  or to provide funds in the event that our need for funds is greater than expected  or if the financing sources identified above are not available to the extent anticipated or if we increase our growth plan  we may need to seek additional or alternative sources of financing 
this financing may not be available on satisfactory terms 
failure to obtain financing to fund our expansion plans or for other purposes could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
our ability to fund our current plan of operations and our growth plan will depend upon our future performance  which is subject to general economic  financial  competitive and other factors that are beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that our business will continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to fund capital resource needs  cover the ongoing costs of operating the business and service any debt incurred in the future 
if we are unable to satisfy these requirements with cash flow from operations and cash on hand  we may be required to sell assets or to obtain additional financing 
we cannot assure you that any such sales of assets or additional financing could be obtained 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of the financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate the estimates that we have made 
these estimates have been based upon historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different conditions or using different assumptions 
we believe our most critical accounting policies include our policies with respect to rental inventory amortization  the recognition of extended viewing fee revenue  impairment of long lived assets  purchase price allocation of acquired businesses and deferred income taxes 
a major component of our cost structure is based upon the method by which we amortize our rental inventory 
rental inventory is amortized to an estimated salvage value over an estimated useful life of up to two years 
we amortize the cost of rental inventory using an accelerated method designed to approximate the rate of revenue recognition 
this method is dependent upon the net realizable value of our inventory and the demand patterns of the rental products we provide 
in the fourth quarter of  we made a strategic decision to make a portion of our base stock vhs rental inventory available for sale as previously viewed inventory during the holiday period 
the sale of base stock vhs rental inventory was designed to make room on our store shelves for a significant investment in base stock dvd rental inventory to arrive in stores in the first quarter of our decision to make this investment in base stock dvd was primarily driven by the continued growth in consumer acceptance of the dvd platform in our core markets throughout the last year 
dvd rental revenue represented approximately of movie rental revenue as of the end of fiscal versus approximately as of the end of fiscal as a result of the significant shift from vhs to dvd that will occur in our rental inventory base as the new product arrives  we changed the estimates used to amortize rental inventory 
the revised estimates reflect a reduction in the estimated useful lives of the rental inventory and a reduced salvage value for both vhs and game inventory 
we believe the revised estimated useful lives and salvage values are better matched to our current rental business and are consistent with industry trends 
the changes in our estimates for rental inventory amortization have been applied to all inventory held at october  the changes have been accounted for as a change in accounting estimate during the fourth quarter ended january  the change in estimate decreased rental inventory and increased depreciation expense for the fiscal year ended january  by approximately million and reduced net income by million  or per diluted share 
the impact of the change is net of a million reserve against rental inventory that was established in the fourth quarter of in order to reflect the impact of the consumer transition to dvd on the sale prices of previously viewed vhs product 
we recognize revenue from extended viewing fees that we charge our customers for keeping our rental products beyond the initial rental period on a cash basis when the extended viewing fees are collected from the customer 
if we recognized extended viewing fee revenue on an accrual basis  results of operations would reflect increased income for extended viewing fee revenue offset by an accrual to reserve for uncollectible accounts 
we assess the fair value and recoverability of our long lived assets  including property  furnishings and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives  whenever events and circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition 
in doing so  we make assumptions and estimates regarding future cash flows and other factors to make our determination 
the fair value of our long lived assets is dependent upon the forecasted performance of our business  changes in the video retail industry  the market valuation of our common stock and the overall economic environment 
when we determine that the carrying value of our long lived assets may not be recoverable  we measure any impairment based upon the excess of the carrying value that exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets 
we have not recognized any impairment losses on long lived assets in fiscal  or if we do not meet our operating forecasts or if the market value of our stock declines significantly  we may have to record impairment charges not previously recognized 
we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis 
additionally  goodwill is tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of an entity below its carrying value 
these events or circumstances would include a significant change in the business climate  legal factors  operating performance indicators  competition  sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business or other factors 
we recorded impairment losses of   and in fiscal  and  respectively 
if we do not meet our operating forecasts or if the market value of our stock declines significantly  we may have to record additional impairment charges not previously recognized 
we estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities of acquired businesses based on historical experience and available information at the acquisition date 
we engage independent valuation specialists to assist when necessary 
if information becomes available subsequent to the acquisition date that would materially impact the valuation of assets acquired or liabilities assumed in business combinations  we may be required to adjust the purchase price allocation 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based upon historical losses  projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
as a result of this review  we have established a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets related to the estimated utilization of the net operating losses resulting from the video update acquisition 
related party transactions we hold a one third interest in echo  llc  a supply sales and distribution company 
we purchase office and store supplies and other business products from echo 
this relationship enables us to substantially reduce the retail mark up that occurs between the wholesaler and the retailer 
we paid echo approximately  and  during fiscal and  respectively  and received distributions totaling  in fiscal we have a  outstanding line of credit due from echo 
we have received approximately  and  in interest on the line of credit during fiscal and  respectively 
we had outstanding accounts payable to echo of approximately  and  as of january  and january   respectively

we had outstanding accounts payable to aca of approximately  and  as of january  and january   respectively 
j

in february  we entered into a lease with mel  llc for approximately  square feet of retail space in an existing shopping center to relocate one of our stores in dothan  alabama 
our chairman of the board  president and chief executive officer holds a one third interest in mel  llc 
the initial lease term is five years with three  three year renewal options 
the lease payments required under the initial five year term of the lease total approximately  the terms of this lease are more favorable than the terms available for the previous location 
each of these transactions is incurred in the normal course of business and purchases are pursuant to our established standard purchasing policies and practices 
we believe that the terms of all transactions described above are no less favorable than terms that could have been obtained from third parties
