same store sales for company owned units increased for fiscal no units were sold to franchisees refranchised during the year 
rti system wide sales increased in fiscal for ruby tuesday concept only due to growth in the number of restaurants and an increase in average unit volumes 
offsetting the increase in the ruby tuesday concept was the sale of all american cafe  l n seafood  and tia s tex mex restaurants to srg in fiscal total company revenues increased in fiscal  due to growth in number of restaurants  higher average unit volumes  and an increase of in same store sales  offset by the refranchising of ruby tuesday restaurants in fiscal and the sale of units to srg 
fiscal s revenues included weeks of revenue from american cafe  l n seafood  and tia s tex mex restaurants million  which were sold to srg on november  fiscal s increase in same store sales was driven primarily by higher check average resulting from a change in menu mix 
franchise revenue is recognized when we have performed all material services and the restaurant has opened for business 
franchise revenue  which includes royalty  development and operating agreement fees  increased to million  and to million in fiscal and  respectively 
the increases are primarily attributable to growth of the domestic franchise partnership program

back to table of contents overview during fiscal  we opened ruby tuesday restaurants

each of these restaurants was closed as part of upgrading our portfolio of restaurants 
during fiscal  we opened ruby tuesday restaurants three of which were acquired from a franchise partnership 
sold or closed the following restaurants were sold to three new franchise partnerships for million  of which million was received in cash with the remaining balance in the form of notes payable to us due through fiscal bearing interest at a rate of the sale of these restaurants resulted in a pre tax loss of million which is included in other restaurant operating costs  one was sold to an existing franchise partnership for million in exchange for a promissory note payable to us bearing interest at this note was paid in fiscal  five were closed due to lease terminations  and five which were not meeting management s expectations were closed  two of the five were among those acquired from the arizona franchise partnership in fiscal our franchisees have entered into development agreements whereby they commit to open a specified number of ruby tuesday restaurants in their assigned territories over a specific period of time 
in conjunction with development agreements  ruby tuesday franchise restaurants franchise partnership and eight traditional were opened during fiscal and ruby tuesday franchise restaurants franchise partnership and five traditional were opened during fiscal in addition  we refranchised restaurants to franchise partnerships in fiscal we currently do not have plans to refranchise any company owned ruby tuesday restaurants over the next months 
impact of recently adopted accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin requires that upon issuance of a guarantee  the guarantor must disclose and recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee 
the initial recognition and measurement requirement of fin is effective for guarantees issued or modified after december  as of june   we did not have any guarantees that were issued or modified after december  we have adopted the disclosure requirements of fin for fiscal see note to the consolidated financial statements 
although certain guarantees in existence at june  will be modified in fiscal  most notably the million credit facility for our franchise partnerships  we do not expect these modifications to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements due to the upcoming adoption of fin which will require us to record all third party franchise partnership debt in our consolidated balance sheet 
guarantee liabilities and the related expense  if any  to be recorded in rti s balance sheets will be eliminated upon consolidation of the franchise partnerships 
in january  the emerging issues task force issued eitf  accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor  which states that cash consideration received from a vendor is presumed to be a reduction of the prices of the vendor s products or services and should  therefore  be characterized as a reduction of cost of merchandise when recognized in our consolidated statements of income 
that presumption is overcome when the consideration is either a reimbursement of specific  incremental  identifiable costs incurred to sell the vendor s products  or a payment for assets or services delivered to the vendor 
eitf is effective for arrangements entered into after december  the company has chosen to adopt the new requirements prospectively rather than restate previous periods 
the impact of the new standard in fiscal was a reduction to income of million

pre tax income pre tax income increased million in fiscal to million 
excluding the loss on the srg note receivable in fiscal  pre tax income for fiscal increased million  or 
the reported increase was due to an increase in revenues due to growth in the number of units  higher average unit volumes  and increased franchising revenues  and a reduction  as a percentage of revenues  of cost of merchandise  other restaurant operating costs  and selling  general and administrative expenses as discussed below as well as the prior year loss on valuation of the srg note 
pre tax income decreased million in fiscal to million from fiscal due to the loss on valuation of the srg note as discussed above 
excluding this one time charge  pre tax income increased million  or  from fiscal the increase is due to positive same store sales for the ruby tuesday concept  increased franchising support service fees and interest income  and a reduction  as a percentage of revenues  of cost of merchandise  other restaurant operating costs  depreciation and amortization and selling  general and administrative expenses  as discussed below 
cost of merchandise cost of merchandise  as a percentage of restaurant sales  decreased in fiscal due to increased volume discounts and declining food costs with the rollout of a new menu in march of this year 
for fiscal  cost of merchandise decreased  as a percentage of restaurant sales  due to lower red meat and rib costs coupled with the implementation of a new food cost theoretical system designed to significantly reduce food waste 
in addition  vendor rebates and volume discounts increased due to favorable price negotiations 
payroll and related costs payroll and related costs increased as a percentage of restaurant sales in fiscal due to a continued focus on staffing levels and additional training costs incurred in transitioning units to our current service initiatives 
higher worker s compensation claims expense also contributed to the increase in payroll and related costs 

back to table of contents for fiscal  payroll and related costs increased  as a percentage of restaurant sales  due to higher hourly labor resulting from increased staffing levels offset by corresponding decreased overtime 
other increases included higher health insurance expenses 
other restaurant operating costs other restaurant operating costs  as a percentage of restaurant sales  decreased in fiscal primarily due to the refinancing of the bank financed operating lease agreements with traditional bank debt and corresponding purchase of the underlying properties  which resulted in rent expense for the operating leases being replaced by interest and depreciation expense for the owned units  lower closing expense due in part to fewer closings in fiscal and lower asset impairment charges in comparison to the prior fiscal year 
for fiscal  other restaurant operating costs  as a percentage of restaurant sales  decreased due to lower utilities as a result of favorable weather and market conditions  the prior year sale of restaurants to srg srg restaurants ran higher occupancy costs than ruby tuesday concept restaurants and decreased repairs expense due to cost efficiencies resulting from the increased use of maintenance contracts 
offsetting these decreases is an increase in lease expense which resulted from increased use of the bank financed operating lease program during fiscal depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization  as a percentage of restaurant sales  increased in fiscal as a result of the acquisition of properties previously leased which resulted from the refinancing of the bank financed operating leases with traditional bank debt 
for fiscal  depreciation and amortization  as a percentage of restaurant sales  decreased as a result of higher average unit volumes  increased use of our bank financed operating lease program and the prior year sale of restaurants to srg  which ran higher depreciation as a percentage of sales than ruby tuesday concept restaurants 
loss on srg note receivable during fiscal  rti recorded a loss on the srg note receivable of million 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we wrote off the srg promissory note due to a number of factors all relating to srg s declining operating performance and the receipt of notification on april  from srg s senior lender that note payments due to us were to be halted as a result of srg s covenant defaults 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of total revenues  decreased in fiscal the decrease is attributable to higher average unit volumes coupled with higher support service fees from franchise partnerships and srg 
we provide these services to our franchise partnerships and srg for a fee 
support service fee income totaled million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
these fees are recorded as a contra expense to selling  general and administrative expenses as the related costs to provide these services are included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
other decreases include lower equipment rent due to the buyout of certain computer leases and lower information technology costs due to bringing unit level technology costs in house 
for fiscal  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased  as a percentage of total revenues  which is attributable to higher average unit volumes coupled with higher support service fees from franchise partnerships and srg 
equity in earnings of unconsolidated franchises for fiscal  our equity in the earnings of unconsolidated franchises increased to million from million in fiscal  due to increased earnings attributable to our owned franchise partnerships coupled with the earnings attributable to four partnerships in which we acquired an additional equity interest in fiscal our agreements with franchise partners allow us to purchase an additional equity interest for million 
we have chosen to exercise that option in situations in which we expect to earn a return similar to or better than that which we expect when we invest in new restaurants 
in fiscal and  we exercised our right to acquire an additional equity interest in four franchise partnerships bringing our total ownership of each of those franchisees to 
as of the end of fiscal  the company held a interest in nine franchise partnerships collectively operating ruby tuesday restaurants 

back to table of contents net interest expense income net interest expense increased million in fiscal primarily due to the credit facility entered into in the first quarter to refinance the bank financed operating leases and the private sale in the fourth quarter of company notes in the amount of million 
in addition  interest income decreased in fiscal due to the write off of the srg note in the fourth quarter of fiscal see the borrowings and credit facilities section of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for more information on these two transactions 
for fiscal  net interest income increased million to million primarily due to additional notes receivable relating to refranchising 
in accordance with the original terms of the promissory notes see note to the consolidated financial statements  million of this interest was not received in cash in fiscal as initial cash payments of interest were deferred one to three years 
the amount of interest recorded as income but not received in cash decreased to million in fiscal as the number of franchisees contractually required to pay interest increased 
provision for income taxes the effective tax rate for fiscal was  down from in fiscal  excluding the tax impact of the loss on the srg note receivable 
the change in the effective rate was primarily due to an increase in tax credits during fiscal the effective income tax rate including the loss on the srg note receivable  which is deducted at statutory rates  was in fiscal the effective tax rate for fiscal  excluding the effect of the loss on the srg note receivable  was  down from in fiscal the change in the effective rate was due to tax saving strategies implemented in fiscal earnings per share diluted our long term goal for diluted earnings per share growth is in the to range per year 
excluding the loss on the srg note receivable in fiscal  earnings per share grew in fiscal earnings per share including the one time charge grew 
liquidity and capital resources rti s cash from operations and excess borrowing capacity allow us to pursue our growth strategies and targeted capital structure 
accordingly  we have established well defined priorities for our operating cash flow invest wisely in new assets and maintain our commitment to high return  low risk growth to increase profitability 
continue to make investments in our team members and our existing assets in order to provide superior guest and team satisfaction 
repurchase our common stock in order to maintain our target capital structure and return excess capital to our shareholders and provide further capital return to our shareholders through our dividend  started in fiscal on july   a transaction occurred which significantly changed the complexion of our balance sheet 
on that date  we refinanced all of our bank financed operating lease obligations with traditional bank debt 
this was done because we believe that the negative commentary associated with these bank financed operating leases  also called synthetic leases  was hurting our shareholder value 
for a complete understanding of that transaction  please see note to the consolidated financial statements 

back to table of contents sources and uses of cash our primary source of liquidity is cash provided from operations 
principal uses of cash are capital expenditures  share repurchases  payments on debt  and dividends 
the following table presents a summary of our cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities for fiscal and in thousands 
net cash provided by operating activities   net cash used by investing activities   net cash used by financing activities   net decrease increase in cash and short term investments  cash provided by operating activities increased million in fiscal primarily due to higher net income and with higher depreciation expense offset by lower losses on impairment and disposition of assets 
investing activities used an additional million in fiscal due to increased property and equipment purchases with cash from operations and the reduction in proceeds from refranchising due to the fiscal sale of restaurants to franchise partnerships  which resulted in the receipt of million in proceeds 
financing activities used million less in fiscal due primarily to less stock repurchases than fiscal further information regarding our consolidated cash activity for fiscal   and is presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
on july   we refinanced all of our bank financed operating leases with traditional bank debt in a non cash transaction 
in addition  we completed the private placement sale of million of senior notes on april  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the combination of capital spending  dividend payments and share repurchases for fiscal and beyond may require funding from our bank facilities discussed below 
the nature  extent  and timing of our external financing needs will vary depending upon our evaluation of existing market conditions and other economic factors 
our working capital deficiency and current ratio as of june  was million and  respectively 
as is common in the restaurant industry  we carry current liabilities in excess of current assets because cash a current asset generated from operating activities is reinvested in capital expenditures a long term asset and receivable and inventory levels are generally not significant 
capital expenditures we require capital principally for new restaurant construction  equipment replacement  and remodeling of existing restaurants 
property and equipment expenditures purchased primarily with internally generated cash flows for fiscal were million 
an additional million of property was acquired in fiscal in a non cash transaction when the company unwound its bank financed operating leases 
during the year  restaurants were opened 
consolidated capital expenditures for fiscal are budgeted to be approximately to million 
of this amount approximately million is expected to be spent by rti s franchise partnerships which will then be included in rti s consolidated financial statements as a result of the adoption of fin these franchise partnerships are separate legal entities 
some of the larger franchise partnerships may choose to fund capital expenditures primarily with cash provided by operations 
other franchisees may borrow under facilities without any involvement from rti 
the smallest of rti s franchise partnerships in certain instances fund capital expenditures through financing programs in which rti provides a partial guarantee 
the remaining portion of capital expenditures million to million is attributable to rti  the legal entity 
we intend to fund capital expenditures for company owned restaurants with cash provided by operations 
planned company owned ruby tuesday openings are expected to be approximately restaurants 
franchise partnerships are projected to open to restaurants 
traditional domestic and international franchisees are projected to open eight to ten restaurants

back to table of contents pension plans funded status the company is a sponsor of the morrison restaurants inc retirement plan the retirement plan  along with entities acquired by piccadilly cafeterias  inc piccadilly and compass group  plc compass 
piccadilly and compass each bought companies formerly spun off by morrison restaurants inc  the entity now known as ruby tuesday  inc 
the retirement plan was established to provide retirement benefits for qualifying employees of morrison restaurants inc under the retirement plan  participants are entitled to receive benefits based upon salary and length of service 
the retirement plan was amended as of december   so that no additional benefits will accrue and no new participants may enter the retirement plan after that date 
certain responsibilities involving the administration of the retirement plan are jointly shared by each of the three companies 
the sponsors have agreed to voluntarily contribute such amounts as are necessary to provide assets sufficient to meet benefits to be paid to participants 
for fiscal  rti made total contributions of million 
rti contributions to the retirement plan for fiscal are projected to be million 
to the best of our knowledge  both of the other sponsors have made all required contributions 
as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements  rti also sponsors two additional non funded pension plans  the executive supplemental pension plan and the management retirement plan 
although these plans are legally considered to be unfunded  the company does provide a source for the payment of benefits under these two plans in the form of company owned life insurance policies 
the cash value of these policies net of policy loans was million at june  the management retirement plan was amended effective june  such that no additional benefits would accrue and no new participants may enter the plan after that date 
as of our march  measurement date  these three plans had a total projected benefit obligation pbo of million  and an accumulated benefit obligation abo of million 
the combined fair value of plan assets  including the company owned life insurance policies and a contribution of million made to the retirement plan after the measurement date but before june   was million 
as a result of the underfunded status of the three plans relative to the combined pbo  we have recorded a million charge to shareholder s equity net of tax of million as of june  the pbo and abo reflect the actuarial present value of all benefits earned to date by employees 
the pbo incorporates assumptions as to future compensation levels while the abo reflects only current compensation levels 
due to the relatively long time frame over which benefits earned to date are expected to be paid  our pbo and abo are highly sensitive to changes in discount rates 
we measured our pbo and abo using a discount rate of at march  due to recent stock market declines  our retirement plan assets have experienced losses in value in fiscal and fiscal totaling million and million  respectively 
because of these declines  we changed our expected long term rate of return on plan assets from to in fiscal we believe that this assumption is appropriate given the composition of our plan assets and historical market returns thereon 
this change resulted in the recognition of approximately million in incremental expense 
we will continue to use the expected rate of return on plan assets assumption for the determination of pension expense in fiscal the losses our plan assets have experienced  along with the decrease in discount rates and mortality assumption changes have largely contributed to the unamortized actuarial loss of million in our three plans as of march  
back to table of contents in total  we expect pension expense to increase approximately million in fiscal we have incorporated this incremental expense into our annual budgets and outlook 
we do not believe that the underfunded status of the three pension plans will materially affect our financial position or cash flows in fiscal or future years 
given current funding levels and discount rates we would anticipate making contributions to more fully fund the pension plans over the course of the next five to ten years 
we believe our cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to allow us to make necessary contributions to the three plans 
we have included known and expected increases in our pension expense as well as future expected plan contributions in our operating plans and outlook 
see special note regarding forward looking information 
significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments long term financial obligations were as follows as of june  in thousands significant contractual obligations see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
borrowings and credit facilities on july   we entered into a transaction to refinance all of our bank financed operating lease obligations and our revolving credit facility prior revolver with traditional bank debt 
the revolving credit and term loan agreement the agreement consisted of approximately million revolving credit facility and approximately million term loan 
the million term loan was scheduled to mature in october and was paid off with the proceeds of the private placement discussed below 
the revolving credit facility includes a million current credit line swing line and a million letter of credit sub facility 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at various rate options to be chosen by the company 
on april   we entered into a private sale of million of non collateralized senior notes the private placement 
the private placement consisted of million of notes with a fixed interest rate of the series a notes and million of notes with a fixed interest rate of the series b notes 
the series a notes and series b notes mature on april  and april   respectively 
in addition to paying off the term loan portion of the agreement  the proceeds from the private placement were used to pay down million of the revolving credit balance outstanding 
at june   we had borrowings of million on the revolving credit facility of the agreement with an associated floating rate of 
at june   we had no borrowings on the prior revolver 

back to table of contents during fiscal  three of our five interest rate swap agreements expired 
the remaining two interest rate swap agreements total million 
these swap agreements fix the interest rate on an equivalent amount of our floating rate obligations to rates ranging from to  plus applicable margin ranging from to  for periods up through december  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the interest rate swaps continue to hedge our exposure to interest rate risk associated with our floating rate obligations 
during fiscal  we expect to fund operations  capital expansion  any repurchase of common stock  and the payment of dividends from operating cash flows  our revolving credit facility  and operating leases 
as previously noted our franchise partnerships will separately fund their own operations and capital expansion 
this funding likely will include sources beyond those listed for rti  the legal entity  such as other bank debt 
see special note regarding forward looking information 
total long term debt including current maturities and short term borrowings increased a net million in fiscal primarily due to the refinancing of our bank financed operating lease agreements with traditional bank debt during the first quarter of this fiscal year as discussed above 
guarantee of indebtedness of others since  our franchise partnerships have been offered a credit facility for which we provide a partial guarantee 
the current credit facility  which has been negotiated with various lenders  is a million credit facility to assist franchise partnerships with operational cash flow requirements 
rti also has an arrangement with a different third party lender whereby we may choose  at our sole discretion  to partially guarantee up to million in total specific loans for new restaurant development 
guarantees under this program are 
should payments be required under this guaranty  rti has certain rights to acquire the operating restaurants after the third party debt is paid 
as of june   the amounts we guaranteed under these two programs were million and million  respectively see note to the consolidated financial statements 
also noted in note to the consolidated financial statements are rti s guarantee arrangements with morrison fresh cooking  inc mfc and morrison health care  inc mhc 
these guarantees arose in when our shareholders approved the distribution the distribution of mfc s and mhc s businesses 
contingent liabilities existing from these guarantees include payments due mfc and mhc employees retiring under two non qualified defined benefit plans  which existed at the time of the distribution  and for payments due on eight named worker s compensation and general liability claims 
these contingent liabilities  which are estimated at june  to be million and million  respectively  do not have expiration dates 
should any payments be required under these contingent liabilities  rti would split the amounts due equally with the other non defaulting entity 
dividends during fiscal  our board of directors approved a dividend policy as an additional means of returning capital to rti s shareholders 
this policy calls for payment of semi annual dividends of per share 
in accordance with this policy  we paid dividends of million in fiscal the payment of a dividend in any particular future period and the actual amount thereof remain  however  at the discretion of the board of directors and no assurance can be given that dividends will be paid in the future 
see special note regarding forward looking information 
additionally  our credit facilities contain certain limitations on the payment of dividends 

back to table of contents critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require us to make subjective or complex judgments that may affect the reported financial condition and results of operations 
we base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be relevant in the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we continually evaluate the information used to make these estimates as our business and the economic environment changes 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful notes the allowance for doubtful notes represents our best estimate of losses inherent in the notes receivable at the balance sheet date 
the allowance for doubtful notes is increased by the amount of any gain not received in cash in refranchising transactions  and reduced by receivables charged off and reduced or increased by any adjustments which result from our review of its adequacy 
the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful notes is determined based on reviews and evaluations of specific notes and current economic conditions 
factors considered when reviewing specific notes include sales trends  debt covenant trends  additional borrowing capacity  as well as management judgment about the quality of operations 
interest income on notes receivable we recognize interest income on notes receivable when earned which sometimes precedes collection 
a number of our franchise partnership notes allow for the deferral of interest during the first one to three years 
it is our policy to cease accruing interest income and recognize interest on a cash basis when we determine that the collection of interest or principal is doubtful 
of the million interest income recognized in fiscal  million has not yet been received because it contractually is not due 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our notes receivable 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate our long lived assets for impairment at the individual restaurant level 
we review underlying assets related to each restaurant for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable such as when we decide to close a restaurant or when we have restaurants with recurring negative cash flow 
impairments are recognized when the sum of each restaurant s estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the book value of the restaurant 
in order to determine the amount of an impairment loss  we review future cash flows including those which would arise from salvage value 
in the instance of a potential refranchising transaction  the expected purchase price is used as the estimate of fair value 
impairment write downs are determined accordingly 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding asset impairments 
self insured casualty losses we record our best estimate of the remaining cost to settle incurred self insured casualty claims 
the estimate is based on the results of an independent actuarial study and considers historical claims frequency and severity as well as changes in factors such as our business environment  benefit levels  medical costs and the regulatory environment that could impact overall self insurance costs 
income taxes we record reserves for estimates of probable settlements of federal and state tax audits 
at any one time  many tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions 
the results of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may affect the ultimate settlement of these issues 
our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings  changes in the expected outcome of audits or changes in the decisions regarding deferred tax valuation allowances 

back to table of contents known events  uncertainties and trends financial strategy and stock repurchase plan our financial strategy is to utilize a prudent amount of debt  including operating leases  to minimize the weighted average cost of capital while allowing financial flexibility and the equivalent of an investment grade bond rating 
this strategy allows us to repurchase rti common stock at times when cash flow exceeds capital expenditures and other funding requirements 
during fiscal  we purchased million shares of rti common stock for a total purchase price of million 
the total number of remaining shares authorized to be repurchased  as of june   is million 
to the extent not funded with cash from operating activities  additional repurchases  if any  may be funded by borrowings on the credit facilities 
franchising and development agreements as of june   rti held a equity interest in nine franchise partnerships 
subsequent to june   we acquired an additional equity interest in four franchise partnerships for million each 
three of these acquisitions occurred on june  and the fourth acquisition was effective july  as a result of these transactions  the company now holds a equity interest in franchise partnerships which collectively operated ruby tuesday restaurants as of june  we may choose to exercise our rights to acquire an additional equity interest in additional franchise partnerships later in fiscal see special note regarding forward looking information 
disclosures about market risk we manage our exposure to changes in short term interest rates  particularly to reduce the impact on floating rate lease or debt obligations  by entering into interest rate swap agreements 
these agreements are with high credit quality commercial banks 
consequently  credit risk  which is inherent in all swaps  has been minimized to a large extent 
interest expense is adjusted for the difference to be paid or received as interest rates change 
during fiscal  our interest rate swaps required us to pay the banks million  million of which we charged to interest expense because the fixed rates we paid were higher than current floating market rates 
the remaining portion was charged to rent expense as the swaps were designated as hedging floating rate lease obligations prior to july a hypothetical basis point increase or decrease in short term interest rates would have an impact on annual pre tax earnings of million during the last two quarters of fiscal since our floating rate debt million at june  is hedged by the interest rate swaps during the first two quarters of the upcoming year 
these swaps million each expire on november and december  new accounting standards issued not yet adopted the accounting standard expected to have the most significant impact on rti is fin fin  which was issued by the fasb in january  addresses the consolidation of entities whose equity holders either a have not provided sufficient equity at risk to allow the entity to finance its own activities or b do not possess certain characteristics of a controlling financial interest 
fin requires the consolidation of these entities  known as variable interest entities vies  by the primary beneficiary of the entity 
the primary beneficiary is the entity  if any  that is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the vies activities  entitled to receive a majority of the vies residual returns  or both 
fin applies immediately to variable interests in vies created or obtained after january  for variable interests in a vie created before february   fin is applied to the vie no later than the end of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after june  fin requires certain disclosures in financial statements issued after january   if it is reasonably possible that the company will consolidate or disclose information about vies when fin becomes effective 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we plan to adopt fin at the beginning of fiscal fin s consolidation criteria are based on factors other than legal liability  and represent a significant and complex modification of previous accounting principles 
fin represents an accounting change  not a change in the underlying economics of independent and legally separate businesses 
under its provisions  the accounts of all of rti s franchise partnerships will be consolidated in the company s financial statements 
upon consolidation  we will not acquire any additional legal ownership  our legal rights and obligations will not change  and we will not become legally obligated for the franchisees liabilities 

back to table of contents we currently estimate the potential impact on our consolidated statement of income for fiscal will include a one time charge of approximately million net of taxes totaling million as a result of the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
we anticipate no additional dilutive impact on annual earnings per share in fiscal this is based on our current analysis of each franchise partnership s expected net income or loss and the related assignment of the net income or loss to the minority owners 
see special note regarding forward looking information 
a further description of the franchise partnership program to be consolidated is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas  which addresses the financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
the provisions of this statement are effective for the company beginning fiscal  with early application encouraged 
we do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
impact of inflation historically  we have been able to recover inflationary cost increases of items such as food and beverages through increased menu prices coupled with more efficient purchasing practices and productivity improvements 
competitive pressures may limit our ability to completely recover such cost increases 
historically  the effect of inflation on our net income has not been materially adverse 
management s outlook we continue to strategically position the company for growth through the continuing emphasis on our ruby tuesday brand and focus on our franchise partnership and other traditional domestic and international franchise programs 
we believe consolidation of the franchise partnership program will provide an even clearer picture of the performance of both our franchise partnership system as well as company owned operations
