table of contents critical accounting policies we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and to the understanding of our results of operations 
we discuss the impact and any associated risks on our results of operations related to these policies throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates include  but are not limited to customer cancellations  bad debts  inventories  investments  useful lives of long lived assets  intangible assets  income taxes  financing operations  warranty obligations  restructuring  pensions and other postretirement benefits  and contingencies and litigation 
our actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition we derive our revenue from the following sources sales  business services  rentals and financing  and support services in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  we recognize revenue from these sources as follows sales revenue sales of equipment we sell equipment to our customers  as well as to distributors and dealers re sellers throughout the world 
revenue from these sales is recognized upon the transfer of title  which is at the point of shipment 
we do not offer any rights of return or stock balancing rights 
our sales revenue from customized equipment and software enabled mail creation equipment and shipping products is generally recognized when installed 
sales of supplies revenue related to supplies is recognized at the point of title transfer  which is upon shipment 
software licenses and integration services we recognize revenue related to off the shelf software licenses upon transfer of title  which is upon shipment 
we recognize revenue from software requiring integration services at the point of customer acceptance 
business services revenue business services business services revenue includes revenue from pbms and psi 
management services  which includes outsourcing of mailrooms  copy centers  or other document management functions  are typically annual or longer contracts that contain a monthly service fee and in many cases a click charge based on the number of copies made  machines in use  etc 
revenue is recognized over the term of the agreement  based on monthly service charges  with the exception of the click charges  which are recognized as incurred 
presort mail services include the preparation  sortation and aggregation of mail to earn postal discounts and expedite delivery for our customers 
revenue is recognized over the term of the agreement as earned 

table of contents rentals revenue product rentals we rent equipment to our customers  primarily postage meters  mailing equipment and shipping systems under short term rental agreements  generally for periods of three months to three years 
we invoice in advance the charges for equipment rental 
we defer the billed revenue and include it initially in advance billings 
rental revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the rental agreement 
financing revenue product financing arrangements we provide lease financing of our products in the us and outside the us through sales type leases 
when a sales type lease is consummated  we record the gross finance receivable  unearned income and the estimated residual value of the leased equipment 
unearned income represents the excess of the gross finance receivable plus the estimated residual value over the sales price of the equipment 
we recognize the equipment sale at the inception of the lease 
we recognize unearned income as earned using the interest method over the term of the transaction 
earned income is included in rentals and financing revenue in the consolidated statements of income 
capital services revenue we provide financing for non pitney bowes equipment through direct financing leases and leveraged leases 
when a direct financing lease is consummated  we record the gross finance receivable  unearned income and the estimated residual value of the leased equipment 
unearned income represents the excess of the gross receivable plus the estimated residual value over the cost of the equipment 
we account for initial direct costs incurred in consummating a transaction as part of the investment in the lease and appropriately amortize these costs using the interest method over the term of the lease 
we recognize unearned income as earned using the interest method over the term of the transaction 
earned income is included in financing revenue in the consolidated statements of income 
from time to time  we sell selected finance assets 
we follow statement of financial accounting standards fas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  when accounting for our sale of finance assets 
we recognize all assets obtained or liabilities incurred in consideration as proceeds of the sale and recognize any gain or loss on the sale in earnings 
our investment in leveraged leases consists of rentals receivable net of principal and interest on the related nonrecourse debt  estimated residual value of the leased property and unearned income 
we recognize the unearned income as leveraged lease revenue over the lease term 
earned income is included in financing revenue in the consolidated statement of income 
support services revenue equipment maintenance agreements we provide support services to our customers primarily through extended maintenance contracts 
revenue related to these agreements is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the agreement 
multiple element arrangements certain of our transactions are consummated at the same time 
the usual form of this transaction involves the sale or lease of equipment  a cancelable meter rental and or a cancelable equipment maintenance agreement 
in these cases  fair value of the various elements is determined by using the residual method 
in applying this method  the fair values of any meter rental or equipment maintenance agreement are determined to be equivalent to the price charged in a standalone or renewal transaction 
any remaining consideration is allocated to the value of the equipment 
allowance for doubtful accounts we estimate our accounts receivable risks and provide allowances for doubtful accounts accordingly 
we believe that our credit risk for accounts receivable is limited because of the large number of our customers and the relatively small account balances for most of our customers 
also  our customers are dispersed across different businesses and geographic areas 
we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts is sufficient 

table of contents we evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts on a periodic basis 
our evaluation includes historical loss experience  adverse situations that may affect a customer s ability to repay  and prevailing economic conditions 
we make adjustments to our allowance if the evaluation of allowance requirements differs from the actual aggregate reserve 
this evaluation is inherently subjective because our estimates may be revised as more information becomes available 
allowance for credit losses we estimate our finance receivables risks and provide allowances for credit losses accordingly 
our financial services businesses establish credit approval limits based on the credit quality of the customer and the type of equipment financed 
we charge finance receivables through the allowance for credit losses after collection efforts are exhausted and we deem the account uncollectible 
our financial services businesses base credit decisions primarily on a customer s financial strength 
we believe that our concentration of credit risk for finance receivables in our internal financing division is limited because of our large number of customers  small account balances and customer geographic and industry diversification 
in addition  in our capital services programs  we may also consider collateral values 
our general policy for finance receivables contractually past due for over to days is to discontinue revenue recognition 
we resume revenue recognition when payments reduce the account to days or less past due 
in our capital services programs  we discontinue revenue recognition as soon as it is apparent that the obligor will not be making payments in accordance with lease terms  such as in the event of bankruptcy 
otherwise  we discontinue revenue recognition when accounts are over days past due 
we evaluate the adequacy of allowance for credit losses on a periodic basis 
our evaluation includes historical loss experience  the nature and volume of our portfolios  adverse situations that may affect a customer s ability to repay  estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions 
we make adjustments to our allowance for credit losses if the evaluation of reserve requirements differs from the actual aggregate reserve 
this evaluation is inherently subjective because our estimates may be revised as more information becomes available 
accounting for income taxes when we prepare our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we record this amount as a provision for our taxes in accordance with fas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this process requires us to make the following assessments we estimate our actual current tax liability in each jurisdiction 
we estimate our temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as lease revenue and related depreciation  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which we include within our consolidated balance sheet 
we then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and if we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
at any time  our provision for taxes could be impacted by changes in tax law and interpretations by governments or courts 
long lived assets long lived assets include property  plant and equipment we state property  plant and equipment at cost 
we depreciate property  plant and equipment principally using the straight line method over estimated useful lives machinery and equipment principally three to years and buildings up to years 
we capitalize major improvements which add to productive capacity or extend the life of an asset and we charge to expense as incurred repairs and maintenance 
we depreciate rental equipment on the straight line method over appropriate periods  principally three to ten years 
changes in regulatory provisions or technology may impact the useful lives of these assets 
we depreciate other depreciable assets using either the straight line method or accelerated methods 
we amortize properties leased under capital leases on a straight line basis over the primary lease terms 
we capitalize certain costs of internally developed software 
these costs include purchased materials and services  payroll and payroll related costs and interest costs 
we amortize internally developed software on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life  which is principally three to ten years 
we do not capitalize software development costs related to software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed due to the fact that the period between establishment and testing of a working model and the general availability of our software has historically been short and the related software development costs qualifying for capitalization in accordance with fas no 
accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed have been insignificant 

table of contents goodwill goodwill represents the excess of cost over the value of net tangible and other intangible assets acquired in business combinations 
goodwill acquired under business combinations completed prior to june  has been amortized  through december   using the straight line method over its estimated useful life  principally years 
goodwill acquired under business combinations completed after june  has not been amortized 
other intangible assets intangible assets with finite lives  acquired under business combinations  are amortized using the straight line method over estimated useful lives  principally five to years 
impairment review periodically  we assess the carrying value of our long lived and intangible assets 
our assessment involves comparing the carrying value of the asset on our consolidated balance sheet to the cash flows we expect to generate in the future by that asset 
we forecast the cash flows based on our assessment of our business 
if the expected cash flows are less than the asset s carrying value  we record an impairment charge on that asset 
we believe that we have no impairment to our assets as of december  however  future events and circumstances  some of which are described below  may result in an impairment charge changes in postal regulations governing the types of meters allowable for use 
however  recent regulations were issued in november  and therefore we do not expect new regulations for the foreseeable future 
new technological developments that provide significantly enhanced benefits over current digital technology significant negative economic or industry trends changes in our business strategy that alter the expected usage of the related assets significant increase or decrease in our cost of capital future terrorist or other actions that significantly impact the volume of mail future economic results that are below our expectations used in the current assessments

table of contents approximately million to increase our provision for credit losses related to our aircraft leasing investments in the us as a result of these events  combined with both the deteriorating financial condition in various other industries and the change in our capital services strategy  we also recorded a charge of approximately million to increase our provision for credit losses related to non aircraft leasing investments  including investments in the telecommunications industry 
a further breakdown of the charge related to aircraft lease investments by individual airline is presented on page meter transition in  we adopted a formal plan to transition to the next generation of networked mailing technology 
the information capture and exchange  made possible by advanced technology  turns the postage meter into an intelligent terminal that networks the mailer to postal and carrier information and systems 
this two way information architecture  in turn  enables convenient access to and delivery of value added services such as tracking  delivery confirmation and rate information 
the adoption of this plan was facilitated by our expanded access to technology and our ability to move to networked products combined with our expectations that the us and postal services around the world will continue to encourage the migration of mailing systems to networked digital technologies 
in connection with this plan  we recorded non cash pre tax charges of million for the year ended december   related to assets associated with our non networked mailing technology 
we have segregated these charges in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended december  in november  postal regulations were issued  consistent with our meter transition plan  defining the meter migration process and timing 
see regulatory matters 
restructuring charges in  we adopted a formal restructuring plan to implement a common  streamlined business infrastructure across the corporation as a result of our decisions to spin off our office systems business and align our mailing business on a global basis  as well as cost saving opportunities resulting from strategic acquisitions and partnerships  and additional benefits attained from the consolidation of our information technology organization and enterprise wide resource planning initiatives

table of contents capital services capital services strategy in  we took a number of strategic actions to transition our capital services business and reduce our overall exposure to long term external financing assets 
first  we liquidated about million of financing assets primarily related to assets held for sale 
second  we began a strategic analysis of our existing portfolio to develop the best disposition strategy 
finally  we decided to stop active pursuit of  and growth in  long term capital services financing transactions  including long term postal financing 
we will continue to provide lease financing for our products through our internal financing operations 
we believe that these actions will further position us for growth and maintain our financial flexibility 
as a result of these actions and the capital services charges discussed below  we estimate a reduction in earnings of approximately cents per diluted share 
additionally  the higher tax rate expected from lower capital services investments is estimated to reduce earnings by an incremental to cents per diluted share in capital services charges in  we recorded a non cash pre tax charge of approximately million  to write down our investments in commercial passenger aircraft leases primarily with us airways and united and to increase our provision for credit losses primarily related to aircraft leasing investments in the us see page for a further breakdown of this charge 
investment in commercial passenger and cargo aircraft leasing transactions at december   our net investment in commercial passenger and cargo aircraft leasing transactions was million  which is composed of transactions with us and foreign airlines of million and million  respectively 
this portfolio is diversified across airlines and aircraft and is financed through investments in leveraged lease transactions  direct financing lease transactions and through our equity investment in pbg capital partners llc pbg 
risk of loss under these transactions is primarily related to the inability of the airline to make underlying lease payments  our inability to generate sufficient cash flows either through the sale of the aircraft or secondary lease transactions to recover our net investment  and or in the case of the leveraged lease portfolio  the absence of an equity defeasance or other third party credit arrangements 
approximately of our remaining net investment in commercial passenger and cargo aircraft leasing investments is further secured by approximately million of equity defeasance accounts or third party credit arrangements 

table of contents at december   our net investment in commercial passenger and cargo aircraft leasing transactions was composed of the following aircraft net investment before charges write down of lease receivables and residuals additional credit loss reserves net investment airline us united and subsidiary a us airways b delta c america west american southwest northwest alaska federal express credit loss reserves foreign klm qantas japan air france lufthansa a our investment in commercial passenger aircraft leasing transactions with united included four aircraft leased to united and one aircraft leased to a wholly owned regional carrier subsidiary of united  for a total investment of approximately million 
in december  united filed for protection under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
we are currently in discussions with united as to whether we will continue leasing these aircraft to them post bankruptcy at reduced lease rates 
based on the expected outcome of these negotiations and the continued deterioration of the us airline industry  we recorded a charge of approximately million to write down lease receivables and residuals to reflect the estimated cumulative loss of future cash flows over the next nine years 
b prior to these charges and an exchange transaction as discussed below  our investment in commercial passenger aircraft leasing transactions with us airways included four aircraft for a total investment of approximately million 
in august  us airways filed for protection under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
to eliminate our exposure to us airways  in december  we exchanged the four aircraft leased to us airways  which were then valued at approximately million and paid approximately million in cash for a leased aircraft operated by federal express 
we recorded a charge of approximately million as a result of this transaction c we recorded a charge of approximately million to write down lease residuals on leases with delta airlines based on an assessment of the underlying leases and aircraft 
the write down of lease receivables and residuals of million and additional credit loss reserves of million include million and million  respectively  related to aircraft financed through our equity investment in pbg 

table of contents capital services portfolio our investment in capital services lease related assets included in our consolidated balance sheet was composed of the following december dollars in millions leveraged leases finance receivables other assets rental equipment total our investment in leveraged lease assets consists of the following december dollars in millions rental receivables residual value principal and interest on nonrecourse loans unearned income total leveraged leases the billion is the amount that is on our consolidated balance sheet 
rental receivables represent total lease payments from our customers over the remaining term of the leveraged leases 
residual value represents the value of the property anticipated at the end of the leveraged lease terms and is based on independent appraisals 
we regularly review the recorded residual value to ensure it is appropriate 
principal and interest on nonrecourse loans represent amounts due to unrelated third parties from our customers over the remaining term of the leveraged leases 
the nonrecourse loans are secured by the lessees rental obligations and the leased property 
if a lessee defaults and if the amounts realized from the sale of these assets are insufficient  we have no obligation to make any payments due on these nonrecourse loans to the unrelated third parties 
accordingly  we are required by generally accepted accounting principles to subtract the principal and interest over the remaining term of the nonrecourse loans from our rental receivables and residual value 
at december   the principal balances on the nonrecourse loans totaled billion and the related interest payments over the remaining terms of the leases totaled billion 
unearned income represents our future financing income that will be earned over the remaining term of the leases 
the billion investment in leveraged leases on our consolidated balance sheet is diversified across the following types of assets million related to commercial real estate facilities  with original lease terms ranging from to years 
million for postal equipment with international postal authorities  with original lease terms ranging from to years 
million related to locomotives and railcars  with original lease terms ranging from to years 
million related to nine commercial passenger and cargo aircraft  with original lease terms ranging from to years 
million for telecommunications equipment  with original lease terms ranging from to years 
million for rail and bus facilities with original lease terms ranging from to years 
million for shipping and handling equipment with an original lease term of years 
our leveraged lease investment in telecommunications equipment represents leases to three highly rated international telecommunication entities 
approximately percent of this portfolio is further secured by equity defeasance accounts or other third party credit arrangements 
additionally  our leveraged lease investment in commercial real estate facilities includes approximately million related to leases of corporate facilities to four us telecommunication entities  of which million is with lessees that are highly rated 
in addition  as part of our capital services charges discussed on page  we increased our provision for credit losses related to our investment in the telecommunications industry 
overall  approximately percent of our billion leveraged lease portfolio is further secured by equity defeasance accounts or other third party credit arrangements 
in addition  approximately percent of the remaining leveraged lease portfolio represents leases to highly rated government related organizations which have guarantees or supplemental credit enhancements upon the occurrence of certain events 

table of contents finance receivables are composed of the following dollars in millions december assets held for sale single investor leases large ticket single investor leases imagistics lease portfolio total we expect to phase out our assets held for sale portfolio by the end of our consolidated statements of income includes financing revenue of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  attributable to our assets held for sale portfolio 
other assets represent our equity interest in pbg 
see off balance sheet items for a further discussion of our equity interest in pbg 
our net investment in pbg was reduced by a write down of aircraft lease receivables of approximately million and additional provisions for credit losses of approximately million related to aircraft lease investments in the us see capital services charges 
off balance sheet items finance receivables sales as part of our capital services programs  we have  from time to time sold  through securitizations  net finance receivables with limited recourse 
in these transactions  we have surrendered control over the transferred assets in accordance with paragraph of fas no 
and received a cash payment from the transferee 
specifically  the finance receivables were sold to a bankruptcy remote limited liability company 
at the time of sale  we obtained legal counsel s opinion that the assets were isolated and that the sale qualified as a true sale at law 
under the terms of the sale  the transferee has the right to pledge or exchange the assets it received 
there are no conditions that both constrain the transferee from taking advantage of its right to pledge or exchange and provide more than a trivial benefit to the transferor 
we do not maintain effective control over the transferred assets 
we have accounted for these transactions as a sale recognizing assets obtained and liabilities incurred in consideration as proceeds of the sale 
any resulting gain or loss was recognized in income at the time of sale 
the maximum risk of loss in these transactions arises from the possible non performance of lessees to meet the terms of their contracts 
we believe adequate provisions for losses have been established for receivables sold which may become uncollectible and for which we have recourse obligation  in accordance with paragraph of fas no 
in selective cases  when we have sold net finance receivables  we entered into guarantee contracts with varying amounts of recourse in privately placed transactions with unrelated third party investors 
the uncollected principal balance of receivables sold and guarantee contracts totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  we do not record these amounts as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
our maximum risk of loss on these net finance receivables and guarantee contracts arises from the possible non performance of lessees to meet the terms of their contracts and from changes in the value of the underlying equipment 
these contracts are secured by the underlying equipment value  and supported by the creditworthiness of our customers 
at december   the underlying equipment value exceeded the sum of the uncollected principal balance of receivables sold and the guarantee contracts 
as part of our review of our risk exposure  we believe we have made adequate provision for sold receivables and guarantee contracts which may not be collectible 
see notes  and to the consolidated financial statements 
we do not depend on these types of transactions to fund our leasing investments 
we selectively use these transactions when the overall economic impact on us is more favorable than debt 
equity interest during  we formed pbg with gatx corporation gatx for the purpose of financing and managing certain leasing related assets existing at that time 
we contributed assets to pbg and maintain a interest 
we account for our investment in pbg under the equity method 
our maximum exposure is our investment of million on our consolidated balance sheet at december  pbg s total assets and liabilities at december  are million and million  respectively 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  we do not record these assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 

table of contents state and local government financing we have originated tax exempt secured loans to state and local governments and have sold certificates of interest in these loans 
generally  we recognize revenue for the fees we receive upon the sale of these certificates 
these transactions however  may require us to buy back certificates if interest rates rise significantly 
our maximum risk of loss arises because we may be required to buy back certificates and resell them to other third parties at below our cost 
we have structured these transactions so that even in a rising interest rate environment  our losses would be minimal 
we have further minimized any risk of non performance on the state and local government loans by obtaining credit guarantees of these loans from a highly rated nationally recognized insurance company 
certificates outstanding at december  and were million and million  respectively  which represent our maximum exposure to state and local government financing 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  we do not record these certificates as assets or liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
our potential requirement to buy back certificates is based on movements of the bond market association bma municipal index 
our weighted average coupon rate on the underlying secured loans is approximately 
the current market rate per the bma index is on january  we pay a premium over the bma index in the range of to basis points 
we would be required to buy back certificates if rates rise by approximately basis points 
we have periodically entered into a fixed rate contract with investors whereby we lock in a fixed rate for a fixed period  generally months 
this insulates our interest rate risk for that set period of time 
we recognized net pre tax gains losses after expenses of million  million and 
million in  and  respectively 
restructuring charges in january  we announced that we will undertake restructuring initiatives related to realigned infrastructure requirements and reduced manufacturing needs for digital equipment 
we expect that the pre tax cost of these restructuring initiatives will be about million over a two year period as the various initiatives take effect 
in  we adopted a formal restructuring plan to implement a common  streamlined business infrastructure across the corporation as a result of our decisions to spin off our office systems business and align our mailing business on a global basis  as well as cost saving opportunities resulting from strategic acquisitions and partnerships  and additional benefits attained from the consolidation of our it organization and erp initiatives 
in connection with this plan  we recorded pre tax restructuring charges of million in  of which million was related to continuing operations and the remaining million was related to discontinued operations 
the restructuring charges related to continuing operations have been segregated in the consolidated statements of income for the year ended december  the restructuring charges related to discontinued operations have been reported in discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended december  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the restructuring charges related to continuing operations are composed of dollars in millions year ended december  severance and benefit costs asset impairments other exit costs all restructuring charges  except for the asset impairments  will result in cash outflows 
the severance and benefit costs relate to a reduction in workforce of approximately  employees worldwide which was initiated in and was substantially completed at december  the workforce reductions relate to actions across several of our businesses resulting from infrastructure and process improvements and our continuing efforts to streamline operations  and include managerial  professional  clerical and technical roles 
approximately of our workforce reductions are in the us the majority of the international workforce reductions are in europe 
none of the reductions will impact our sales coverage 
at december    employees were separated under these initiatives and approximately million of severance and benefit costs were paid 
asset impairments relate primarily to the disposal or abandonment of certain hardware and software applications  resulting from the alignment of our mailing business on a global basis and erp initiatives 
other exit costs relate primarily to lease termination costs  non cancelable lease payments  and other costs associated with business activities that have been exited and the consolidation of excess facilities 

table of contents the restructuring charges related to discontinued operations are composed of dollars in millions year ended december  severance and benefit costs asset impairments other exit costs the severance and benefit costs relate to a reduction in workforce of approximately employees 
the asset impairments relate primarily to an impairment of residual values  in connection with leases of copier equipment  and the write down of certain facsimile and copier equipment  resulting from the spin off of our office systems business 
other exit costs relate primarily to incremental costs associated with cancellation and separation of facility occupancy leases that are shared between the company and igi 
accrued restructuring charges at december  consist of the following dollars in millions total restructuring charges cash payments non cash charges ending balance at december  cash payments ending balance at december  severance and benefit costs asset impairments other exit costs this restructuring plan was substantially completed at december  the restructuring charges are expected to continue to increase our operating efficiency and effectiveness in and beyond while enhancing growth  primarily as a result of reduced personnel related expenses 
we achieved pre tax savings in operating expenses of approximately million in from these restructuring initiatives 
in  we recorded a pre tax charge of approximately million related to the consolidation of information technology staff and infrastructure 
this initiative was focused on creating an efficient global organization and technology platform to leverage the benefits of our erp and e business initiatives 
the majority of the initiatives and cash outflows relating to this consolidation were completed by december  meter transition in  we adopted a formal plan to transition to the next generation of networked mailing technology 
the information capture and exchange  made possible by advanced technology  turns the postage meter into an intelligent terminal that networks the mailer to postal and carrier information and systems 
this two way information architecture  in turn  enables convenient access to and delivery of value added services such as tracking  delivery confirmation and rate information 
the adoption of this plan was facilitated by our expanded access to technology and our ability to move to networked products combined with our expectations that the us and postal services around the world will continue to encourage the migration of mailing systems to networked digital technologies 
as a result of this plan  certain electronic meter rental assets and related equipment will not be placed back in service 
in addition  certain leased equipment will either not be remarketed or will result in lower realization at end of lease as a result of the introduction of new technology 
in connection with this plan  we recorded non cash pre tax charges of million for the year ended december   related to assets associated with our non networked mailing technology 
in november  postal regulations were issued  consistent with our meter transition plan  defining the meter migration process and timing

liquidity and capital resources our ratio of current assets to current liabilities declined to 
to at december  compared with 
to at december  the decrease in this ratio was primarily due to the substitution of long term debt for short term 
to manage interest rate risk  we use a balanced mix of debt maturities  variable and fixed rate debt and interest rate swap agreements 
in  we received million in cash associated with the termination of four swap agreements 
as a result of these transactions  our fixed to floating percentages increased to and  respectively at december  compared to and  respectively at december  our cash and cash equivalents increased to million at december  from million at december  the increase resulted primarily from million provided by operating activities  offset in part by million and million used in investing and financing activities  respectively 
net cash of million provided by operating activities consisted primarily of net income adjusted for non cash items  and the increase in deferred taxes on income  partially offset by our pension plan investment of million  changes in working capital and our investment in internal finance receivables 
net cash used in working capital resulted primarily from increases in inventory to support new product introductions 
net cash of million used in investing activities consisted primarily of acquisitions  investments in fixed assets and leveraged leases  partially offset by capital services asset sales and reserve account deposits 
net cash of million used in financing activities consisted primarily of stock repurchases  dividends paid to stockholders and payments on long term obligations partially offset by net proceeds from long term obligations 
in  we made year end contributions of approximately million and million to our us and us pension plans  respectively 
we expect these additional investments to significantly offset the impact of changes to actuarial assumptions and loss experience 
based on historical results and future projections  we concluded that a reduction to the long term return on asset assumption to in was warranted 
additionally  we have lowered the discount rate to and adopted a new mortality table 
we expect that incremental pension costs attributable to these assumption changes  net of the impact of the pension plan contributions  will be approximately cents per diluted share 
excluding special items and discontinued operations in both periods  the ratio of ebit to interest was x and x and the ratio of ebitda to interest was x and x for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the ratio of total debt to total debt and stockholders equity was at december   versus at december  including the preferred stockholders equity in a subsidiary company as debt  the ratio of total debt to total debt and stockholders equity was at december  compared to at december  the increase in this ratio was driven primarily by debt related to acquisitions and the million repurchase of million shares of common stock 
we generated million of free cash flow defined as cash from operations less capital expenditures which partially offset the increase in this ratio 
excluding the cash flow impacts of the pension plan investment and payments related primarily to restructuring initiatives  free cash flow was million in see reconciliation below 
in  we sold our pitneyworks sm business rewards sm visa and business visa card operations  including credit card receivables of approximately million  to us bank  a division of us bancorp 
the proceeds from the sale were used for general corporate purposes  including the repayment of commercial paper  financing acquisitions and the repurchase of company stock 
the sale included standard representations and warranties with regard to the underlying assets and also included an indemnification provision whereby we would potentially reimburse us bank if credit losses in the portfolio exceeded agreed upon levels 
in  we terminated a related co branded credit card program arrangement with us bank that the parties entered into at the time of the sale of the portfolio 
as part of that termination  we were relieved of any on going liability for indemnification for credit losses 
as a result  we have no ongoing liability to us bancorp related to credit losses in the portfolio or any contingent liability related to the sale  and hence  there is no future impact on our liquidity or capital resources 
in november  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common stock over the next to months

as part of this transaction  we agreed to repurchase the stock in years 
additionally  we entered into a cross currency interest rate swap with the same institutional investor  effectively converting the obligation to a million note that bears interest at a floating rate of approximately libor minus basis points 
this note will be recorded as long term debt in our consolidated balance sheet 
the proceeds from this transaction will be used for general corporate purposes which may include repaying commercial paper  financing acquisitions and the repurchase of company stock

the following summarizes our contractual obligations at december   and the effect that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods dollars in millions total less than year years after years commercial paper borrowings long term debt and current portion of long term debt non cancelable capital lease obligations non cancelable operating lease obligations capital investment during  net investments in fixed assets included net additions of million to property  plant and equipment and million of rental equipment and related inventories  compared with million and million  respectively  in these additions included expenditures for normal plant and manufacturing equipment 
in the case of rental equipment  the additions included the production of postage meters and the purchase of facsimile and copier equipment related to the discontinued operations of igi in excluding igi  during  net additions to property  plant and equipment were million and rental equipment was million 
we expect net investments in fixed assets in  relating to continuing operations  to be slightly higher than the prior year 
these investments will also be affected by the timing of our customers transition to digital meters 
at december   commitments for the acquisition of property  plant and equipment reflected plant and manufacturing equipment improvements as well as rental equipment for new and replacement programs 
legal and regulatory matters legal in the ordinary course of normal business  we are routinely defendants in or parties to a number of pending and threatened legal actions including proceedings purportedly brought on behalf of classes of claimants 
these may involve litigation by or against us relating to  among other things contractual rights under vendor  insurance or other contracts intellectual property or patent rights equipment  service  payment or other disputes with customers disputes with employees in those cases where we are the defendants  plaintiffs may seek to recover large and sometimes unspecified amounts of damages or other types of relief and some matters may remain unresolved for several years 
although we cannot predict the outcome of such matters  based on current knowledge  management does not believe that the ultimate outcome of the litigations referred to in this section will have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
however  if the plaintiffs do prevail  the result may have a material effect on our financial position  future results of operations or cash flows

usps information based indicia program ibip in may  the usps publicly announced its concept of its ibip for future postage evidencing devices 
as initially stated by the usps  the purpose of the program was to develop a new standard for future digital postage evidencing devices which would significantly enhance postal revenue security and support expanded usps value added services to mailers 
the program would consist of the development of four separate specifications i the indicium specification  ii a postal security device specification  iii a host specification  and iv a vendor infrastructure specification 
during the period from may through december   we submitted extensive comments to a series of proposed ibip specifications issued by the usps  including comments on the ibi performance criteria 
other regulatory matters in june  we received an examination report from the internal revenue service irs showing proposed income tax adjustments for the to tax years 
the total additional tax proposed by the irs for the through tax years is about million 
in august  we filed a protest with the irs to challenge most of the proposed deficiencies asserted by the irs 
we believe that we have meritorious defenses to those deficiencies and that the ultimate outcome will not result in a material effect on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
however  if the irs prevails on its asserted deficiencies  additional tax may be due for and future tax years  which could materially affect our future results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
at any time  our provision for taxes could be affected by changes in tax law and interpretations by governments or courts

we believe we have complied fully with the antitrust laws and cooperated fully with the department s investigation 
in february  the justice department advised us that it has decided to close this investigation with no further action 
effects of inflation and foreign exchange inflation  although moderate in recent years  continues to affect worldwide economies and the way companies operate 
it increases labor costs and operating expenses  and raises costs associated with replacement of fixed assets such as rental equipment 
despite these growing costs and the usps meter migration initiatives  we have generally been able to maintain profit margins through productivity and efficiency improvements  continual review of both manufacturing capacity and operating expense levels  and  to an extent  price increases 
although not affecting income  translation gains of million were recorded in resulting from the stronger british pound and euro as compared to the us dollar 
deferred translation losses of million and million were realized in and  respectively 
these translation losses resulted principally from weaker canadian dollar  british pound and euro currencies as compared to the us dollar during those years 

table of contents the results of our international operations are subject to currency fluctuations 
we enter into foreign exchange contracts primarily to minimize our risk of loss from such fluctuations 
exchange rates can impact settlement of our intercompany receivables and payables that result from transfers of finished goods inventories between our affiliates in different countries  and intercompany loans 
at december   we had approximately million of foreign exchange contracts outstanding  most of which mature in  to buy or sell various currencies 
risks arise from the possible non performance by counterparties in meeting the terms of their contracts and from movements in securities values  interest and or exchange rates 
however  we do not anticipate non performance by the counterparties as they are composed of a number of major international financial institutions 
maximum risk of loss on these contracts is limited to the amount of the difference between the spot rate at the date of the contract delivery and the contracted rate 
dividend policy our board of directors has a policy to pay a cash dividend on common stock each quarter 
in setting dividend payments  our board considers the dividend rate in relation to the company s recent and projected earnings and our capital investment opportunities and requirements 
we have paid a dividend each year since forward looking statements we want to caution readers that any forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of in this form k  other reports or press releases or made by our management involve risks and uncertainties which may change based on various important factors 
these forward looking statements are those which talk about the company s or management s current expectations as to the future and include  but are not limited to  statements about the amounts  timing and results of possible restructuring charges and future earnings 
words such as estimate  project  plan  believe  expect  anticipate  intend  and similar expressions may identify such forward looking statements 
some of the factors which could cause future financial performance to differ materially from the expectations as expressed in any forward looking statement made by or on our behalf include changes in international or national political conditions  including any terrorist attacks negative developments in economic conditions  including adverse impacts on customer demand changes in postal regulations timely development and acceptance of new products success in gaining product approval in new markets where regulatory approval is required successful entry into new markets mailers utilization of alternative means of communication or competitors products the company s success at managing customer credit risk  including risks associated with commercial passenger and cargo aircraft leasing transactions changes in interest rates foreign currency fluctuations timing and execution of the restructuring plan timing and execution of the meter transition plan regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other conditions to consummation of any acquisitions and integration of recent acquisitions impact on mail volume resulting from current concerns over the use of the mail for transmitting harmful biological agents third party suppliers ability to provide product components negative income tax adjustments for prior audit years and changes in tax laws or regulations terms and timing of actions to reduce exposures and disposal of assets in capital services segment continuing developments in the us and foreign airline industry changes in pension and retiree medical costs 

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations due to our investing and funding activities and our operations in different foreign currencies 
our objectives in managing our exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve our objectives  we use a balanced mix of debt maturities and variable and fixed rate debt together with interest rate swaps 
our objective in managing our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce the volatility in earnings and cash flows associated with the effect of foreign exchange rate changes on transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies 
accordingly  we enter into various contracts  which change in value as foreign exchange rates change  to protect the value of external and intercompany transactions 
the principal currencies hedged are the british pound  canadian dollar and euro 
we employ established policies and procedures governing the use of financial instruments to manage our exposure to such risks 
we do not enter into foreign currency or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of the related exposures 
we utilize a value at risk var model to determine the maximum potential loss in fair value from changes in market conditions 
the var model utilizes a variance co variance approach and assumes normal market conditions  a confidence level and a one day holding period 
the model includes all of our debt and all interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts 
the model excludes anticipated transactions  firm commitments  and receivables and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies  which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge 
the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by us  nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors 
during  our maximum potential one day loss in fair value of our exposure to foreign exchange rates and interest rates  using the variance co variance technique described above  was not material
