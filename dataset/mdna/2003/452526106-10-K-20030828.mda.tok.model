should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected

the company tested goodwill for impairment as of march   as required by sfas no 
 utilizing a combination of valuation techniques  including the expected present value of future cash flows and a market multiple approach  and found no impairment 
interest expense when compared to the prior year  interest expense decreased million in fiscal the decrease is primarily the result of reduced borrowings on long term debt and a more favorable interest rate that became effective in may under the original loan agreement and continued with the july amendment to the loan agreement

selling and marketing expenses decreased million for fiscal as compared to the prior year 
until the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company had been developing an infrastructure to support an increased level of instrument sales
