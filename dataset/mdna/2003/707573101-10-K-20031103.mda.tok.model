the company may need to increase its credit facility for increases in quantities of lpg purchased and or to finance future price increases of lpg 
the company depends heavily on sales to one major customer 
the company s sources of liquidity and capital resources historically have been provided by sales of lpg  proceeds from the issuance of short term and long term debt  revolving credit facilities and credit arrangements  sale or issuance of preferred and common stock of the company and proceeds from the exercise of warrants to purchase shares of the company s common stock 
in additional to the above  the company intends to spin off a major portion of its assets to its stockholders see note r in the consolidated financial statement 
as a result of the spin off  the company s stockholders equity will be reduced by the amount of the spin off which may result in a deficit in stockholders equity and a portion of the company s current cash flow from operations will be shifted to the partnership 
therefore  the company s remaining cash flow may not be sufficient to allow the company to pay its federal income tax liability resulting from the spin off  if any  and other liabilities and obligations when due 
the partnership will be liable as guarantor on the company s collateralized debt discussed in the preceding paragraph and will continue to pledge all of its assets as collateral

on march   the company completed a settlement with cpsc and cowboy  which provided the company with the remaining interest in the us mexico pipelines  matamoros terminal facility and related land  permits or easements the acquired assets previously constructed and or owned by cpsc and leased to the company 
until the settlement was completed see below  the company had recorded the remaining portion of the us mexico pipelines and matamoros terminal facility as a capital lease 
in addition  as part of the settlement  the company conveyed to cpsc all of its rights to a certain property the sold asset 
the foregoing is more fully discussed below 
the terms of the settlement did not deviate in any material respect from the terms previously reported except that the fair value of the warrants issued in connection with the settlement see below was reduced from  to  as a result of a decrease in the market value of the company s common stock

acquisition of mexican subsidiaries 
effective april   the company completed the purchase of of the outstanding common stock of both termatsal and pennmex the mexican subsidiaries  previous affiliates of the company which were principally owned by a former officer and director see note d to the consolidated financial statements 
the company paid a nominal purchase price 
as a result of the acquisition  the company has included the results of the mexican subsidiaries in its consolidated financial statements at july   and since inception  the operations of the mexican subsidiaries had been funded by the company and such amounts funded were included in the company s consolidated financial statements prior to the acquisition date 
therefore there were no material differences between the amounts previously reported by the company and the amounts that would have been reported by the company had the mexican subsidiaries been consolidated since inception 
during july  the company acquired an option to purchase tergas for a nominal price from an officer and consultant of the company see note d to the consolidated financial statements 
mexican operations 
under current mexican law  foreign ownership of mexican entities involved in the distribution of lpg or the operation of lpg terminal facilities is prohibited 
foreign ownership is permitted in the transportation and storage of lpg 
mexican law also provides that a single entity is not permitted to participate in more than one of the defined lpg activities transportation  storage or distribution 
pennmex has a transportation permit and the mexican subsidiaries own  lease  or are in the process of obtaining the land or rights of way used in the construction of the mexican portion of the us mexico pipelines  and own the mexican portion of the assets comprising the us mexico pipelines  the matamoros terminal facility and the saltillo terminal 
the company s mexican affiliate  tergas  sa de sa tergas  has been granted the permit to operate the matamoros terminal facility and the company relies on tergas permit to continue its delivery of lpg at the matamoros terminal facility 
tergas is owned by an officer of the company and the remaining balance is owned by a consultant of the company see above 
the company pays tergas its actual cost for distribution services at the matamoros terminal facility plus a small profit 
the company had previously completed construction of an additional lpg terminal facility in saltillo  mexico the saltillo terminal 
the company was unable to receive all the necessary approvals to operate the facility at that location 
the company has identified an alternate site in hipolito  mexico  a town located in the proximity of saltillo to relocate the saltillo terminal 
the relocation of the saltillo terminal is very important to the company s growth strategy in mexico 
the expense of such relocation is estimated to be  once completed  the company expects the newly constructed terminal facility to be capable of off loading lpg from railcars to trucks 
the newly constructed terminal facility will have three truck loading racks and storage to accommodate approximately  gallons of lpg 
once operational  the company can directly transport lpg via railcar from the brownsville terminal facility to the saltillo area 
the company believes that by having the capability to deliver lpg to the saltillo area  the company will be able to further penetrate the mexican market for the sale of lpg 
through its operations in mexico and the operations of the mexican subsidiaries and tergas  the company is subject to the tax laws of mexico which  among other things  require that the company comply with transfer pricing rules  the payment of income  asset and ad valorem taxes  and possibly taxes on distributions in excess of earnings 
in addition  distributions to foreign corporations  including dividends and interest payments may be subject to mexican withholding taxes 
deregulation of the lpg industry in mexico 
the mexican petroleum industry is governed by the ley reglarmentaria del art culo constitutional en el ramo del petr leo the regulatory law to article of the constitution of mexico concerning petroleum affairs the regulatory law  and ley org nica del petr leos mexicanos y organismos subsidiarios the organic law of petr leos mexicanos and subsidiary entities the organic law 
under mexican law and related regulations  pemex is entrusted with the central planning and the strategic management of mexico s petroleum industry  including importation  sales and transportation of lpg 
in carrying out this role  pemex controls pricing and distribution of various petrochemical products  including lpg 
beginning in  as part of a national privatization program  the regulatory law was amended to permit private entities to transport  store and distribute natural gas with the approval of the ministry of energy 
as part of this national privatization program  the mexican government is expected to deregulate the lpg market deregulation 
in june  the regulatory law for lpg was changed to permit foreign entities to participate without limitation in the defined lpg activities related to transportation and storage 
however  foreign entities are prohibited from participating in the distribution of lpg in mexico 
upon deregulation  mexican entities will be able to import lpg into mexico 
under mexican law  a single entity is not permitted to participate in more than one of the defined lpg activities transportation  storage and distribution 
the company or its affiliates expect to sell lpg directly to independent mexican distributors as well as pmi upon deregulation 
the company anticipates that the independent mexican distributors will be required to obtain authorization from the mexican government for the importation of lpg upon deregulation prior to entering into contracts with the company 
during july  the mexican government announced that it would begin to accept applications from mexican companies for permits to allow for the importation of lpg pursuant to provisions already provided for under existing mexican law 
in connection with the above  in august  tergas received a one year permit from the mexican government to import lpg 
during september  the mexican government asked tergas to defer use of the permit and as a result  the company did not sell lpg to distributors other than pmi 
in march  the mexican government again announced its intention to issue permits for free importation of lpg into mexico by distributors and others beginning august  which was again delayed until february tergas permit to import lpg expired during august tergas intends to obtain a new permit when the mexican government begins to accept applications once more 
as a result of the foregoing  it is uncertain as to when  if ever  deregulation will actually occur and the effect  if any  it will have on the company 
however  should deregulation occur  it is the company s intention to sell lpg directly to distributors in mexico as well as pmi 
tergas previously received authorization from mexican customs authorities regarding the use of the us mexico pipelines for the importation of lpg 
the point of sale for lpg which flows through the us mexico pipelines for delivery to the matamoros terminal facility is the united states mexico border 
for lpg delivered into mexico  pmi is the importer of record

in addition to the above  the company intends to spin off a major portion of its assets to its stockholders see note r to the consolidated financial statements 
as a result of the spin off  the company s stockholders equity will be reduced by the amount of the spin off which may result in a deficit in stockholders equity and a portion of the company s current cash flow from operations will be shifted to the partnership 
therefore  the company s remaining cash flow may not be sufficient to allow the company to pay its federal income tax liability resulting from the spin off  if any  and other liabilities and obligations when due 
the partnership will be liable as guarantor on the company s collateralized debt discussed in the preceding paragraph and will continue to pledge all of its assets as collateral 
in addition  the partnership has agreed to indemnify the company for a period of three years from the fiscal year end that includes the date of the spin off for any federal income tax liabilities resulting from the spin off in excess of million 
in view of the matters described in the preceding paragraphs  recoverability of the recorded asset amounts shown in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet is dependent upon the ability of the company to restructure certain of the obligations discussed in the first paragraph and or generate sufficient cash flow through operations or additional debt or equity financing to pay its liabilities and obligations when due  or the ability of the partnership to meet its obligations related to its guarantees and tax agreement in the event the spin off occurs if the company does not accomplish the restructuring or generate sufficient cash flow

the partnership is a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
the partnership has invested in two subsidiaries  rio vista operating partnership lp 
owned by the partnership and owned by the company and rio vista operating gp llc wholly owned by the partnership 
the above subsidiaries are newly formed and are currently inactive 
the company formed the partnership for the purpose of transferring a interest in rio vista operating partnership lp  which will own substantially all of the company s owned pipeline and terminal assets in brownsville and matamoros  the asset transfer in exchange for a general partner interest and a limited partnership interest in the partnership 
the company intends to spin off of the limited partner units to its common stockholders the spin off  resulting in the partnership becoming an independent public company 
the remaining general partner interest will be initially owned and controlled by the company and the company will be responsible for the management of the partnership 
the company will account for the spin off at historical cost 
during september  the company s board of directors and the independent committee of its board of directors formally approved the terms of the spin off and the partnership filed a form registration statement with the securities and exchange commission 
the board of directors anticipates that the spin off will occur in late or in  subject to a number of conditions  including the receipt of an independent appraisal of the assets to be transferred by the company to the partnership in connection with the spin off that supports an acceptable level of federal income taxes to the company as a result of the spin off  the absence of any contractual and regulatory restraints or prohibitions preventing the consummation of the spin off  and final action by the board of directors to set the record date and distribution date for the spin off and the effectiveness of the registration statement 
each shareholder of the company will receive one common unit of the limited partnership interest in the partnership for every eight shares of the company s common stock owned as of the record date 
warrants issued to holders of the existing unexercised warrants of the company will be exchanged in connection with the spin off whereby the holder will receive options to acquire unissued units in the partnership and unissued common shares of the company in exchange for the existing warrants 
the number of units and shares subject to exercise and the exercise price will be set to equalize each option s value before and after the spin off 
ninety eight percent of the cash distributions from the partnership will be distributed to the limited unit holders and the remaining will be distributed to the general partner for distributions up to per unit annually approximately million per year 
distributions in excess of that amount will be shared by the limited unit holders and the general partner based on a formula whereby the general partner will receive disproportionately more distributions per unit than the limited unit holders as annual cash distributions exceed certain milestones 
subsequent to the asset transfer  the partnership will sell lpg directly to pmi and will purchase lpg from the company under a long term supply agreement 
the purchase price of the lpg from the company will be determined based on the company s cost to acquire lpg and a formula that takes into consideration operating costs of both the company and the partnership 
in connection with the spin off  the company will grant to mr 
richter and shore capital llc shore  a company owned by mr 
shore  options to each purchase of the ownership interests in the company s general partner interest in the partnership 
it is anticipated that mr 
richter and shore will exercise these options immediately after the spin off occurs 
the exercise price for each option will be the pro rata share 
of the partnership s tax basis capital immediately after the spin off 
the company will retain voting control of the partnership pursuant to a voting agreement 
in addition  shore will also receive an option to acquire of the common stock of the company and of the limited partnership interest in the partnership at a combined equivalent exercise price of per share 
the partnership will be liable as guarantor for the company s collateralized debt see note p to the consolidated financial statements and will continue to pledge all of its assets as collateral 
the partnership may also be prohibited from making any distributions to unit holders if it would cause an event of default  or if an event of default is existing  under the company s revolving credit facilities  or any other covenant which may exist under any other credit arrangement or other regulatory requirement at the time 
the spin off will be a taxable transaction for federal income tax purposes and may also be taxable under applicable state  local and foreign tax laws to both the company and its stockholders 
the company intends to treat the spin off as a partial liquidation for federal income tax purposes 
a partial liquidation is defined under section e of the code as a distribution that i is not essentially equivalent to a dividend  as determined at the corporate level  which generally requires a genuine contraction of the business of the corporation  ii constitutes a redemption of stock and iii is made pursuant to a plan of partial liquidation and within the taxable year in which the plan is adopted or within the succeeding taxable year 
the company may have a federal income tax liability in connection with the spin off 
if the income tax liability resulting from the spin off is greater than million  the partnership has agreed to indemnify the company for any tax liability resulting from the transaction which is in excess of that amount 
the company believes that the spin off  which effectively separates the partnership  as a limited partnership  from the company will provide greater growth opportunities for each company and the following overall benefits to the company s shareholders tax efficiency 
as a limited partnership  the partnership will be able to operate in a more tax efficient manner by eliminating corporate federal income taxes on a portion of future taxable income which would have been fully subject to corporate federal income taxes 
raising capital 
as a limited partnership  the company believes that the partnership will have an improved ability to raise capital for expansion 
this expansion will benefit the company directly though anticipated contractual arrangements between the parties and indirectly  through the company s general partner interest 
acquisitions 
due to industry preference and familiarity with the limited partnership structure  the company anticipates that the company will improve its competitiveness in making acquisitions of assets that generate qualifying income  as this term is defined in section of the internal revenue code 
recognition 
as a limited partnership  the company anticipates that both the company and the partnership will receive increased analyst coverage and acceptance in the marketplace 
liquidity the partnership expects that once the period for minimum distributions commences it will distribute to the holders of common units on a quarterly basis at least the minimum quarterly distribution of per common unit  or per year  to the extent that the partnership has sufficient cash from operations after establishment of cash reserves and payment of expenses  including the reimbursement of our general partner fees and the guarantees and tax agreement discussed below 
the company intends to restructure certain of its liabilities and obligations to the extent possible  but there can be no assurance that such restructuring can be accomplished or that it will be adequate to allow the company to pay such liabilities and obligations when due 
a portion of the company s current cash flow from operations will be shifted to the partnership as a result of spin off 
as a result  the company s remaining cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to allow the company to pay its federal income tax liability resulting from the spin off  if any  and other liabilities and obligations when due 
the partnership will be liable as guarantor and will continue to pledge all of its assets as collateral on the company s existing debt obligations 
in addition  the partnership has agreed to indemnify the company for a period of three years from the fiscal year end that includes the date of the spin off for any federal income tax liabilities resulting from the spin off in excess of million 
however as a result of the distributions  the partnership may not have sufficient cash flow to pay any obligations related to its guarantees and tax agreement 
if the company s cash flow from operations is not adequate to satisfy such payment of liabilities and obligations and or tax liabilities when due and the partnership is unable to satisfy its guarantees and or tax agreement  the company may be required to pursue additional debt and or equity financing 
in such event  the company s management does not believe that the company would be able to obtain such financing from traditional commercial lenders 
in addition  there can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available on terms attractive to the company or at all 
if additional financing is available through the sale of the company s equity and or other securities convertible into equity securities through public or private financings  substantial and immediate dilution to existing stockholders may occur 
there is no assurance that the company would be able to raise any additional capital if needed 
if additional financing can not be accomplished and the company is unable to pay its liabilities and obligations when due or to restructure certain of its liabilities and obligations  the company may suffer material adverse consequences to its business  financial condition and results of operations
