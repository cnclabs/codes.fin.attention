item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated net sales for the year ended july  were  an increase of from net sales of  in fiscal net income for the year was  an increase of  compared to the loss reported in fiscal of  basic income per share was and fully diluted income per share was in fiscal  versus a basic and diluted loss per share of in fiscal the fiscal net income was positively impacted by a pre tax gain of  on the sale of mineral rights  a pre tax contractual payment of  from a customer that failed to meet minimum purchase requirements under a supply agreement with the company  a pre tax gain on real estate sales of  improved sales and reduced distribution costs 
the increase in net income was partially offset by a pre tax write off associated with the closure of the christmas valley  oregon production facility in the fourth quarter of  a pre tax asset write off of  and a pre tax goodwill write off of  related to the company s equity investment in kamterter 
the fiscal loss was driven by a  pre tax write off associated with a loss on impaired long lived assets 
partially offsetting this loss was a  pre tax gain on the sales of land and mineral rights 
see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the loss on impaired long lived assets  the gains on the sale of land and mineral rights  the other contractual income and the closure and write off of the christmas valley production plant 
net sales of the consumer products group for fiscal were  an increase of from net sales of  in fiscal this segment s operating income increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the net sales increase was driven by the addition of the jonny cat r product line  which also positively contributed to the segment s profit through increased gross profit dollars 
the sales increase was partially offset by the elimination of unprofitable business with wal mart  which was implemented in the fourth quarter of fiscal in that quarter  wal mart and oil dri agreed on new terms pursuant to which oil dri stopped shipping private label cat litter to wal mart distribution centers where the freight cost a cost borne by oil dri was prohibitive 
this change caused sales to be reduced but profits to be increased in terms of both gross profit margin and absolute dollars 
the expenses related to the addition of the jonny cat product line and subsequent marketing investments caused the segment s operating expenses to increase  but that increase was more than offset by the gross profit increase 
the marketing investments associated with the line are intended to stabilize the base jonny cat business and provide a platform for future growth 
net sales of the specialty products group for fiscal were  an increase of from net sales of  in fiscal this segment s operating income increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the profit increase was driven by improved sales of pelunite r and pelunite plus tm animal feed binding agents and by improved pricing from the bleaching earth products due to changes in the geographical sales mix 
net sales of the crop production and horticultural products group for fiscal were  an increase of from net sales of  in fiscal the net sales increase resulted primarily from increased sales of agsorb r drying agents and agricultural carriers  and increased sales of pro s choice r sports field products 
the agricultural carriers business has seen increased sales due to the spread of rotation resistant corn rootworm beetles 
the sports field products have seen strong growth in the golf course market place 
this segment s operating income increased by from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the increase in operating income was driven by the gross profit change from increased sales 
net sales of the industrial and automotive products group for fiscal were  an increase of from net sales of  in fiscal this segment s operating income decreased from a profit of  in fiscal to a loss of  in fiscal the loss was driven by higher manufacturing processing labor and expenses 
also  the fuel price increase seen in the second half of fiscal negatively impacted the income of this segment 
consolidated gross profit as a percentage of net sales for fiscal increased to from in fiscal a favorable sales mix led by the acquired jonny cat product line in the consumer products group  improved sales of pelunite plus and price increases in the specialty product group  increased sales of agsorb and sports field products in crop production and horticultural products group and the elimination of sales to unprofitable geographic areas all contributed to this increase 
the company s year to date fuel costs are down approximately as compared to fiscal while fuel was down for the year  rate increases in the second half of the year drove the overall expenses to be down only compared to fiscal the christmas valley closure negatively impacted the overall gross profit 
approximately  of the  write off was reflected in cost of goods sold 
this adjustment reduced the gross profit percentage from for the year  down to the final reported level of 
the remaining  of the write off was reported as part of other income and expense 
operating expenses as a percentage of net sales for fiscal decreased to from the reported in fiscal excluding the other contractual income in and the loss on impaired assets in  operating expenses for would have remained flat at for both years 
a good portion of the absolute dollar value increase in operating expenses in was experienced in an effort to support the new jonny cat product line 
the increased sales from this line offset the dollar value increase in expense and therefore led to the consistent expense ratio between the two years  after the contractual income and loss on impaired asset are excluded 
interest expense and interest income for fiscal decreased from fiscal due to the reduction in debt 
the company s effective tax rate was of pre tax income in fiscal versus in fiscal the effective tax rate was consistent between the years 
total assets of the company increased  or during fiscal current assets increased  or from the fiscal year end balances  primarily due to increases in accounts receivable  current deferred income taxes and inventory 
the accounts receivable increase was related to the improved sales in the fourth quarter 
quarterly sales were up  or from the fourth quarter of fiscal offsetting some of the increase were decreases in other receivables and prepaid overburden expense 
other receivables decreased due to a change from taxes receivable to taxes payable driven by the profitability of the company 
the prepaid overburden account was reduced by the extra overburden amortization that was incurred in fiscal see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of this issue 
cash  cash equivalents and investments increased  or  from fiscal despite the fact that the company spent over  in cash to consummate the purchase from a wholly owned subsidiary of clorox 
positive operating cash flows drove the combined cash and investments in treasury securities balances to a higher level than reported for fiscal property  plant and equipment  net of accumulated depreciation increased  or  from the year end balance in fiscal the increase in property  plant and equipment associated with the purchase and other normal capital investments were substantially offset by normal depreciation expense on the company s pre existing fixed asset base and the christmas valley  oregon write off 
see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
total liabilities increased  or  during fiscal current liabilities increased  or during fiscal  as a result of increases in current maturities of notes payable  accounts payable  freight payables  accrued trade promotions  and salaries  wages and commissions payable 
the increased business activity in the fourth quarter helped drive increases in several of the payable balances 
long term debt decreases  due to principal payments 
expectations the company believes that sales for fiscal should show a four to seven percent increase over those reported in fiscal the sales from the jonny cat line of products should help to drive this projected increase in sales 
however  the inability to predict potential rate increases in natural gas and other fuel sources causes the company to be cautiously optimistic about the results for fiscal the company expects to build on the progress seen in fiscal and therefore is projecting earnings in the range of to per fully diluted share for fiscal liquidity and capital resources working capital decreased  during fiscal to  primarily due to a reduction of other receivables and prepaid overburden removal expense and increased current notes payable  accounts payable  accrued trade promotions and salaries  wages and commissions payables 
this decrease was offset partially by increased accounts receivables  inventories and cash  cash equivalents and investments in treasury securities 
cash provided by operating activities was used to fund capital expenditures of  the purchase of  payments on long term debt of  repurchases of treasury stock of  and dividend payments of  total cash and investment balances held by the company s foreign subsidiaries at july  and july  were  and  respectively 
accounts receivable  less allowance for doubtful accounts  increased  or  for fiscal  due to the strong fourth quarter sales discussed previously 
during fiscal the company experienced a slight decrease in bad debts expense  from the  in fiscal to  in fiscal the company maintains policies and practices to monitor the creditworthiness of its customers 
these policies include maintaining and monitoring a list of customers whose creditworthiness has diminished 
the total balance of accounts receivable for accounts on that list represents approximately and of the company s outstanding receivables at july  and respectively 
on november   the company and harris trust and savings bank executed a second amendment to the credit agreement  dated january   between them 
see note  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of this amendment 
the table listed on the following page summarizes the company s contractual obligations and commercial commitments at july  for the timeframes listed contractual obligations payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years long term debt      operating leases     unconditional purchase obligations   total contractual cash obligations      other commercial commitments amount of commitment expiration per period other commercial total amounts commitments committed less than year years years after years standby letters of credit   other commercial commitments   total commercial commitments   the company s liquidity needs have been  and are expected to be  met through internally generated funds and  to the extent needed  borrowings under the company s revolving credit facility with harris trust and savings 
as of july   the company had  available under the credit facility 
the credit agreement  as amended  contains restrictive covenants that  among other things and under various conditions including a limitation on capital expenditures  limit the company s ability to incur additional indebtedness or to acquire or dispose of assets and to pay dividends 
the company believes that cash flow from operations and availability under its revolving credit facility will provide adequate funds for foreseeable working capital needs  capital expenditures at existing facilities and debt service obligations 
the company s ability to fund operations  to make planned capital expenditures  to make scheduled debt payments and to remain in compliance with all of the financial covenants under debt agreements  including  but not limited to  the credit agreement  depends on its future operating performance  which  in turn  is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated net sales for the year ended july   were  an increase of from net sales of  in fiscal the improvement was due to a sales increase reported by all of the business segments 
basic and diluted income per share was a loss of  versus basic and diluted net income per share of in fiscal the loss was driven by a  pre tax write off associated with a loss on impaired long lived assets 
partially offsetting this loss were increased sales  a pre tax gain of  on a land sale and the sale of mineral rights  and positive trends in selling  general administrative expenses  interest income and interest expense 
energy costs were stable during the year 
the company s overall sales mix showed a small negative impact in fiscal the consumer segment s negative mix factors were offset in large part by the other segments 
driving the fiscal income was a non recurring fee of  which was partially offset by  of charges covering developmental costs and several capital asset programs that the company no longer intended to pursue in their original form 
see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the loss on impaired long lived assets  gain on the sale of mineral rights and the non recurring fee 
net sales for the consumer products segment for fiscal were  an increase of from net sales of  in fiscal increased sales of private label cat litter  dog treats and co manufactured cat litter items offset the lower sales of branded clay and paper cat litters 
consumer products operating income increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal this increase was due to better expense control in the selling  administrative and advertising areas  improved sales of the dog treat items  offset partially by reduced product pricing in the co manufacturing area and mix weakness in our branded product area 
net sales of the specialty products group for fiscal were  an increase of from net sales of  in fiscal the major change was seen in an  increase in sales to latin america  with conditionade r and various bleaching clays all experiencing increases 
the balance of the marketing areas remained relatively flat compared to fiscal operating income for the specialty products segment increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the increase was due to sales growth in the latin american market  selling price increases in our animal health business  the cessation of the unprofitable rheological products business and improved profitability in some of the bleaching earth products 
the exchange rate fluctuations seen between the euro and the dollar had a minimal impact on the company s marketing to european customers 
net sales of the crop production and horticultural products segment for fiscal were  an increase of from net sales of  in fiscal this increase is due to increased sales of soilmaster r sports field conditioners and terra green r soil conditioner 
crop production and horticultural products operating income increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the increase was due to increased selling prices and decreased selling expenses 
net sales of the industrial and automotive products segment for fiscal year were  an increase of from net sales of  in fiscal a or approximately  sales increase of lites tm products and general price increases were offset by lower volumes of clay products 
industrial and automotive products operating income increased from a loss of  in fiscal to a gain of  in fiscal the selling price increases accounted for much of this change 
consolidated gross profit as a percentage of net sales for fiscal increased to from in fiscal this increase was due to several factors 
the specialty segment contributed additional gross profit from the growth in the latin american sales  selling price increases in our animal health business  the discontinuation of the unprofitable rheological products business and improved profitability in some of the bleaching earth products 
the industrial and crop production segments helped the gross profit picture with price increases 
finally  the company saw solid growth in the consumer segment s dog treat business 
offsetting some of the positive was the continued decline of the coarse litter branded business in the consumer segment  a reduction of the selling prices in the co manufactured products business and a  increase in our obsolescence reserve primarily for product sold by our consumer products group 
operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to for fiscal from in fiscal excluding the loss on impaired assets in fiscal and non recurring fee in fiscal  operating expenses for fiscal would have been and in fiscal reductions in trade and advertising spending in the consumer segment were key contributors to the adjusted value of for fiscal fiscal interest expense was down  from fiscal long term debt was reduced by approximately  during the year 
at july  and  the company did not have any outstanding borrowing against the revolving line of credit 
fiscal interest income was up  from fiscal the company s effective tax rate was of income before tax in fiscal and in fiscal see note  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for the principal reasons for the decrease 
total assets of the company decreased  or during the year ended july  current assets increased  from fiscal year end balances primarily due to increased cash and cash equivalents and investments in treasury securities  offset by decreased accounts receivable and inventories 
property  plant and equipment  net of accumulated depreciation  decreased  during the year 
a significant part of this reduction was caused by the impairment loss 
however  the fact that depreciation expense continued to exceed capital expenditures also played a key part in the reduction 
total liabilities decreased  or during fiscal a majority of the decrease was reported in non current notes payable 
however  accrued freight expense  accounts payable and accrued trade promotions and advertising also decreased 
increases occurred in current maturities on notes payable and accrued wages and salaries expense 
current liabilities increased  or from july  balances 
significant accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles of the us the company annually reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies to ensure that its financial reporting and disclosures provides accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies stated in note  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements the policies listed below involve a higher degree of judgment and or complexity 
the preparation of the financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
significant estimates included inventory reserves  allowance for doubtful accounts and the amount of prepaid overburden 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
revenue recognition 
under the terms of its sales agreements with customers  the company recognizes revenue when title is transferred upon product shipments 
upon shipment an invoice is generated that sets the fixed and determinable price 
sales returns and allowances  which have historically not been material  are reviewed to determine if any additional reserve is necessary 
sales returns and allowances are not material due to the nature of the company s business 
inventories 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
inventory costs include the cost of raw materials  packaging supplies  labor and other overhead costs 
the company performs a detailed review of its inventory items to determine if an obsolescence reserve adjustment is necessary 
the review not only considers specific items  but also takes into consideration the overall value of the inventory as of the balance sheet date 
the company recorded additional inventory obsolescence reserves of approximately   and  in the years  and respectively 
prepaid overburden removal and mining costs 
as part of its overall operations  the company mines sorbent materials on property that it either owns or leases 
a significant part of the company s overall mining cost is incurred during the process of removing the overburden non usable material from the mine site  thus exposing the sorbent material that is then used in a majority of the company s production processes 
the cost of the overburden removal is recorded in a prepaid expense account and  as the usable sorbent material is mined  the prepaid overburden removal expense is amortized over the estimated available material 
the company had  and  of prepaid expense recorded on its consolidated balance sheet  as of july  and july   respectively 
the company amortized to current expense approximately  of previously recorded prepaid expense in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal during the normal course of the company s overburden removal activities the company performs on going reclamation activities 
as overburden is removed from a pit  it is hauled to a previously mined pit and used to refill the older site 
this process allows the company to continuously reclaim older pits and dispose of overburden simultaneously  therefore minimizing the liability for the reclamation function 
additionally  it is oil dri s policy to capitalize the purchase cost of land and mineral rights  including associated legal fees  survey fees and real estate fees 
the cost of obtaining mineral patents  including legal fees and drilling expenses  are also capitalized 
development costs of determining the nature and amount of mineral reserves and any prepaid royalties that are offsetable against future royalties due upon extraction of the mineral are also capitalized 
all exploration related costs are expensed as incurred

forward looking statements certain statements in this report  including  but not limited to  those under the heading expectations and those statements elsewhere in this report that use forward looking terminology such as expect  would  could  should  estimates  anticipates and believes are forward looking statements within the meaning of that term in the securities exchange act of  as amended 
actual results may differ materially from those reflected in these forward looking statements  due to uncertainties such as continued vigorous competition in the grocery  mass merchandiser and club markets and specialty product markets  the level of success of new products  and the cost of product introductions and promotions in the consumer market 
forward looking statements are also subject to the risk of changes in market conditions in the overall economy  energy prices  the risk of war or international instability and  for the fluids purification and agricultural markets  changes in planting activity  crop quality and overall agricultural demand  including export demand  increasing regulation of the food chain and foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
other factors affecting these forward looking statements may be detailed from time to time in other reports filed by the company with the securities and exchange commission 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to interest rate risk and employs policies and procedures to manage its exposure to changes in the market risk of its cash equivalents and short term investments 
the company had two interest rate swap agreements as of july  the company believes that the market risk arising from holdings of its financial instruments is not material 
the company is exposed to regulatory risk in the fluid purification and agricultural markets  principally as a result of the risk of increasing regulation of the food chain in the united states and europe 
the company actively monitors developments in this area  both directly and through trade organizations of which it is a member 
the company is exposed to commodity price risk with respect to natural gas 
the company has contracted for a portion of its fuel needs for fiscal using forward purchase contracts to manage the volatility related to this exposure 
these contracts will reduce the volatility in fuel prices  and the weighted average cost of these contracts has been estimated to be approximately higher than the contracts for fiscal these contracts were entered into during the normal course of business and no contracts were entered into for speculative purposes 
the table below provides information about the company s natural gas future contracts  which are sensitive to changes in commodity prices  specifically natural gas prices 
for the future contracts the table presents the notional amounts in mmbtu s  the weighted average contract prices  and the total dollar contract amount  which will mature by july  the fair value was determined using the most recent settle price for the henry hub natural gas option contract prices as listed by the new york mercantile exchange on september  commodity price sensitivity natural gas future contracts for the year ending july  expected maturity fair value natural gas future volumes mmbtu s  weighted average price per mmbtu contract amount us  in thousands   factors that could influence the fair value of the natural gas contracts  include  but are not limited to  the creditworthiness of the company s natural gas suppliers  the overall general economy  developments in world events  and the general demand for natural gas by the manufacturing sector  seasonality and the weather patterns throughout the united states and the world 
some of these same events have allowed the company to mitigate the impact of the natural gas contracts by the continued and in some cases expanded use of recycled oil in our manufacturing processes 
accurate estimates of the impact that these contracts may have on the company s fiscal financial results are difficult to make due to the inherent uncertainty of future fluctuations in option contract prices in the natural gas options market
