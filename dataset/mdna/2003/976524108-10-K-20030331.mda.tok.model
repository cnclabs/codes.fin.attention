critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses for each period 
the following represents a summary of the critical accounting policies  defined as those policies that the company believes are a the most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and b that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
allowances for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  the company is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
the process incorporates an assessment of the current tax exposure together with temporary differences resulting from different treatment of transactions for tax and financial statement purposes 
such differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheet 
the recovery of deferred tax assets from future taxable income must be assessed and  to the extent that recovery is not likely  the company establishes a valuation allowance 
increases in valuation allowances result in the recording of additional tax expense 
further  if the ultimate tax liability differs from the periodic tax provision reflected in the consolidated statements of operations  additional tax expense may be recorded 
valuation of long lived assets the company assesses the potential impairment of long lived tangible and intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
changes in the operating strategy can significantly reduce the estimated useful life of such assets
