item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
all statements in this form k  other than statements of historical facts  including  without limitation  statements regarding our business strategy  plans for future operations and industry conditions  are forward looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of these forward looking statements are subject to various risks  uncertainties and assumptions  including those we refer to under the heading cautionary statement concerning forward looking statements in part i of this report 
although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  because of the inherent limitations in the forecasting process  as well as the relatively volatile nature of the industries in which we operate  we can give no assurance that those expectations will prove to have been correct 
accordingly  evaluation of our future prospects must be made with caution when relying on forward looking information 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have based the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operation on our consolidated financial statements  which we have prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
these principles require us to make various estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods we present 
we base our estimates on historical experience  available information and other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  however  our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following discussion summarizes the accounting policies we believe require our management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments and are the most critical to our reporting of results of operations and financial position 
revenue recognition 
our revenues are primarily derived from billings under contracts that provide for specific time  material and equipment charges  which we accrue daily and bill periodically  ranging from weekly to monthly 
we account for significant lump sum contracts  which we enter into mainly in our subsea products and advanced technologies segments  using the percentage of completion method 
under this method  we generally recognize estimated contract revenue based on costs incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated costs 
changes in the expected cost of materials and labor  productivity  scheduling and other factors affect the total estimated costs 
additionally  external factors  including weather or other factors outside of our control  may also affect the progress and estimated cost of a project s completion and  therefore  the timing of income and revenue recognition 
we routinely review estimates related to our contracts and reflect revisions to profitability in earnings immediately 
if a current estimate of total contract cost indicates an ultimate loss on a contract  we recognize the projected loss in full when we determine it 
in prior years  we have recorded adjustments to earnings as a result of revisions to contract estimates 
these include a loss on our first steel tube umbilical project in and losses on fixed price jobs in india in for services we no longer provide in foreign markets 
although we are continually striving to improve our ability to estimate our contract costs and profitability  adjustments to overall contract costs may continue to be significant in future periods 
long lived assets 
we evaluate our property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be appropriate 
we base these evaluations on a comparison of the assets fair values  which are generally based on forecasts of cash flows associated with the assets  or fair market value of the assets  to the carrying amounts of the assets 
any impairment is recorded as the amount  if any  by which the carrying amounts exceed the fair values 
during the years ended december  and and the nine month period ended december   we recorded million  million and million  respectively  in impairment charges related to property and equipment 
our expectations regarding future sales and undiscounted cash flows are highly subjective  cover extended periods of time and depend on a number of factors outside our control  such as changes in general economic conditions  laws and regulations 
accordingly  these expectations could differ significantly from year to year 
we expense the costs of repair and maintenance as we incur them  except for drydocking costs associated with our larger vessels 
we estimate and accrue these drydock costs over a period of time in advance of future drydockings 
we recognize differences between the estimates and actual costs incurred in the income statement 
loss contingencies 
we self insure for workers compensation  maritime employer s liability and comprehensive general liability claims to levels we consider financially prudent and carry insurance for exposures beyond the self insurance levels  which can be by occurrence or in the aggregate 
we determine the level of accruals by reviewing our historical experience and current year claim activity 
we do not record accruals on a present value basis 
we review each claim with insurance adjusters and establish specific reserves for known liabilities 
we establish an additional reserve for incidents incurred but not reported to us for each year using our estimates and based on prior experience 
we believe we have established adequate accruals for uninsured expected liabilities arising from those obligations 
however  it is possible that future earnings could be affected by changes in our estimates relating to these matters 
we are involved in various claims and actions against us  most of which are covered by insurance 
we believe that our ultimate liability  if any  that may result from these claims and actions will not materially affect our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
for a summary of our major accounting policies  please read note to our consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources we consider our liquidity and capital resources adequate to support our operations and internally generated growth initiatives 
at december   we had working capital of million  including cash of million 
additionally  we had million available under our revolving credit facility  which is scheduled to expire in october we expect operating cash flow to meet our ongoing annual cash requirements  including debt service  for the foreseeable future 
net cash provided by operating activities was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  and million for the nine month period ended december  our capital expenditures for the years ended december  and and the nine month period ended december  were million  million and million  respectively 
capital expenditures during included rov additions and replacements  a replacement diving service vessel and additions related to the products and controls division of our subsea products segment 
capital expenditures during included expenditures for additional rovs  completion of the ocean legend and upgrades and life extension of the ocean producer necessary for its new seven year contract  which began in the fourth quarter of capital expenditures during the nine month period ended december  included expenditures for the conversion of a jackup drilling rig to a mobile offshore production unit  the ocean legend  for initial use offshore western australia  rov additions and construction costs to complete our second multiservice vessel 
we had no major commitments for capital expenditures at december  in april  we approved a plan to repurchase up to a maximum of million shares of our common stock  and we completed this plan in  at a total cost of million 
we reissued all of these shares through our incentive plans  as restricted stock  contributions to our k plan or for exercised stock options 
for a description of our incentive plans  please read note to our consolidated financial statements 
in september  we approved a plan to repurchase up to million shares  or million  of our common stock 
pursuant to this plan  we repurchased  shares of common stock during the year ended december   at a total cost of million 
at december   we had long term debt of million and a debt to total capitalization ratio 
we have million of senior notes to be repaid from through we have an million revolving credit facility  under which we had no outstanding borrowings and million available for future borrowings at december  this facility is scheduled to expire in october we expect to put a new revolving credit facility in place before the current facility expires 
in march  we added a million term loan facility  which is to be repaid through april at december   we had million in outstanding borrowings under the term loan facility 
both the revolving credit and term loan facilities have short term interest rates that float with market rates  plus applicable spreads 
we have effectively fixed the interest rate on the term loan at approximately through an interest rate swap 
we have no off balance sheet debt and have not guaranteed any debt not reflected on our consolidated balance sheet 
because of our significant foreign operations  we are exposed to currency fluctuations and exchange risks 
we generally minimize these risks primarily through matching  to the extent possible  revenues and expenses in the various currencies in which we operate 
cumulative translation adjustments as of december  relate primarily to our permanent investments in and loans to our foreign subsidiaries 
inflation has not had a material effect on us in the past two years and no such effect is expected in the near future 
see item business description of business risks and insurance 
restatement we have restated our financial statements as of and for the year ended december  and for the nine month period ended december  to correct errors related to our accounting for  among other things  restricted stock expense  brazilian currency translation and the timing of certain employee benefit accruals 
the following discussion addresses those financial results as restated

offshore oil and gas 
the table below sets out revenue and profitability for our offshore oil and gas business for the years ended december  and and the nine month period ended december  year ended december  nine month period ended december  dollars in thousands remotely operated vehicles revenue gross margin gross margin operating income operating income subsea products revenue gross margin gross margin operating income operating income mobile offshore production systems revenue gross margin gross margin operating income operating income other services revenue gross margin gross margin operating income operating income total offshore oil and gas revenue gross margin gross margin operating income operating income in response to continued increasing demand to support deepwater drilling and identified future construction and production maintenance work  we extended our rov fleet expansion program in by announcing plans for additional new rovs 
these new vehicles are designed for use around the world in water depths to  feet and in severe weather conditions 
we have added over rovs to our fleet during the last several years and we plan to add additional vehicles at a rate dependent on market demand 
in the past few years  we have sold or exchanged our foreign diving related assets  which were part of our other services segment  to concentrate on our other deepwater services and products which have potential for higher margins in april  we sold our north sea diving assets  including a diving support vessel  in march  we sold our west africa diving and related vessel assets  and in september  we exchanged our asia  australia and middle east diving assets  including a diving support vessel  for rovs 
for the year ended december   rov revenue was lower than the prior year 
gross margin declined and gross margin percentage declined 
these declines resulted from a decrease in fleet utilization of  from to  and an increase in repair and maintenance expenses 
in the year ended december   rov gross margin percentage rose over the nine month period ended december  the increase was the result of more rovs available for service and an increase in rov utilization from to 
we anticipate rov utilization and margins to slightly increase in due to programs we have put in place to improve our rov marketing and operations 
subsea products revenue in was lower than in  while gross margin and operating income percentages were up and  respectively 
in  we were producing our first large steel tube umbilical order at a loss 
when we completed the project in the first half of  the resulting available capacity allowed our uk plant to take on profitable work 
in  we completed manufacturing an order in excess of million in our brazilian plant 
this was the largest umbilical contract in our company s history 
both gross margin and operating income percentages for subsea products rose in over the nine month period ended december  from improved pricing 
we anticipate lower results from our subsea products segment in  particularly in the first half of the year  as our backlog at december  was lower than it was at december  mobile offshore production systems revenue was up for as compared to  primarily from a full year of service from the ocean legend  as compared to eight months in gross margin percentage and operating income percentage were both up 
in we received and recognized million as revenue relating to a dispute with our customer 
in addition  the ocean producer began operation under a new seven year contract in the fourth quarter of  at higher revenues and margins than its prior contract 
gross margin percentage for mobile offshore production systems was lower in than for the nine month period ended december  primarily because the period had million of gains on the sales of two out of service semisubmersible rigs  partially offset by a million writedown of a tanker we had been holding for conversion into production service 
we anticipate slightly lower results from our mobile offshore production systems operations in as a result of a lower dayrate for the ocean legend  which took effect when its contract was extended in may the contract now is scheduled to expire in may other services revenue increased for as compared to  while gross margin and operating margin increased and  respectively 
a significant improvement in offshore activity in the gulf of mexico was the impetus for these improvements 
we experienced an increase in utilization and profitability from our two gulf of mexico ocean intervention multiservice vessels in  along with a contribution from a significant engineering and specialized diving contract 
gross margin and operating income percentages were higher for as compared to the nine month period ended december  primarily because the period included losses from two large fixed price jobs in india incurred before we sold those operations in september we anticipate lower results from our other services on lower ocean intervention vessel utilization and lower contribution from our gulf of mexico diving operations 
in january  we purchased ois international inspection plc for million in cash 
ois is a global provider of non destructive testing and inspection services  principally to the oil and gas industry 
we do not expect the acquisition to materially affect our results in advanced technologies 
the table below sets out revenue and profitability for this segment for the years ended december  and and the nine month period ended december  year ended december  nine month period ended december  dollars in thousands revenue gross margin gross margin operating income operating income advanced technologies revenue  gross margin and gross margin percentage for was about the same as during an increase in marine services offset a decline in subsea telecommunication cable rov services and lower space related product sales 
operating income declined by million  or  due to a million charge to selling  general and administrative expenses for a doubtful account receivable related to work performed in prior years for an aerospace industry customer 
our gross margin and operating margin percentages were higher in over the nine month period ended december  primarily because the period included provisions totaling million relating to operations of a division we no longer own 
we anticipate revenues  gross margin and gross margin percentage to be similar to results 
however  we expect our business mix of projects to change with higher activity related to vessel maintenance  pier and mooring repairs  submarine services for the us navy  and design and construction of specialized equipment for theme parks 
we expect our operating income to increase in  primarily as a result of the negative impact in of the charge for the doubtful receivable described above 
unallocated expenses 
our unallocated expenses  ie  those not associated with a specific business segment  within gross margin consist of expenses related to our incentive and deferred compensation plans  including restricted stock and bonuses  as well as other general expenses 
our restricted stock expense varies with the market price of our common stock 
our unallocated expenses within operating income consist of those within gross margin plus general and administrative expenses related to corporate functions 
the table below sets out our unallocated expenses for the years ended december  and and the nine month period ended december year ended december  nine month period ended december  dollars in thousands gross margin expenses of revenue operating expenses of revenue other 
general and administrative expenses were at a relatively flat rate over the periods presented  except that contained a million charge for the doubtful account receivable mentioned in the advanced technologies segment discussion above 
interest expense increased through as a result of our increased borrowings to fund capital expenditures and repurchases of common stock 
interest expense declined in  as we generated sufficient cash flow to reduce our debt by million and increase our cash by million 
interest expense is net of capitalized interest of million for the year ended december  and million for the nine month period ended december  equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates primarily relates to our share of our commercial cable laying and maintenance venture 
due to the current condition of the telecommunications market  this venture is currently inactive and the single vessel used in the venture is being marketed for oilfield and other uses 
other income expense  net primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses 
our effective tax rate  determined after consideration of valuation allowances and foreign  state and local taxes  was  and for the years ended december  and and the nine month period ended december   respectively 
we lowered our effective tax rate to in as we anticipate that we will be able to realize foreign tax credits and we were able to finalize tax positions related to the foreign vessel and diving operations that we sold in for  we anticipate an effective tax rate of approximately

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are currently exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions we have entered into in the normal course of business 
these risks relate to interest rate changes and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
we do not believe these risks are material 
we have not entered into any market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
we manage our exposure to interest rate changes through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt and an interest rate hedge 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report for a description of our long term debt agreements  interest rates and maturities 
we believe that significant interest rate changes will not have a material near term impact on our future earnings or cash flows 
because we operate in various oil and gas exploration and production regions in the world  we conduct a portion of our business in currencies other than the us dollar 
the functional currency for many of our international operations is the applicable local currency 
we manage our exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates primarily through arranging compensation in us dollars or freely convertible currency and  to the extent possible  by limiting compensation received in other currencies to amounts necessary to meet obligations denominated in those currencies 
we use the exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date to translate assets and liabilities as to which the functional currency is the local currency  resulting in translation adjustments that we reflect as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in the shareholders equity section of our consolidated balance sheets 
we recorded an million adjustment to our equity accounts for the year ended december  to reflect the net impact of the strengthening of various foreign currencies against the us dollar for locations where the functional currency is not the us dollar 
our subsea products business in brazil conducts much of its operations in us dollars  which is its functional currency 
we recorded million of foreign currency losses in our statement of operations in related to our operations in brazil
