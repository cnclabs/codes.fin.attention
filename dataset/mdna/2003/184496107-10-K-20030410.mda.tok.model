table of contents expand network of service centers 
the company believes that its site services division has a competitive advantage when service centers are located near a tsdf 
the company now has tsdfs and service centers 
by opening additional service centers close to the tsdfs it now operates  the company believes that it can  with minimal expenditure of funds  increase its market share of site services 
much of the additional waste that is generated can be sent to existing facilities at competitive transportation costs to increase the utilization of the plants and thereby increase their profitability 
penetrate the industrial maintenance services market 
in  the company added to its service offerings industrial cleaning and maintenance 
the company believes that industrial maintenance services offer significant opportunities for growth for the company because of the multi billion dollar size of the market and the company s small current penetration of this market 
the expansion in industrial maintenance services leverages the company s hazardous waste disposal assets because hazardous wastes are often removed in the cleaning process 
improve utilization of existing waste facilities 
the company has a network of active hazardous waste management properties 
services offered at these properties include five incineration facilities  nine commercial landfills  wastewater treatment operations  transportation  storage and disposal facilities  and six locations specializing in pcb management 
some properties offer multiple capabilities 
these facilities represent a substantial investment in permits  plants and equipment 
this network of facilities provides the company with significant operating leverage 
there are opportunities to expand waste handling capacity at these facilities by modifying the terms of the existing permits and by adding capital equipment and new technology 
through selected permit modifications  the company can expand the range of treatment services it offers to its customers without the large capital investment necessary to acquire or build new waste management facilities 
develop new waste management services 
industrial waste generators are demanding alternatives to traditional waste disposal methods in order to increase recycling and reclamation and to minimize the end disposal of hazardous waste 
the company utilizes its technological expertise and innovation to improve and expand the range of services which it offers to its customers  and to develop less expensive methods of disposing of hazardous waste 
capitalize on industry consolidation 
the company believes that its large industrial customers increasingly require a comprehensive range of environmental services including site and facility decontamination  industrial maintenance services  emergency response services  technical services  waste consulting and information management services to be provided by a select number of service providers 
this trend should place smaller operators at a competitive disadvantage due to their size and limited financial resources 
to respond to its customers needs  the company has increased the range of environmental services it offers 
the company continues to evaluate other business opportunities in order to enhance service to its existing customer base and expand its customer base 
in addition  the company seeks acquisitions within its existing areas of operation in order to obtain incremental market share 
provide e commerce solutions 
the company enhanced its internet functionality to provide order fulfillment  waste profiling and transportation scheduling 
the company believes its e commerce capabilities are superior to those of its competitors in the environmental services industry and that increasing the percentage of transactions that utilize e commerce will result in lower costs of services 
industry the hazardous waste industry was created in with the passage of the resource conservation and recovery act rcra 
these congressional regulations became effective in  requiring waste generators to distinguish between hazardous and non hazardous wastes  and to treat  store and dispose of hazardous waste in accordance with specific regulations 
this new regulatory environment  combined with strong economic growth  increased corporate concern surrounding environmental liabilities  and early stage industry dynamics 
table of contents contributed to a rapid growth in the hazardous waste industry 
initial entrants into the hazardous waste industry realized high profit margins  which attracted a wave of new competition  expanded the industry s capacity and created an excess supply of services 
this overcapacity coincided with the waste minimization efforts of large waste generators  leading to a subsequent decline in prices  operating margins and profits 
the company expects pricing in the industry to stabilize or improve as the industry continues to consolidate  but the company can not predict when pricing will stabilize or improve 
the largest generators of hazardous waste materials are companies in the chemical and petrochemical  primary metals  paper  furniture  aerospace and pharmaceutical industries 
automotive manufacturers and suppliers  electrical  oil and gas companies are also significant generators of hazardous waste 
many large companies and institutions that produce large amounts of hazardous waste treat or reclaim a large percentage of their own wastes internally as part of the manufacturing process or recycling efforts 
the collection and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes are subject to local  state  provincial and federal requirements  which regulate health  safety  the environment  zoning and land use 
in the united states  the epa as well as various other federal  state and local environmental  health and safety agencies and authorities administer these regulations 
included in these regulations are the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of  as amended by the superfund amendments and reauthorization act cercla 
as part of cercla  generators and transporters of hazardous substances  as well as past and present owners and operators of sites where there has been a release of hazardous substances  are made strictly  jointly and severally liable for the clean up costs resulting from releases and threatened releases of cercla regulated hazardous substances 
canadian companies are regulated under the canadian environmental protection act and specific provincial environmental regulations 
in general  these regulations establish requirements controlling releases to air  land and water  provide for worker protection and control the transportation of hazardous waste and materials 
each province has legislation and regulations designed to control hazardous waste generation  management and disposal 
movement of hazardous waste between canada and the united states is subject to the canada usa agreement on trans border movement of hazardous waste 
canada is a signatory to the basel convention  which governs international and some domestic activities of signatories 
in canada  responsibility and liability of the waste passes from the generator to the transporter or receiver of the waste  contrary to provisions of cercla in the united states 
services provided by the company the company provides a wide range of environmental services  and is managed as two major segments technical services and site services 
additional segment information can be found in the financial statements and the notes thereto appearing in item of this annual report on form k 
technical services include treatment and disposal of industrial wastes  which includes physical treatment  resource recovery and fuels blending  incineration  landfills  wastewater treatment  lab chemical disposal and explosives management  collection  transportation and logistics management  specialized packaging  transportation and disposal of laboratory chemicals and household hazardous wastes  which are referred to as cleanpack services  and apollo onsite services  which provides outsourced environmental programs management at customer sites 

table of contents these services are provided through a network of service centers where a fleet of trucks  rail or other transport is dispatched to pick up customers waste either on a pre determined schedule or on demand  and then to deliver waste to a permitted facility 
from the service centers  chemists can also be dispatched to a customer location for the collection of chemical waste for disposal 
site services provide highly skilled experts utilizing specialty equipment and resources to perform services  such as industrial maintenance  surface remediation  groundwater restoration  site and facility decontamination  emergency response  site remediation  transformer decommissioning  and oil disposal 
the company markets these services through its sales organizations and  in many instances services in one area of the business support or lead to work in other service lines 
the table below shows for each of the three years in the three year period ended december  the total revenues contributed by the company s principal lines of business in thousands years ended december  technical services site services other technical services treatment and disposal the company transports  treats and disposes of industrial wastes for commercial and industrial customers  health care providers  educational and research organizations  other environmental services companies and governmental entities 
the wastes handled include substances  which are classified as hazardous because of their corrosive  ignitable  infectious  reactive or toxic properties  and other substances subject to federal and state environmental regulation 
the company provides final treatment and disposal services designed to manage hazardous and non hazardous wastes  which cannot be otherwise economically recycled or reused 
the company operates a network of tsdfs that primarily focus on the collection of waste from smaller to mid size generators 
the tsdfs collect  temporarily store and or consolidate compatible waste streams for more efficient transportation to final recycling  treatment or disposal destinations 
tsdfs in the united states have part b permits under rcra that  among other things  allow the company to store waste for up to one year for bulking  treatment or transfer purposes 
larger customers typically ship directly to the end disposal sites with full truckloads of material 
depending upon the content  the material collected at the tsdfs is either disposed of at the company s incineration  landfill or wastewater treatment facilities  disposed of at end disposal facilities not owned by the company or recycled 
waste types processed or transferred in drums or bulk quantities include flammables  combustibles and other organics  acids and caustics  cyanides and sulfides  solids and sludges  industrial wastewaters  items containing pcbs  such as utility transformers and electrical light ballasts  
table of contents medical waste  other regulated wastes  and non hazardous industrial waste 
the company receives a detailed waste profile sheet prepared by the customer to document the nature of the customer s waste 
a sample of the delivered waste is tested to ensure that it conforms to the customer s waste profile record and to select an appropriate method of treatment and disposal 
once the wastes are characterized  compatible wastes are consolidated to achieve economies in storage  handling  transportation and ultimate treatment and disposal 
at the time of acceptance of a customer s waste at the company s facility  a unique computer bar code identification label is assigned to each container of waste  enabling the company to use sophisticated computer systems to track and document the status  location and disposition of the waste 
physical treatment 
physical treatment methods include distillation  separation and stabilization 
these methods are used to reduce the volume or toxicity of waste material or to make it suitable for further treatment  reuse  or disposal 
distillation uses either heat or vacuum to purify liquids for resale 
separation utilizes techniques such as sedimentation  filtration  flocculation and centrifugation to remove solid materials from liquids 
stabilization refers to a category of waste treatment processes designed to reduce contaminant mobility or solubility and convert waste to a more chemically stable form 
stabilization technology includes many classes of immobilization systems and applications 
stabilization is a frequent treatment method for metal bearing wastes received at several company facilities  which treat the waste to meet specific federal land disposal restrictions 
after treatment  the waste is tested to confirm that it has been rendered non hazardous 
it can then be sent to a non hazardous waste landfill  at significantly lower cost than disposal at a hazardous waste landfill 
resource recovery and fuels blending 
resource recovery involves the treatment of wastes using various methods  which effectively remove contaminants from the original material to restore its fitness for its intended purpose and to reduce the volume of waste requiring disposal 
the company operates treatment systems for the reclamation and reuse of certain wastes  particularly solvent based wastes generated by industrial cleaning operations  metal finishing and other manufacturing processes 
spent solvents that can be recycled are processed through thin film evaporators and other processing equipment and are distilled into usable products 
upon recovery of these products  the company either returns the recovered solvents to the original generator or sells them to third parties 
organic liquids and solids with sufficient heat value are blended to meet strict specifications for use as supplemental fuels for incinerators  cement kilns  industrial furnaces and other high efficiency boilers 
the company has installed fuels blending equipment at some tsdfs to prepare these supplemental fuels 
when possible  the company burns fuel blended material at company owned incinerators 
otherwise  the company sends the fuel blended material to supplemental fuel users that are licensed to accept the blended fuel material 
although the company pays a fee to the users who accept this product  this disposal method is substantially less costly than other disposal methods 
incineration 
incineration is the preferred method for the treatment of organic hazardous waste  because it effectively destroys the contaminants at temperatures in excess of  degrees fahrenheit 
high temperature incineration effectively eliminates organic wastes such as herbicides  halogenated solvents  pesticides  and pharmaceutical and refinery wastes  regardless of whether they are gases  liquids  sludges or solids 
federal and state incineration regulations require a destruction and removal efficiency of for most organic wastes and for pcbs and dioxin 
the company has five active incineration facilities which offer a wide range of technological capabilities to customers through this network

seasonality and cyclical nature of business the company s operations may be affected by seasonal fluctuations due to weather and budgetary cycles influencing the timing of customers spending for remedial activities 
typically during the first quarter of each year there is less demand for environmental services due to the cold weather  particularly in the northern and midwestern united states and canada 
the main reason for this effect is reduced volumes of waste being received at the company s facilities and higher operating costs associated with operating in sub freezing weather and high levels of snowfall 
in addition  factory closings for the year end holidays reduce the volume of industrial waste generated  which results in lower volumes of waste handled by the company during the first quarter of the following year 
the hazardous and industrial waste management business is cyclical to the extent that it is dependent upon a stream of waste from cyclical industries such as the chemical and petrochemical  primary metals  paper  furniture  aerospace and pharmaceutical industries 
if those cyclical industries slow significantly  the business that the company receives from those industries is likely to slow 
customers the company s principal customers are utility  chemical  petroleum  petrochemical  pharmaceutical  transportation and industrial firms  educational institutions  other environmental service companies and government agencies 
the company s sales efforts are directed toward establishing and maintaining relationships with businesses  which have ongoing requirements for one or more of the company s services 
the company s customer list includes many of the largest industrial companies in the united states 
management believes that the company s diverse customer base  in terms of number  industry and geographic location  as well as its large presence in north america  provide it with a recurring revenue base 
a majority of the company s revenues are derived from previously served customers with recurring needs for the company s services 
for the years ended december   and  no single customer accounted for more than of the company s revenues 
the company believes the loss of any single customer would not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
under applicable us environmental laws and regulations  generators of hazardous wastes retain legal liability for the proper handling of those wastes up to and including their ultimate disposal 
in response to these potential concerns  many large generators of industrial wastes and other purchasers of waste management services such as general contractors on major remediation projects have decreased the number of providers they use for such services 
the company has been selected as an approved vendor by large generators because the company possesses comprehensive collection  recycling  treatment  transportation  disposal  and waste tracking capabilities and has the expertise necessary to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations 
by becoming an approved vendor for a large waste generator or other purchaser  the company becomes eligible to provide waste management services to the multiple plants and projects of each generator or purchaser located in the company s service areas 
however  in order to obtain such approved vendor status  it may be necessary for the company to bid against other qualified competitors in terms of the services and pricing to be provided 
furthermore  large generators or other purchasers of waste management services often periodically audit the company s facilities and operations to ensure that the company s waste management services are being performed in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and other criteria established by the company and such customers 

table of contents geographical information for the year ended december   the company derived approximately  or of its revenues from customers located in the united states and puerto rico

this program includes installation of risk management systems at the company s facilities  such as fire suppression  employee training  environmental auditing and policy decisions restricting the types of wastes handled 
the company evaluates all revenue opportunities and declines those that it believes involve unacceptable risks 
the company disposes of its wastes at the company s incineration facilities  wastewater facilities  landfill facilities or at facilities owned and operated by other firms  which the company has audited and approved 
typically  the company applies established technologies to the treatment  storage and recovery of hazardous wastes 
the company believes its operations are conducted in a safe and prudent manner and in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations 
insurance and financial assurance the company s insurance programs cover the potential risks associated with its multifaceted operations from two primary exposures direct physical damage and third party liability 
the company maintains a casualty insurance program providing coverage for vehicles  workers compensation  employer s liability and commercial general liability in the aggregate amount of  per year  subject to a retention of  per occurrence 
the workers compensation limits are established by state statutes 
since the early s  casualty insurance policies have typically excluded liability for pollution  which is covered under a separate pollution liability program 
the company has pollution liability insurance policies covering the company s potential risk in three areas as a contractor performing services at customer sites  as a transporter of waste and for waste processing at the company s facilities 
the company has contractor s liability insurance of  per occurrence and  in the aggregate  covering off site remedial activities and associated liabilities 
the company has pollution liability coverage relating to bioremediation of  per occurence and in the aggregate 
steadfast insurance company a unit of zurich insurance na provides pollution liability coverage for waste in transit with single occurrence and aggregate liability limits of  this steadfast policy covers liability in excess of  for pollution caused by sudden and accidental occurrences during transportation of waste  from the time waste is picked up from a customer until its delivery to the final disposal site 
federal and state regulations require liability insurance coverage for all facilities that treat  store or dispose of hazardous waste 
rcra and the toxic substances control act and comparable state hazardous waste regulations typically require hazardous waste handling facilities to maintain pollution liability insurance in the amount of  per occurrence and  in the aggregate for sudden occurrences  and  per occurrence and  in the aggregate for non sudden occurrences 
the company has a policy from steadfast insurance company insuring the company s treatment  storage and disposal activities that meets the regulatory requirements 
in addition  this policy provides excess limits above the regulatory requirements up to  
table of contents under the company s insurance programs  coverage is obtained for catastrophic exposures  as well as those risks required to be insured by law or contract 
it is the policy of the company to retain a significant portion of certain expected losses related primarily to employee benefit  workers compensation  commercial general and vehicle liability 
provisions for losses expected under these programs are recorded based upon the company s estimates of the aggregate liability for claims 
the company believes that policy cancellation terms are similar to those of other companies in other industries 
operators of hazardous waste handling facilities are also required by federal and state regulations to provide financial assurance for closure and post closure care of those facilities should the facilities cease operation 
closure would include the cost of removing the waste stored at a facility which ceased operating and sending the material to another facility for disposal and the cost of performing certain procedures for decontamination of the facilities 
total closure and post closure financial assurance required by regulators is approximately  the company has placed most of the required financial assurance for closure through a qualified insurance company  which as part of the policy required the company to issue approximately million of letters of credit as collateral 
at december   the company had posted letters of credit related to closure and post closure liability financial assurance of  and is required to post additional letters of credit of  in the company utilizes its captive insurance company to provide financial assurance for the lagoons located at the chicago facility 
the company s ability to continue conducting its industrial waste management operations could be adversely affected if the company should become unable to obtain sufficient insurance or surety bonds to meet its business and regulatory requirements in the future 
the availability of insurance may also be influenced by developments within the insurance industry  although other businesses in the environmental services industry would likely be similarly impacted by such developments 
environmental regulation while the company s business has benefited substantially from increased governmental regulation of hazardous waste transportation  storage and disposal  the environmental services industry itself has become the subject of extensive and evolving regulation by federal  state and local authorities 
the company is required to obtain federal  state  provincial and local permits  or approvals for each of its hazardous waste facilities 
such permits are difficult to obtain and  in many instances  extensive studies  tests  and public hearings are required before the approvals can be issued 
the company has acquired all operating permits and approvals now required for the current operation of its business  and has applied for or is in the process of applying for  all permits and approvals needed in connection with continued operation and planned expansion or modifications of its operations 
the company makes a continuing effort to anticipate regulatory  political and legal developments that might affect its operations  but is not always able to do so 
the company cannot predict the extent to which any environmental legislation or regulation that may be enacted or enforced in the future may affect its operations 
federal regulation of hazardous waste the most significant federal environmental laws affecting the company are the resource conservation and recovery act rcra  the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla  also known as the superfund act  the clean air act  the clean water act and the toxic substances control act tsca 
rcra 
rcra is the principal federal statute governing hazardous waste generation  treatment  transportation  storage and disposal 
pursuant to rcra  the epa has established a comprehensive  cradle to grave system for the management of a wide range of materials identified as hazardous waste 
states that have 
table of contents adopted hazardous waste management programs with standards at least as stringent as those promulgated by the epa  have been delegated authority by the epa to administer their facility permitting programs in lieu of the epa s program 
every facility that treats  stores or disposes of hazardous waste must obtain a rcra permit from the epa or an authorized state agency  unless a specific exemption exists  and must comply with certain operating requirements 
under rcra  hazardous waste management facilities in existence on november  were required to submit a preliminary permit application to the epa  the so called part a application 
by virtue of this filing  a facility obtained interim status  allowing it to operate until licensing proceedings are instituted pursuant to more comprehensive and exacting regulations the part b permitting process 
interim status facilities may continue to operate pursuant to the part a application until their part b permitting process is concluded 
rcra requires that part b permits contain provisions for required on site study and cleanup activities  known as corrective action  including detailed compliance schedules and provisions for assurance of financial responsibility 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  environmental liabilities for a discussion of the company s environmental liabilities 
see insurance and financial assurance above for a discussion of the company s financial assurance requirements 
the superfund act 
the superfund act is the primary federal statute regulating the cleanup of inactive hazardous substance sites and imposing liability for cleanup on the responsible parties 
it also provides for immediate response and removal actions coordinated by the epa to releases of hazardous substances into the environment  and authorizes the government to respond to the release or threatened release of hazardous substances or to order persons responsible for any such release to perform any necessary cleanup 
the statute assigns joint and several liability for these responses and other related costs  including the cost of damage to natural resources  to the parties involved in the generation  transportation and disposal of such hazardous substances 
under the statute  the company may be deemed liable as a generator or transporter of a hazardous substance which is released into the environment  or as the owner or operator of a facility from which there is a release of a hazardous substance into the environment 
see item  legal proceedings for a description of certain such proceedings involving the company 
the clean air act 
the clean air act was passed by congress to control the emissions of pollutants into the air and requires permits to be obtained for certain sources of toxic air pollutants such as vinyl chloride  or criteria pollutants  such as carbon monoxide 
in  congress amended the clean air act to require further reductions of air pollutants with specific targets for non attainment areas in order to meet certain ambient air quality standards 
these amendments also require the epa to promulgate regulations  which i control emissions of hazardous air pollutants  ii create uniform operating permits for major industrial facilities similar to rcra operating permits  iii mandate the phase out of ozone depleting chemicals  and iv provide for enhanced enforcement 
the clean air act requires epa  working with the states  to develop and implement regulations  which result in the reduction of volatile organic compound voc emissions and emissions of nitrogen oxides nox in order to meet certain ozone air quality standards specified by the clean air act 
in late  texas natural resource conservation commission tnrcc enacted new clean air act regulations dealing with the monitoring and control of emissions of nox and vocs 
these new regulations were required because of a revision in the designation of the houston metropolitan area from a serious ozone non attainment area to a severe ozone non attainment area 
this new designation will require the company s deer park  texas incineration facility to further reduce emissions of nox 
nox emissions contribute to the formation of ground level ozone  which can be harmful to human health and the environment 
the interim standards of the hazardous waste combustor maximum achievable control technology the hwc mact rule of the clean air act amendments  promulgated on february   are identical to the 
table of contents technology based emission standards originally promulgated on september  these rules established new emission limits and operational controls on all new and existing incinerators  cement kilns  industrial boilers and light weight aggregate kilns that burn hazardous waste derived fuel 
facilities subject to the hwc mact rule must comply with the new emission standards by september   or they can apply for an extension with compliance being required by september  as further discussed below under compliance with environmental regulations  the company will be required to expend significant funds in order to bring its deer park  texas and aragonite  utah incineration facilities into compliance with the new rules 
management believes that some facilities owned by others may not find it economical to upgrade to the new standards  which could result in the closure of some facilities 
this could result in a reduction of incineration capacity and lead to improved pricing for incineration 
however  no assurance can be given that this will happen 
promulgation of final standards for the hwc mact must occur by june   however  it is not now possible to forecast the impact of the final standards on future operations  earnings or capital investments 
clean water act 
this legislation prohibits discharges into the waters of the united states without governmental authorization and regulates the discharge of pollutants into surface waters and sewers from a variety of sources  including disposal sites and treatment facilities 
the epa has promulgated pretreatment regulations under the clean water act  which establish pretreatment standards for introduction of pollutants into publicly owned treatment works potw 
in the course of its treatment process  the company s wastewater treatment facilities generate wastewater  which they discharge to potw pursuant to permits issued by the appropriate governmental authority 
the company is required to obtain discharge permits and conduct sampling and monitoring programs 
the company believes each of its operating facilities complies in all material respects with the applicable requirements 
in december  the epa promulgated new effluent limitations  pretreatment standards and source performance standards for centralized waste treatment cwt facilities 
cwt facilities receive and treat a wide variety of hazardous and non hazardous waste waters from off site companies and discharge the treated water directly to waterways or to municipal sewer systems 
the new rules set stringent limits for the discharge of metals  organic compounds and oil 
a number of the company s wastewater treatment facilities are affected by the new rules and must be in compliance with the discharge standards by december several of the affected facilities already are in compliance with the cwt discharge standards  and the company is working on bringing the other facilities into compliance with the new regulations 
the company does not believe that complying with the new standards will materially adversely affect results from operations 
tsca 
the company also operates a network of collection  treatment and field services remediation activities throughout north america that are regulated under provisions of the tsca 
tsca established a national program for the management of substances classified as pcbs  which include waste pcbs as well as rcra wastes contaminated with pcbs 
the rules set minimum design and operating requirements for storage  treatment and disposal of pcb wastes 
since their initial publication  the rules have been modified to enhance the management standards for tsca regulated operations including the decommissioning of pcb transformers and articles  detoxification of transformer oils  incineration of pcb liquids and solids  landfill disposal of pcb solids  and remediation of pcb contamination at customer sites 
other federal laws 
in addition to regulations specifically directed at the treatment  storage  and disposal facilities  there are a number of regulations that may pass through to the facilities based on the acceptance of regulated waste from affected client facilities 
each facility that accepts affected waste must comply with the regulations for that waste  facility or industry 
examples of this type of regulation are national emission standards for benzene waste operations and national emissions standards for pharmaceuticals production 
each facility will address these regulations on a case by case basis determined by the ability to comply with the pass through regulations 

table of contents in its transportation operations  the company is regulated by the us department of transportation  the federal railroad administration  and the us coast guard  as well as by the regulatory agencies of each state in which it operates or through which its vehicles pass 
health and safety standards under the osha are applicable to all operations of the company 
this includes both the technical services and site services operations 
state and local regulations pursuant to the epa s authorization of their rcra equivalent programs  a number of states have regulatory programs governing the operations and permitting of hazardous waste facilities 
accordingly  the hazardous waste treatment  storage and disposal activities of a number of the company s facilities are regulated by the relevant state agencies in addition to federal epa regulation 
some states classify as hazardous some wastes which are not regulated under rcra 
for example  massachusetts considers used oil as hazardous wastes while rcra does not 
accordingly  the company must comply with state requirements for handling state regulated wastes  and  when necessary  obtain state licenses for treating  storing  and disposing of such wastes at its facilities 
the company believes that each of its facilities is in substantial compliance with the applicable requirements of rcra  state laws and regulations 
once issued  such licenses have maximum fixed terms of a given number of years  which differ from state to state  ranging from three years to ten years 
the issuing state agency may review or modify a license at any time during its term 
the company anticipates that once a license is issued with respect to a facility  the license will be renewed at the end of its term if the facility s operations are in compliance with applicable requirements 
however  there can be no assurance that regulations governing future licensing will remain static  or that the company will be able to comply with such requirements 
the company s wastewater treatment facilities are also subject to state and local regulation  most significantly sewer discharge regulations adopted by the municipalities  which receive treated wastewater from the treatment processes 
the company s continued ability to operate its liquid waste treatment process at each such facility is dependent upon its ability to continue these sewer discharges 
the company s facilities are regulated pursuant to state statutes  including those addressing clean water and clean air 
local sewer discharge and flammable storage requirements are applicable to certain of the company s facilities 
the company s facilities are subject to local siting  zoning and land use restrictions 
although the company s facilities occasionally have been cited for regulatory violations  the company believes it is in substantial compliance with all federal  state and local laws regulating its business 
canadian hazardous waste regulation in canada  the provinces retain control over environmental issues within their boundaries and thus have the primary responsibility for regulating management of hazardous wastes 
the federal government regulates issues of national scope  or where activities cross provincial boundaries 
provincial regulations 
to a greater or lesser extent  provinces have enacted legislation and developed regulations to fit their needs 
most of canada s industrial development and the major part of its population can be found in four provinces ontario  quebec  alberta and british columbia 
it is in these provinces that the most detailed environmental regulations are found 
the company operates major waste management facilities in each of these provinces  as well as waste transfer facilities in nova scotia and manitoba 
the main provincial acts dealing with hazardous waste management are ontario environmental protection act 
table of contents quebec environmental quality act alberta environmental protection and enhancement act british columbia waste management act 
these pieces of legislation were developed by the provinces totally independently and  among other things  generally control the generation  characterization  transport  treatment and disposal of hazardous wastes 
regulations developed by the provinces under the relevant legislation are also developed independently  but are often quite similar in effect and sometimes in application 
for example  there is some uniformity in manifest design and utilization 
provincial legislation also provides for the establishment of waste management facilities 
in this case  the facilities are also controlled by provincial statutes and regulations governing emissions to air  groundwater and surface water and prescribing design criteria and operational guidelines 
waste transporters require a permit to operate under provincial waste management regulations and are subject to the requirements of the federal transportation of dangerous goods legislation 
they are required to report the quantities and disposition of materials shipped 
within the provincial regulations  definitions of hazardous wastes are quite similar 
wastes can be defined as hazardous based on origin or characteristic and the descriptions or parameters involved are very similar to those in effect in the united states 
a major difference between the united states regulatory regime and those in canada relates to ownership and liability 
under canadian provincial regulations  ownership changes when waste is transferred to a properly permitted third party carrier and subsequently to an approved treatment and disposal facility 
this means that the generator is no longer liable for improper handling  treatment or disposal  responsibility having been transferred to the carrier or the facility 
exceptions may occur if the carrier is working under contract to the generator or if the waste is different from that which was originally contracted among the parties 
canadian federal regulations 
the federal government has authority for those matters  which are national in scope and in impact and for canada s relations with other nations 
the main federal laws governing hazardous waste management are canadian environmental protection act  cepa transportation of dangerous goods act environment canada is the federal agency with responsibility for environmental matters and the main legislative instrument is the canadian environmental protection act 
this act charges environment canada and health canada with protection of human health and the environment and seeks to control the production  importation and use of substances in canada and to control their impact on the environment 
the export and import of hazardous wastes regulations under cepa control the export and import of hazardous wastes and hazardous recyclable materials 
by reference  these regulations incorporate the transportation of dangerous goods act and regulations  which address identification  packaging  marking and documentation of hazardous materials during transport 
cepa requires that anyone proposing to export or import hazardous wastes or hazardous recyclable materials or to transport them through canada notify the minister of the environment and obtain a permit to do so 
section of cepa allows the federal government to enter into administrative agreements with the provinces and territories for the development and improvement of environmental standards 
these agreements represent co operation towards a common goal rather than a delegation of authority under cepa to facilitate the development of provincial and territorial agreements  the federal  provincial and territorial governments participate in the canadian council of ministers of the 
table of contents environment ccme 
the council comprises the environment ministers from the federal  provincial and territorial governments  who normally meet twice a year to discuss national environmental priorities and to determine work to carried out under the auspices of ccme 
canadian local and municipal regulations 
local and municipal regulations seldom reference direct control of hazardous waste management activities 
municipal regulations and by laws  however  control such issues as land use designation  access to municipal services and use of emergency services  all of which can have a significant impact on facility operation 
compliance with environmental regulations the company incurs costs and makes capital investments in order to comply with the previously discussed environmental regulations 
these regulations require that the company remediate environmental liabilities which almost entirely consist of certain environmental liabilities assumed as part of the csd assets acquired  operate the facilities in accordance with enacted regulations  obtain required financial assurance for closure and post closure care of the facilities should the facilities cease operations  make capital investments in order to keep facilities in compliance with environmental regulations and defend itself in legal proceedings including environmental proceedings 
as further discussed in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the headings acquisition and environmental liabilities  the company assumed  relating to the acquisition of the csd assets  environmental liabilities valued in accordance with gaap of approximately  for the year ended december   the company spent  relating to accrued environmental liabilities 
almost all of the spending related to the environmental liabilities assumed as part of the acquisition of the csd assets 
for the year ended december   the company anticipates spending  relating to the company s environmental liabilities 
as discussed more fully in item  business  under the heading insurance and financial assurance  the company is required to provide financial assurance with respect to certain statutorily required closure  post closure and corrective action obligations at its facilities 
the company has placed most of the required financial assurance for facility closure and post closure monitoring with a qualified insurance company 
in addition to the direct cost of the financial assurance  the policy requires that letters of credit of approximately million be issued as collateral for the financial assurance policy 
the letter of credit facility agreement under which the letters of credit are issued requires the company to post cash collateral of of the amount of outstanding letters of credit 
the company incurs significant costs in posting collateral due to the company borrowing funds under its financing arrangements at interest rates ranging from the prime rate at december  to  while the company earns interest on the cash collateral at money market rates at december  
as previously discussed under environmental regulation  the company s united states based hazardous waste incinerators must be in compliance with the epa s hwc mact interim standards by september   or if an extension is sought  by september  for the year ended december   capital expenditures relating to complying with environmental regulations totaled  which primarily related with complying with the hwc mact interim standards 
the company estimates that capital expenditures for relating to complying with environmental regulations will be  which once again primarily relate to complying with the interim standards 
in addition to the costs of complying with environmental regulations  hazardous waste treatment companies  as discussed more fully in item  legal proceedings  are generally involved in legal proceedings as well as environmental proceedings in the ordinary course of business 
alleged failure by the company to comply with laws and regulations may lead to the imposition of fines or the denial  revocation or delay of the renewal of 
table of contents permits and licenses by governmental entities 
in addition  such governmental entities  as well as surrounding landowners  may claim that the company is liable for environmental damages 
citizens groups have become increasingly active in challenging the grant or renewal of permits and licenses for hazardous waste facilities and responding to such challenges has further increased the costs associated with establishing new facilities or expanding current facilities 
a significant judgment against the company  the loss of a significant permit or license or the imposition of a significant fine could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and future prospects

item legal proceedings general environmental matters the company s waste services are continuously regulated by federal  state  provincial and local laws enacted to regulate the handling  transportation  storage and disposal of hazardous waste materials or otherwise protect the environment 
this ongoing regulation results in the company frequently becoming a party to judicial or administrative proceedings involving all levels of governmental authorities and other interested parties 
the issues involved in such proceedings generally relate to applications for permits and licenses by the company and conformity with legal requirements and alleged violations of existing permits and licenses 
at december   the company was involved in various proceedings in which a governmental authority is a party primarily involving activities at and or shipments to or from the company s waste treatment  storage and disposal facilities 
the principal proceedings are described below 
legal proceedings related to csd assets 
effective september  the closing date  the company purchased from safety kleen services  inc and certain of its domestic subsidiaries collectively  the sellers substantially all of the assets of the chemical services division the csd of safety kleen corp 
safety kleen  except for safety kleen s pinewood facility near the town of pinewood in sumter county  south carolina 
the company purchased the csd assets pursuant to a sale order the sale order issued by the bankruptcy court for the district of delaware which has jurisdiction over the chapter proceedings involving the sellers  and the company therefore took title to the csd assets without assumption of any liability including pending or threatened litigation of the sellers except as expressly provided in the sale order 
however  under the sale order which incorporated by reference certain provisions of the acquisition agreement between the company and safety kleen services  inc  the company became subject to certain legal proceedings involving the csd assets for three reasons as described below 
as of december   the company had reserves which the company had established as part of the purchase price for the csd assets of million relating to the company s estimated potential liabilities in connection with such legal proceedings 
the company continues to gather information about the legal proceedings surrounding certain environmental liabilities acquired 
as information about these proceedings becomes available to the company  the company may record additional liabilities as part of the purchase price allocation 
liabilities may be recorded based on information gathered or based on management s plan to settle these matters 
for certain reasons described below under the headings ville mercier legal proceedings and marine shale processors  reserves at december   do not include any amounts with respect to the company s potential future liabilities which may arise from the legal proceedings described under those headings 
the first reason for the company s assumption of certain legal proceedings in connection with the acquisition of the csd assets is that  as part of the csd assets  the company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of certain canadian subsidiaries the csd canadian subsidiaries formerly owned by the sellers which subsidiaries were not part of the sellers bankruptcy proceedings  and the company therefore became subject to the legal proceedings which include the ville mercier proceedings described below in which the 
table of contents canadian subsidiaries are now or may in the future become involved 
the second reason is that there are ongoing legal proceedings which include the fusrap legal proceedings described below which  while the company will not be responsible for damages or other liabilities of the sellers relating to such proceedings  may nevertheless affect the future operation of certain of the csd assets 
the third reason is that  as part of the purchase price for the csd assets  the company agreed with the sellers that the company will assume and pay certain current and future liabilities of the sellers under applicable federal and state environmental laws including  in particular  the sellers share of cleanup costs payable to governmental entities for certain sites where one or more of the sellers has been named or may in the future be named as a potentially responsible party prp under the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act superfund act or analogous state superfund laws 
the principal legal proceedings in which the company became involved as a result of its acquisition of the csd assets are as follows ville mercier legal proceedings 
one of the csd canadian subsidiaries the mercier subsidiary owns and operates a hazardous waste incinerator in ville mercier  quebec the mercier facility 
a portion of the mercier facility is now contaminated as a result of actions dating back to  when the quebec government issued two permits to the unrelated company which then owned the mercier facility to dump organic liquids into lagoons on the property 
by  groundwater contamination had been identified  and the quebec government provided an alternate water supply to the municipality of ville mercier 
also in  the quebec government terminated the permit authorizing the dumping of liquids on the site of the mercier facility  but issued a permit to operate an organic liquids incinerator on the property and contracted with the then owner of the property to incinerate the pumpable liquids in the lagoons 
in  the incinerator operator removed  solidified and disposed of the non pumpable material from the lagoons in a secure cell and completed the closure of the lagoons at its own expense 
in  the quebec government constructed and continues to operate a groundwater pumping and treatment facility near the lagoons 
the company believes that the mercier subsidiary is not the party responsible for the lagoon and groundwater contamination on the site of the mercier facility  and the mercier subsidiary continues to deny under applicable canadian environmental laws any responsibility for the decontamination and restoration of the site 
in november  the minister of the environment ordered the mercier subsidiary to take all the necessary measures to excavate  eliminate or treat all of the contaminated soils and residues and to recover and treat all of the contaminated waters resulting from the aforementioned measures 
the mercier subsidiary responded by letter  reiterating its position that it had no responsibility for the contamination and proposing to submit the question of responsibility to the courts for determination as expeditiously as possible 
on january   the mercier subsidiary filed a declaratory judgment action safety kleen services mercier ltd 
v 
attorney general of quebec  pierre paradis  in his capacity as minister of the environment of quebec  ville mercier  and lasalle oil carriers  inc in the superior court for the province of quebec  district of montreal 
the legal proceeding seeks a court determination of the liability associated with the contamination of former lagoons located on the ville mercier property 
the mercier subsidiary asserts that it has no responsibility for the contamination on the site 
the minister filed a defense and counterclaim in which he asserts that the mercier subsidiary is responsible for the contamination  should reimburse the province of quebec for past costs incurred in the amount of million cdn  and should be responsible for future remediation costs 
this legal proceeding is still in the discovery stage 
in addition to the declaratory judgment action  ville mercier and three neighboring municipalities filed on or about february and march  separate legal proceedings against the mercier subsidiary and certain related companies together with certain former officers and directors  as well as against the government of quebec ville mercier v 
safety kleen services mercier ltd  et al  ville de chateauguay v 
safety kleen services mercier ltd  et al  municipality of ste martine v 
safety kleen services mercier ltd  et al  and st 
paul de chateauguay v 
safety kleen services mercier ltd  et al the lawsuits assert that the defendants are jointly and severally responsible for the contamination of groundwater in the region  which the plaintiffs 
table of contents claim was caused by contamination from the former ville mercier lagoons  and which they claim caused each municipality to incur additional costs to supply drinking water for their citizens since the s and early s 
the four municipalities claim a total of million cdn as damages for additional costs to obtain drinking water supplies and seek an injunctive order to obligate the defendants to remediate the groundwater in the region 
the mercier subsidiary continues to assert that it has no responsibility for the groundwater contamination in the region 
this legal proceeding is in the discovery stage 
the continued conduct of such proceedings by the mercier subsidiary which is now owned by the company would require the company to incur legal and other costs and the uncertainties inherent in any such legal proceedings 
accordingly  as part of its integration plan for the csd assets acquired in september  the company intends to pursue settlement discussions with the governmental entities in canada which are parties to such legal proceedings 
the company cannot now predict whether such discussions will result in a settlement of the legal proceedings or  if such a settlement can be reached  the amount of the company s potential payment under such a settlement 
accordingly  the company believes that the amount of any remedial liability which the company may have with respect to the mercier facility is not estimable at this time 
fusrap legal proceeding 
as part of the csd assets  the company acquired a hazardous waste landfill in buttonwillow  california the buttonwillow landfill 
during and  the seller s subsidiary which then owned the buttonwillow landfill the buttonwillow seller accepted and disposed in the buttonwillow landfill certain construction debris the fusrap wastes that originated at a site in new york that was part of the federal formerly utilized sites remedial action program fusrap 
fusrap was created in the mid s in an attempt to manage various sites around the country contaminated with residual radioactivity from activities conducted by the atomic energy commission and the united states military during world war ii 
the fusrap wastes are primarily construction and demolition debris exhibiting low activity residual radioactivity that were shipped to the buttonwillow landfill by us army corps of engineers 
the california department of health services dhs has claimed in a letter to the buttonwillow seller that the buttonwillow seller did not lawfully accept the fusrap wastes under applicable california law and regulations 
both dhs and the california department of toxic substances control dtsc filed claims in the sellers bankruptcy proceedings preserving the right of those agencies to claim penalties for damages against the buttonwillow seller and possibly seeking to compel removal of the fusrap wastes from the buttonwillow landfill 
however  the specified agencies are still investigating whether they believe the buttonwillow seller violated any california law or regulation and  aside from the letter to the buttonwillow seller and the filing of the proofs of claim in the sellers bankruptcy proceedings  the california agencies have not commenced any enforcement proceedings relating to the buttonwillow landfill 
under the sale order  the company is not liable for penalties  if any  which the buttonwillow seller might ultimately be determined to owe to the dhs and dtsc  but the company could potentially be liable for removal costs if such agencies were ultimately to succeed in a claim that the fusrap wastes were improperly disposed of at the buttonwillow landfill and should be removed 
the company estimates the cost of removing the fusrap wastes from the buttonwillow landfill would be approximately million 
however  both the seller and the company believe that the fusrap wastes were properly  safely and lawfully disposed of at the buttonwillow landfill under all applicable laws and regulations and they will vigorously resist any efforts to require that such wastes be removed 
the company has not accrued any costs of removing the fusrap wastes because the company believes that only a remote possibility exists that a final order will be issued requiring the company to remove such wastes 
tanner act proceeding 
in the conditional use permit cup issued by kern county  california for the seller s buttonwillow landfill was challenged by a local interest group  padres hacia una vida mejor and its individual members 
the proceeding was initiated under the tanner act  a unique california statute that enables citizens to appeal local land use decisions regarding hazardous waste facilities under california health and safety code sections 
under the tanner act  the governor or a designee  upon making certain findings  must appoint a member appeal board that is empowered to convene hearings and if necessary require the local agency to modify its land use decision in accordance with the appeal board decision 

table of contents the appeal process involves two phases  a preliminary hearing to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to proceed to a hearing and  if so  a hearing to deterine whether the conditions imposed by the local agency are inadequate 
in the buttonwillow proceeding  the preliminary hearings were held intermittently from november through may the appeal board issued its preliminary hearing decision on july  the appeal board rejected nine of the ten issues submitted to it by the petitioners 
the appeal board decided that one issue should proceed to a full hearing  namely issue y  which challenges a permit condition that establishes certain limits on the disposal of radioactive waste at the facility 
in the full hearing to be held on issue y  the appeal board must determine whether there is clear and convincing evidence that the provision in the cup governing the receipt of radioactive waste fails to protect the public health  safety  or welfare 
the hearing phase of the proceeding has not yet been scheduled 
the next status conference is scheduled for april  the company has convened a panel of experts to review the technical issues and is prepared to vigorously present its case to the appeal board 
the parties are also currently engaged in vigorous settlement negotiations 
the outcome of the proceeding cannot be predicted nor can a range of probable loss be estimated  accordingly  the company has not recorded any liability relating to the proceeding 
assumption of certain csd superfund liabilities 
the company s agreement to pay as part of the purchase price for the csd assets the sellers share of certain cleanup costs payable to governmental entities under federal and state superfund laws relate primarily to i certain potential liabilities which the sellers might incur in the future in connection with an incinerator formerly operated by marine shale processors to which the sellers shipped hazardous wastes  ii two properties included in the csd assets which are now subject to superfund proceedings and for which one or more of the sellers has been designated a prp  iii active superfund sites owned by third parties where the sellers have been designated as prps  and iv several inactive superfund sites owned by third parties where the sellers have been named as prps but as to which the sellers and the company believe the sellers have no significant liabilities 
federal and state superfund laws generally impose joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up superfund sites not only upon the owners and operators of such sites  but also upon persons or entities which in the past have either generated or shipped hazardous wastes to such sites 
accordingly  the superfund laws encourage prps to agree to share in specified percentages of the aggregate cleanup costs for superfund sites by entering into consent decrees  settlement agreements or similar arrangements 
non settling prps may be liable for any shortfalls in government cost recovery and may be liable to other prps for equitable contribution 
under the superfund laws  a settling prp s financial liability could increase if the other settling prps were to become insolvent or if additional or more severe contamination were discovered at the relevant site 
the company has estimated and accrued the amount of those sellers liabilities  if the liability is both estimable and probable  which the company agreed to assume for cleanup costs at superfund sites where one or more of the sellers has been designated as a prp by reviewing any existing consent decrees  settlement agreements or similar arrangements with respect to those sites and the sellers negotiated volumetric share of liability where applicable 
in estimating the amount of its assumed liability  the company used its prior knowledge of the relevant sites and its general experience in dealing with the cleanup of superfund sites 
marine shale processors 
beginning in the mid s and continuing until july  marine shale processors  inc  located in amelia  louisiana marine shale  operated a kiln which incinerated waste producing a vitrified aggregate as a by product 
marine shale contended that its operation recycled waste into a useful product  ie  vitrified aggregate  and therefore was exempt from regulation under the resource conservation recovery act rcra and permitting requirements as a hazardous waste incinerator under applicable federal and state environmental laws 
the epa contended that marine shale was a sham recycler subject to the regulation and permitting requirements as a hazardous waste incinerator under rcra  that its vitrified aggregate by product was a hazardous waste  and that marine shale s continued operation without required permits was illegal 
litigation between the epa and marine shale began in and continued until july when the us fifth circuit court of appeals ordered marine shale to shut down its operations 
during the course of its operation  marine shale produced thousands of tons of aggregate  some of which was sold as fill material at various locations in the vicinity of amelia  louisiana  but most of which is was stockpiled on the premises of the marine shale facility 
almost all of this aggregate has since been moved to a nearby property 
table of contents owned by an affiliate of marine shale  known as recycling park  inc in accordance with a court order authorizing the movement of this material to this off site location  all of the materials located at recycling park  inc comply with the land disposal restrictions of rcra 
approximately  tons of aggregate remains on the marine shale site 
moreover  as a result of past operations  soil and groundwater contamination may exist on the marine shale site 
in november  earthlock technologies  inc earthlock  formerly known as gtx  inc  acquired an option to buy marine shale with the intent to operate the facility as a permitted hazardous waste incinerator 
subsequently  marine shale  earthlock and the epa reached a settlement  including a required cleanup of the aggregate and the facility  and the louisiana department of environmental quality the ldeq issued a draft permit to earthlock for operation of the marine shale facility as a rcra permitted hazardous waste incinerator 
opposition parties filed appeals and in october  a louisiana state court judge ruled that the draft permit was improperly issued 
earthlock appealed this decision and in october  the appeals court reversed the lower court and affirmed the permit issuance 
the opposition parties filed applications for supervisory writs with the louisiana supreme court  and these applications were denied in april however  earthlock subsequently announced in april that it did not intend to proceed with the proposed transaction  and on october   marine shale notified the ldeq that marine shale will close the facility in accordance with a page closure plan originally filed with the ldeq in march subsequently  on december   earthlock sent a letter to the ldeq through one of its attorneys  disclosing that earthlock has ceased and abandoned all efforts to reopen the hazardous waste business and facility in amelia 
the letter also states that earthlock was relinquishing its permits for air emissions  water discharges  and for managing hazardous wastes 
although the sellers never held an equity interest in marine shale  the sellers were reportedly among the largest customers of marine shale in terms of overall incineration revenue 
in the event marine shale does not have adequate funding to shut down the facility and complete the required cleanup  the potential exists for an epa or ldeq action requiring cleanup of the marine shale site and the stockpiled aggregate under applicable superfund laws 
in that event  the sellers could be exposed to potential financial liability for their proportionate share of clean up costs  and the company might then be obligated to pay all or a portion of the sellers proportionate share of liability in accordance with superfund laws and the company s agreement to assume certain of the sellers superfund liabilities to governmental entities 
the company now estimates that the total cost of removing all of the vitrified aggregate from the marine shale site and recycling park  inc and disposing of the aggregate at a properly licensed hazardous waste facility is approximately to million  and the ldeq has estimated the total closure costs for the marine shale site at approximately million 
the company believes there are a number of other financially solvent potential prps at the two sites that would be responsible for paying their proportionate shares of the cleanup and remediation costs  and would also be required to participate in the overall site cleanup efforts 
in addition  on march   the us department of justice announced that a proposed stipulation of settlement and judgment stipulation was lodged with the us district court for the western district of louisiana  in the lawsuit captioned as united states of america and state of louisiana v 
marine shale processors  inc  et al  civil action no 
cv  pertaining to the marine shale facility and the recycling park  inc property 
the stipulation provides for payment of all funds currently on deposit in the registry of the court to the ldeq  for deposit in an escrow account  and subsequent expenditure of these funds solely for closure and remediation of contamination at the marine shale facility and or the recycling park  inc property 
the balance of the funds in the court registry totaled  as of december  in addition  a standby irrevocable letter of credit of approximately  exists to pay for closure of the marine shale facility  which is payable to the ldeq as beneficiary 
thus  approximately  will be available to pay for closure and remediation of contamination at the marine shale facility and or the recycling park  inc property from these existing sources of funding 
the company is not aware of any cost estimates that include cleanup or remediation costs associated with the marine shale site 
until such time as the company can obtain more complete information as to the potential status of the 
table of contents marine shale site as a superfund site  the costs associated with removal and disposal of the vitrified aggregate and closure and remediation of the marine shale site  and the respective shares of other potential prp s  the company believes that the amount of any remedial liability which the company may incur in the future with respect to the marine shale site is not estimable at this time 
properties included in csd assets 
the two properties included in the csd assets which are now subject to superfund proceedings and for which one or more the sellers has been designated as a prp are located at north new york street in wichita  kansas the north new york street property  and at burton road in lexington  south carolina the burton road property 
the north new york street property is an active service center which is one of several properties located within the boundaries of a  acre state designated superfund site in an old industrial section of wichita known as the north industrial corridor site 
the sellers have executed a consent decree relating to such site with the epa  and the company will continue its ongoing remediation program for the north new york street property 
the cost of the superfund remediation and the company s respective share of the north new york street property are not currently estimable  as such  the company has not recorded a liability for this superfund site 
the burton road property is now vacant but was formerly operated by the sellers as a waste transfer and truck cleaning facility  and the property is located within the boundaries of a state designated superfund site known as the hollis road site 
in june  the south carolina department of health and environmental control dhec initiated a lawsuit against the sellers and two other parties that owned or operated facilities within the hollis road site boundaries 
the lawsuit seeks a declaration of liability for causing contamination of the hollis road site against the sellers and the other named defendants  in addition to the recovery of past and future remediation costs  recovery of natural resources damages and treble damages 
dhec estimates the total remediation costs for the hollis road site to be approximately million and the natural resources damages to be about million and claims to have spent approximately million at the site to date  including costs to install public water supply lines to about residences in the hollis road area 
on february  the company and two subsidiaries of the seller entered into a consent decree with the dhec settling the south carolina claims and lawsuit with respect to the hollis road superfund site and the burton road property 
the consent decree and an accompanying complaint against the company were filed with the united states district court for south carolina on march  the consent decree provides that the company must make two installment payments to dhec 
the first payment of  is to be paid when the consent decree is filed with the court and the second payment of  is to be paid one year later 
the consent decree contains a customary covenant not to sue and contribution protection provisions for the company  and also contains a limited re opener provision 
the re opener provision would require the company to perform soils remediation work within the boundaries of its burton road property if new releases or spills were to occur or if there was independently verifiable data to substantiate that a specified contaminant or its degradation products were discovered above certain concentration levels in the soils at the burton road property 
at this time the company is aware of no data which identifies such contamination at the burton road property 
before becoming final  the consent decree must be approved by the court following a public comment period which commenced on or about march  although no assurances can be given  the company anticipates that the consent decree will be approved by the court 
at december   the company has accrued for the payments to be made under the consent decree 
active third party superfund sites 
prior to the closing date  the sellers had shipped hazardous wastes to an aggregate of sites owned and then operated by third parties which have subsequently been designated as federal or state superfund sites and for which the sellers  along with other parties  have been designated as prps 
at of those sites  the sellers have addressed their cleanup obligations to the federal and state governments and to other prps by entering into consent decrees or other settlement agreements or by participating in ongoing settlement discussions or site studies and  in accordance therewith  the prp group is generally performing or has agreed to perform the site remediation program with government oversight 
of the six remaining active sites at which one or more of the sellers has been designated as a prp  the sellers are contesting liability at three sites 
table of contents and plan to participate as settling prps at three sites 
for the sites  the company accrued  at december  the company is contesting its liability on behalf of the sellers at three sites 
the company recorded no accrual related to these three sites 
in addition  the company estimates that the discounted reasonably possible additional losses for the sites totals  inactive third party superfund sites 
in addition to the active superfund sites owned by third parties  the sellers have also been identified as prps at several other federal or state superfund sites owned by third parties which the company believes are now inactive with respect to the sellers 
the inactive sites generally involve the shipment by the sellers of a de minimis amount of wastes to such sites and prior entrance by the sellers into consent decrees  settlement agreements or similar arrangements providing for minimal payment obligations 
de minimis agreements generally are intended to settle all claims for small prps and such agreements have limited re opener provisions 
at certain other inactive sites  the sellers have disclaimed any liability by advising the governmental entities involved that the sellers had not shipped any wastes to those sites 
except to the extent that minimal amounts remain to be paid under existing consent decrees  settlement agreements or similar arrangements  the company has not established financial reserves for any of the inactive sites because the company believes that the sellers cleanup liabilities with respect to those sites have already been resolved 
legal proceedings not related to csd assets in addition to the legal proceedings in which the company became involved as a result of its acquisition of the csd assets  the company is also involved in certain legal proceedings which have arisen for other reasons 
the principal such legal proceedings include superfund proceedings relating to sites owned by third parties where the company or a predecessor has been named a prp  an enforcement action brought by the new york state department of environmental conservation  and litigation involving the former holders of the company s subordinated notes 
superfund sites not related to csd acquisition 
the company has been named as a prp at sites that are not related to the csd acquisition 
fourteen of these sites involve two subsidiaries  which the company acquired from chemwaste  a former subsidiary of waste management  inc as part of that acquisition  chemwaste agreed to indemnify the company with respect to any liability of its braintree and natick subsidiaries for waste disposed of before the company acquired them 
accordingly  waste management is paying all costs of defending the company s braintree and natick subsidiaries in these cases  including legal fees and settlement costs 
the company s subsidiary  which owns the bristol  connecticut facility  is involved in one of the superfund sites 
as part of the acquisition of the bristol  connecticut and cincinnati  ohio facilities  the seller and its now parent company  cemex  sa  agreed to indemnify the company with respect to any liability for waste disposed of before the company acquired the facilities  which would include any liability arising from superfund sites 
six of the sites involve former subsidiaries of chemclear inc some of these sites have been settled  and the company believes its ultimate exposure with respect to the remaining such sites will not be significant 
the company accrued  related to these sites at december  mr 
frank  inc  which was acquired by the company in july  is involved in four of the superfund sites  as a transporter of waste generated by others prior to the company s purchase of mr 
frank  inc the company acquired mr 
frank  inc in exchange for  shares of the company s common stock  of which  shares were deposited into an escrow account to be held as security for the sellers agreement to indemnify the company against potential liabilities  including environmental liabilities arising from prior ownership and operation of mr 
frank  inc one of the sites relates to the acquisition of murphy s waste oil services  inc which the company acquired in the company has been identified as a prp at two of the other sites  but the company believes that it has no liability at those sites 

table of contents as of december  and  the company had accrued environmental costs of  for cleanup of a superfund site related to the acquisition of murphy s waste oil services  inc spring grove settlement 
during the fourth quarter of  the company entered into a civil settlement with the us justice department and the us environmental protection agency epa to resolve issues resulting from a fatal accident at the company s spring grove facility in cincinnati  ohio 
without a finding or admission of liability by the company  the company entered on march   into a consent decree providing that the company pay a  fine and amend its operating permit to include certain operating procedures already implemented by the company shortly after the accident 
the company paid the fine in the first quarter of on september   the us justice department filed a motion with the federal district court for the southern district of ohio petitioning the court to terminate the order because the company had completed all the obligations required of it by july  on september   the court issued an order terminating the consent decree 
on october   the state of ohio also notified the company that it had closed its investigation of the matter as well 
these final actions by the relevant federal and state agencies bring this matter to a close 
nysdec enforcement action 
on january   clean harbors environmental services  inc entered into an order of consent with the new york state department of environmental conservation nysdec to settle allegations of manifesting and disposal violations for waste shipments to a landfill in new york that originated at two of the company s hazardous waste treatment  storage and disposal facilities 
the alleged violations include failure to indicate the appropriate state hazardous waste codes on the manifests  failure to notify the disposal facility that the wastes shipped did not meet the applicable treatment standards  and landfill of large pcb capacitors that should have been incinerated 
many of these allegations resulted from the same circumstances that were the focus of a separate consent order and settlement agreement with the us epa dated september  the company self reported the inadvertent land disposal of the pcb capacitors once the error was discovered and the capacitors were exhumed and properly disposed of by incineration 
clean harbors has agreed to pay a civil penalty of  to settle this matter 
epa enforcement action 
on april   region vii of the us environmental protection agency usepa  in kansas city  kansas  served a complaint  compliance order and notice of opportunity for hearing cco on the clean harbors environmental services  inc incineration facility in kimball  nebraska 
the cco stems from an inspection of the kimball facility a year ago  between april  thereafter  the usepa issued a notice of violation nov for certain alleged violations of rcra 
the company responded to the nov by letter and contested the allegations 
the epa alleges  among other things  that the facility had open containers of incinerator ash in the ash stabilization building  stored incompatible wastes without adequate separation  and failed to label equipment in hazardous waste service 
the cco seeks to impose a penalty in the amount of  the company continues to contest the allegations  believes it has meritorious defenses  intends to vigorously defend itself against the allegations and file a request for a hearing on the matter 
the company may also request an informal conference to further discuss the facts of the case in an attempt to arrive at settlement without incurring the expense and uncertainty of litigation 
since this action was filed just prior to the filing of this form k  the company has not had an opportunity to discuss settlement options with the usepa 
accordingly  no assurances can be given that the company will be able to settle the cco for an amount less than the demand 
litigation involving former holders of subordinated notes 
on april   the company issued to john hancock life insurance company  special value bond fund  llc  the bill and melinda gates foundation  and certain other institutional lenders collectively  the lenders  of senior subordinated notes due the subordinated notes as part of the company s refinancing of all its then outstanding indebtedness 
under the securities purchase agreement dated as of april   between the company and the lenders the purchase agreement  the company was also required to pay a  closing fee and issue to the lenders warrants for an aggregate of  shares of the company s common stock the warrants exercisable at any time prior to april  at an exercise price of 
per share 
the purchase agreement contained covenants limiting with certain exceptions the company s ability to acquire other businesses or incur 
table of contents additional indebtedness without the consent of a majority in interest of the lenders 
the purchase agreement also provided that  if the company should elect to prepay the subordinated notes prior to maturity  the company would be obligated to pay a prepayment penalty which  in the case of a prepayment prior to april   would include a so called make whole amount computed using a discount rate above the then current yield on united states government securities of equal maturity to the notes 
the purchase agreement also provided that  if the company should default on any of the terms of the purchase agreement including the covenants described above  the lenders would have the right to call the subordinated notes for payment at an amount equal to the principal  accrued interest and the so called make whole amount then in effect 
during several months prior to the company s acquisition of the csd assets on september   the company sought the lenders cooperation with respect to such acquisition and to include the lenders in a refinancing of the company s outstanding debt which might involve leaving the subordinated notes outstanding or refinancing them 
the lenders  however  refused to provide any such cooperation 
the company thus notified the lenders that it was proceeding with the acquisition of the csd assets  which would be a violation of certain covenants in the purchase agreement  and the lenders then called the subordinated notes for payment  including principal  interest and the make whole amount of  an amount equal to of the principal amount of the subordinated notes 
in response to the lenders demand  the company immediately paid in full the amount demanded  while notifying the lenders that it was paying the make whole amount under protest 
it is the company s position that if the payment to the lenders is not deemed to be voluntary and the make whole amount is deemed unconscionable  the make whole amount is likely to be held unenforceable under massachusetts case law 
shortly after the closing of the acquisition of the csd assets  the company wrote to the lenders demanding a return of the prepayment penalty  in response to which  on september   the lenders filed a complaint in the norfolk superior court john hancock life insurance company  et al 
v 
clean harbors  inc  asking the court to determine the prepayment penalty to be valid and enforceable 
on october   the company filed a complaint in the business litigation session of the suffolk superior court clean harbors  inc v 
john hancock life insurance company  et al  seeking a declaratory judgment that the make whole amount is an unenforceable penalty and seeking an order for the return of the amount paid as a penalty  less the lenders actual damages if any  plus interest and costs 
in the case of certain of the lenders  the company also seeks a judgment that those lenders receipt of their share of the make whole amount  the closing payment and the fair value of the warrants constitutes a violation of applicable massachusetts usury laws 
the company filed a motion seeking to consolidate both legal proceedings in the business litigation session of the suffolk superior court  which motion was recently granted
