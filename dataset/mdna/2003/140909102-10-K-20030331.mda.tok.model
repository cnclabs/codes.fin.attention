item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are a major manufacturer of recycled paperboard and converted paperboard products 
we operate in three business segments 
the paperboard segment manufactures recycled uncoated and clay coated paperboard and collects recycled paper and brokers recycled paper and other paper rolls 
the tube  core and composite container segment produces spiral and convolute wound tubes  cores and cans 
the carton and custom packaging segment produces printed and unprinted folding carton and set up boxes and provides contract manufacturing and packaging services 
our business is vertically integrated to a large extent 
this means that our converting operations consume a large portion of our own paperboard production  approximately in the remaining of our paperboard production is sold to external customers in any of the four recycled paperboard end use markets tube  core and composite containers  folding cartons  gypsum wallboard facing paper and other specialty products 
as part of our strategy to optimize our operating efficiency  each of our mills can produce recycled paperboard for more than one end use market 
this allows us to shift production between mills in response to customer or market demands 
recovered fiber  which is derived from recycled paper stock  is our most significant raw material 
historically  the cost of recovered fiber has fluctuated significantly due to market and industry conditions 
for example  our average recovered fiber cost per 
table of contents ton of paperboard produced increased from per ton in to per ton in  an increase of  before dropping to per ton in same mill recovered fiber cost per ton averaged and during and  respectively 
we raise our selling prices in response to increases in raw material costs 
however  we often are unable to pass the full amount of these costs through to our customers on a timely basis  and as a result often cannot maintain our operating margins in the face of dramatic cost increases 
we experience margin shrinkage during all periods of price increases due to customary time lags in implementing our price increases 
we cannot give assurance that we will be able to recover any future increases in the cost of recovered fiber by raising the prices of our products 
even if we are able to recover future cost increases  our operating margins and results of operations may still be materially and adversely affected by time delays in the implementation of price increases 
see part i  item  risk factors our business and financial performance may be harmed by future increases in raw material costs 
excluding labor  energy is our most significant manufacturing cost 
energy consists of electrical purchases and fuel used to generate steam used in the paper making process and to operate our paperboard machines and all of our other converting machinery 
our energy costs increased steadily throughout and the first quarter of before showing some improvement by the end of in  the average energy cost in our mill system was approximately per ton compared to per ton in  a increase 
in energy costs averaged per ton  a decline of from the increase in and was due primarily to increases in natural gas and fuel oil costs 
we expect that prices may continue to rise in response to armed conflict in the middle east and the uncertainties regarding the outcome and implications of such a conflict 
until the last few years  our business had not been significantly affected by energy costs  and we historically have not passed increases in energy costs through to our customers 
consequently  we were not able to pass through to our customers all of the energy cost increases we incurred in and as a result  our operating margins were adversely affected 
although we continue to evaluate our energy costs and consider ways to factor energy costs into our pricing we cannot give assurance that our operating margins and results of operations will not continue to be adversely affected by rising energy costs 
see part i  item  risk factors our operating margins may be adversely affected by rising energy costs 
historically  we have grown our business  revenues and production capacity to a significant degree through acquisitions 
based on the difficult operating climate for our industry and our financial position over the last two years  the pace of our acquisition activity  and accordingly  our revenue growth  has slowed as we have focused on conserving cash and maximizing the productivity of our existing facilities 
however  during  we purchased our joint venture partner s interest in our design tubes company limited canadian joint venture and acquired certain operating assets excluding accounts receivable of smurfit stone s industrial packaging group  see liquidity and capital resources acquisitions 
we are a holding company that currently operates our business through subsidiaries 
we also own a interest in two joint ventures with temple inland  inc we have an additional joint venture with an unrelated entity in which our investment and share of earnings are immaterial 
we account for these interests in our joint ventures under the equity method of accounting 
see liquidity and capital resources below 
critical accounting policies our accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require management to make estimates that affect the amounts of revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities reported 
the following are critical accounting matters which are both very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and which require some of management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
the accounting for these matters involves the making of estimates based on current facts  circumstances and assumptions which  in management s judgment  could change in a manner that would materially affect management s future estimates with respect to such matters and  accordingly  could cause future reported financial condition and results to differ materially from financial results reported based on management s current estimates 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue and the related account receivable when the following four criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the selling price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria is based on management s judgments regarding the collectibility of our accounts receivable 
generally  we recognize revenue when we ship our manufactured products or when we complete a service and title and risk of loss passes to our customers 
provisions for discounts  returns  allowances  customer rebates and other adjustments are provided for in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 

table of contents accounts receivable 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
these estimates may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have overstated or understated the reserve required for uncollectible accounts receivable 
inventory 
inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market 
cost includes materials  labor and overhead 
market  with respect to all inventories  is replacement cost or net realizable value 
management frequently reviews inventory to determine the necessity of write offs for excess  obsolete or unsaleable inventory 
these reviews require management to assess customer and market demand 
these estimates may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have overstated or understated the reserve required for excess  obsolete or unsaleable inventory 
goodwill 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this pronouncement requires us to perform a goodwill impairment test at least annually 
see the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our goodwill accounting 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on legal factors  market conditions and operational performance of our acquired businesses 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill associated with our acquired businesses is impaired 
evaluating the impairment of goodwill also requires us to estimate future operating results and cash flows  which also require judgment by management 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
impairment of long lived assets 
pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we periodically evaluate long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment and definite lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in conditions may indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors that management considers important that could initiate an impairment review include the following significant operating losses  significant declines in demand for a product whereby an asset is only able to produce that product  assets that are idled  assets that are likely to be divested the impairment review requires management to estimate future undiscounted cash flows associated with an asset or group of assets and sum the estimated future cash flows 
if the future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset  then we must estimate the fair value of the asset 
if the fair value of the asset exceeds the carrying value then the difference will be written off 
estimating future cash flows requires management to make judgments regarding future economic conditions  product demand and pricing 
although we believe our estimates are appropriate  significant differences in the actual performance of the asset or group of assets may materially affect our asset values and results of operations 
self insurance 
we are self insured for the majority of our workers compensation costs and health care costs  subject to specific retention levels 
consulting actuaries and administrators assist us in determining our liability for self insured claims 
our self insured workers compensation liability is estimated based on actual claims that are established by a third party administrator 
the actual claims are then increased by factors that reflect our historical claim development 
the developed claim is the liability that we record in our financial statements 
our self insured health care liability is estimated based on our actual claim experience and multiplied by a lag factor 
the lag factor represents claims that have been incurred and should be recorded as a liability  but have not been reported 
while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our workers compensation costs and group health insurance costs 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure  together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we 
table of contents must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
we record valuation allowances due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain state net operating losses carried forward and state tax credits  before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could have a material negative impact on our statement of operations and our balance sheet 
pension and other postretirement benefits 
we maintain a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan the pension plan 
the pension plan provides benefits to be paid to all eligible employees at retirement based primarily on years of service with the company and compensation rates in effect near retirement 
our policy is to fund benefits attributed to employees services to date as well as service expected to be earned in the future 
contributions were approximately million  million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
during we can make contributions to the pension plan between and approximately million 
we currently plan to make the maximum deductible contribution of million 
during  we adopted a supplemental executive retirement plan serp  which provides benefits to participants based on average compensation 
the serp covers certain executives of the company commencing upon retirement 
the serp was unfunded at december  our net pension expense for the pension plan and the serp was approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
net pension expense for is expected to be approximately million 
in addition  we recorded an additional minimum pension liability of approximately million in related to the pension plan representing the excess of unfunded accumulated benefit obligations over previously recorded pension liabilities 
the additional minimum pension liability was offset by an intangible asset of approximately million related to unrecognized prior service cost 
the remaining minimum pension liability of approximately million was recorded as a component of other comprehensive loss  net of the tax benefit 
the determination of our pension expense and benefit obligation is dependent on our selection of certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
those assumptions include  among others  the weighted average discount rate  the weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets and the weighted average rate of compensation increase 
following is a summary of the significant assumptions used to determine net periodic pension expense and the projected benefit obligation december  weighted average discount rate weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets weighted average rate of compensation increase in developing our weighted average discount rate  we evaluated input from our actuaries  including reviewing the rating and maturity of long term bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency 
the discount rate determined on the basis was lowered from at december  to at december  a 
change in the discount rate would result in a change in the additional minimum pension liability of approximately million 
based on our analysis of the rating and maturity of the long term bonds and the input from our actuaries  we believe that a discount rate of is reasonable 
future actual pension expense and benefit obligation will depend on future investment performance  changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to populations participating in our pension plans 
in developing our expected long term rate of return  we evaluated such criteria as return expectation by asset class and long term inflation assumptions 
our expected long term rate of return is based on an asset allocation assumption of equity and fixed income 
we regularly review our asset allocation and periodically rebalance our investments to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate 
as a result of our analysis  we lowered the expected rate of return from at december  to at december  the actual value of the pension plan assets decreased from approximately million to approximately million as a result of the recent market downturn  however  we continue to believe that is a reasonable long term rate of return 
we will continue to evaluate our actuarial assumptions  including our expected rate of return  at least annually  and will adjust as necessary 
the investment performance returns and declining discount rates increased our unfunded status of the pension plan and the serp plan by approximately million in while we believe that the assumptions we have used are appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension plan and serp liability 
we also provide postretirement medical benefits at certain of our subsidiaries 
our net periodic postretirement benefit cost for medical costs was approximately thousand  thousand and thousand for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the accumulated postretirement benefit obligations at december  and were determined using a weighted average discount rate of and  respectively 
the rate of increase in the costs of covered health care benefits is assumed to be in  decreasing each year to by the year increasing the assumed health care costs trend rate by one percentage point would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december  by approximately thousand and would increase net periodic postretirement benefit cost by approximately thousand for the year ended december  depreciation 
management is required to make estimates regarding useful lives and salvage values of long lived assets 
these estimates can significantly impact depreciation expense and accordingly  both results of operations and the asset values reflected on the balance sheet 
during the fourth quarter of  we engaged independent professional valuation advisors to assist management in evaluating the appropriate remaining estimated useful lives for the acquired smurfit industrial packaging group machinery and equipment and for our existing machinery and equipment 
management initiated this review based on industry practice  our actual experience and the lives assigned by the former owner of the acquired smurfit assets 
this review resulted in a change in the average estimated useful lives of machinery and equipment from approximately years to approximately years 
the change in estimate lowered depreciation expense in the fourth quarter of approximately million 
results of operations the following table shows volume  gross paper margins and related data for the periods indicated 
the volume information shown below includes shipments of unconverted paperboard and converted paperboard products

our consolidated sales for the year ended december  increased to million from million in acquisitions completed during accounted for million of sales during these acquisitions included certain assets of the smurfit industrial packaging group  a business unit of jefferson smurfit corporation us and design tubes co  ltd 
the results of operations for these acquisitions were included only from and after the date of the acquisition 
excluding acquisitions completed during  sales were essentially unchanged from although total sales were unchanged  sales increased in the paperboard segment during  but were offset by a decline in sales in the carton and custom packaging segment 
sales in the paperboard segment increased due to higher sales of unconverted coated paperboard to external customers partially offset by a decline in selling prices 
the decline in sales in the carton and custom packaging segment was due to a significant decrease in selling prices resulting from intense competitive pressures  partially offset by an increase in volume 
total paperboard tonnage for increased to  thousand tons from  thousand tons in excluding acquisitions completed during  total paperboard tonnage increased to  thousand tons 
this increase was primarily due to higher internal conversion by our operations in the carton and custom packaging and the tube  core and composite container segments and higher shipments of unconverted paperboard to external customers in the folding carton  tube  core and composite container and other specialty markets 
these improvements were partially offset by a decrease in gypsum wallboard facing paper volume 
however  including gypsum facing paper volume transferred to our owned  unconsolidated premier boxboard joint venture  gypsum facing paper volume was essentially unchanged compared to prior year 
excluding acquisitions  outside purchases increased to thousand tons due primarily to higher purchases by our carton and custom packaging segment

this margin decrease was due primarily to lower margins in the paperboard segment  partially offset by improved margins in the tube  core and composite container segment 

table of contents margins in the paperboard segment decreased due to a decline in selling prices and an increase in recovered fiber costs 
margins in the tube  core  and composite container segment improved due to higher selling prices and slightly lower paperboard costs

selling  general and administrative expenses were million in  an increase of from excluding the impact of acquisitions from and excluding goodwill amortization from  selling  general and administrative expenses were million or of sales for  compared to million or of sales in the decline in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales was the result of closing facilities and cost cutting efforts throughout all of our business segments 
these reductions were partially offset by higher corporate expenses related to amendment fees for our senior credit facility  executive recruiting and severance costs  costs related to a proposed debt issuance that was aborted and noncapitalized costs related to acquisitions 
restructuring and other costs 
in june  we recorded a thousand noncash  pretax restructuring charge related to the permanent closure of our camden and chicago paperboard mills  which were shut down in and  respectively 
the thousand charge represents a revised estimate of fixed asset disposals at these mills 
in december  we initiated a plan to restructure our carton plant in ashland  ohio to serve a smaller  more focused carton market and recorded a pretax charge to operations of approximately million 
the million charge included a million noncash write down of assets 
in december  we initiated a plan to permanently close our halifax paperboard mill located in roanoke rapids  north carolina and recorded a pretax charge to operations of approximately million 
the million charge included a million noncash write down of assets 
in december  we initiated a plan to consolidate our converting operations in fayetteville  north carolina into carolina component concepts  also located in north carolina  and recorded a pretax charge to operations of approximately million

in january  we initiated a plan to close our paperboard mill located in chicago  illinois and recorded a pretax charge to operations of approximately million 
the million charge included a million noncash write down of assets 
in march  we initiated a plan to consolidate the operations of our salt lake city  utah carton plant into our denver  colorado carton plant and recorded a pretax charge to operations of approximately million 
the million charge included a million noncash write down of assets 
see the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our restructuring plans 
operating income 
operating income for was million  a decrease of million  or from the decrease in operating income was the result of the following higher recovered fiber costs and lower selling prices in the paperboard segment 
lower selling prices in the carton and custom packaging segment 
higher restructuring costs in compared with the results included a million accrual reversal related to expiring unfavorable supply contracts at the sprague paper mill 
higher corporate expenses as described above 
the items listed above explaining the decrease in operating income were partially offset by the following the million net impact of the change in estimated useful lives of machinery and equipment 
the results include goodwill amortization expense of million which was not recognized in 
table of contents the results include operating income of million from the smurfit industrial packaging group acquisition 
other income expense 
interest expense decreased to million for from million in this decrease was due to savings from interest rate swap agreements that effectively converted portions of our fixed rate notes into variable rate obligations 
see liquidity and capital resources for additional information regarding our debt  interest expense and interest rate swap agreements 
equity in income from unconsolidated affiliates was million in  an improvement of million from equity in loss from unconsolidated affiliates of million in this increase was primarily due to improved operating results for standard gypsum  lp  our gypsum wallboard joint venture with temple inland 
the improved results were due primarily to higher selling prices in compared to standard gypsum s improved results were partially offset by increased losses at premier boxboard limited  our paper mill joint venture with temple inland 
the increased losses at premier boxboard were due to lower selling prices and higher recovered fiber costs 
net loss 
net loss for was million versus a loss of million in the increase in net loss was the result of the following lower operating income in compared to as explained above 
partially offset by lower interest expense due to benefits derived from interest rate swaps 
higher interest income due to higher cash balances 
a gain of thousand on extinguishment of debt in compared with a million loss in a million improvement in results from our unconsolidated joint ventures  primarily due to higher selling prices at our standard gypsum joint venture

these acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  and their results of operations were included only from and after the date of the acquisition 
excluding acquisitions completed during  sales decreased during this decrease was due to lower selling prices and volume from the paperboard and the tube  core and composite container segments  along with lower selling prices from the carton and custom packaging segment due to competitive pressures 
the decline in volume from the tube  core and composite container segment was primarily attributable to the downturn in the textile industry 
total paperboard tonnage for decreased to  thousand tons from  thousand tons in excluding acquisitions completed during  total paperboard tonnage declined to thousand tons 
this decrease was primarily due to lower shipments of unconverted paperboard to external customers combined with lower internal conversion by our converting operations in the other specialty products and the tube  core and composite container markets 
the decrease in shipments of unconverted paperboard was due primarily to a decline in industry demand and partially attributable to the dispute with georgia pacific

margins decreased in the carton and custom packaging segment due to lower selling prices resulting from competitive pressures 
margins in the tube  core and composite container segment decreased as a result of lower selling prices  higher paperboard costs and a decline in the textile industry 
the improved margins in the paperboard segment were the result of cost cutting efforts to reduce expenses combined with the substantial decline in fiber costs  which were partially offset by the decline in selling prices and the increase in energy costs

operating income 
operating income for was million  a decrease of million  or from operating income excluding the sprague reserve reduction  restructuring charges and acquisitions was million for  a decrease of million  or  from operating income of million in  excluding restructuring charges and other costs 
this decline was due primarily to lower volume in the tube  core and composite container and paperboard segments  partially attributable to the dispute with georgia pacific  and lower margins in the carton and custom packaging and tube  core and composite container segments 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  in compared to  but decreased million  or  excluding acquisitions 
this decrease was primarily due to mill closures in the paperboard segment 
other income expense 
interest expense increased to million for from million in this increase was due to higher outstanding debt balances at higher interest rates  partially offset by savings from interest rate swap agreements which effectively converted portions of our fixed rate notes into variable rate obligations 
see liquidity and capital resources for additional information regarding our debt  interest expense and interest rate swap agreements 
equity in loss from unconsolidated affiliates was million in  down million from equity in income from unconsolidated affiliates of million in this decrease was primarily due to lower operating results for standard gypsum  lp  our gypsum wallboard joint venture with temple inland 
the lower results were due primarily to significantly lower selling prices in compared to due to excess capacity in that market 
net income loss 
as discussed above  our results for included restructuring charges recorded in conjunction with the closing of our chicago  illinois paperboard mill and the consolidation of operations of our salt lake city  utah carton plant into our denver  colorado carton plant

also included in the results for was a loss of million related to the extinguishment of debt million  net of tax benefit  or per common share on a diluted basis 
partially offsetting these charges was the million reduction in reserves related to expiring unfavorable supply contracts at the sprague paperboard mill million  net of tax provision  or per common share on a diluted basis 
net loss was million in  or net loss per common share on a diluted basis  compared with net income of million  or net income per common share on a diluted basis  in liquidity and capital resources liquidity sources and risks 
our primary sources of liquidity are cash from operations and borrowings under the various debt facilities described below 
downturns in operations can significantly affect our ability to generate cash 
for example  in the difficult operating climate we experienced in  we generated million less cash from operations than we did in factors that can affect our operating results and liquidity are discussed further in this report under risk factors in part i  item in  we generated million in cash from operations  which is million higher than despite the continuing difficult operating climate 
although the timing or certainty cannot be assured  we believe that our existing cash and liquidity position will be strengthened through the sale of the real estate at our chicago  illinois and baltimore  maryland paperboard mills 
additionally  we expect to receive a federal tax refund of approximately million in the first half of although we believe that our liquidity will be sufficient to meet expected needs for the foreseeable future  we could require additional funds from external sources 
however  our availability for borrowings under our senior credit facility has been substantially reduced in connection with a sixth amendment to the facility completed on march   as described under subsequent events 
we intend to replace or refinance our existing senior credit facility during the second quarter of however  we can give no assurance that we will be able to replace this credit facility at all or on terms that are acceptable to us 
in the event we are unable to do so  we can give no assurance that we will have sufficient liquidity to meet our cash needs should we face an unexpected downturn in operations 
on september   we acquired certain operating assets excluding accounts receivable of the smurfit industrial packaging group for a purchase price of million  and the assumption of million of indebtedness outstanding under certain industrial 
table of contents development revenue bonds 
see acquisitions 
in addition  because we did not purchase trade accounts receivable as part of the acquisition  we contributed working capital of approximately million during the fourth quarter of we funded the acquisition with cash on hand 
the availability of liquidity from borrowings is primarily affected by our continued compliance with the terms of the debt agreements governing these facilities  including the payment of interest and compliance with various covenants and financial maintenance tests 
in addition  as described below under off balance sheet arrangements joint venture financings and subsequent events  to the extent we are unable to comply with financial maintenance tests under our senior credit facility  we will fail to comply with identical financial maintenance covenant tests under our guarantee of the credit facilities of one of our joint ventures  which could potentially materially and adversely affect us through a series of cross defaults under both our joint ventures and our own debt obligations if we were unable to obtain appropriate waivers or amendments with respect to the underlying violations and any related cross defaults 
at december   we were not in compliance with certain financial maintenance covenants under both our senior credit facility and our joint venture guarantees  but we were able to obtain appropriate amendments or waivers with respect to each instance of non compliance 
similarly  at december  we would not have been in compliance with our senior credit facility and our joint venture guarantees but again were able to obtain the appropriate amendments 
absent further material deterioration of the us economy as a whole or the specific sectors on which our business depends see part i  item  risk factors our business and financial performance may be adversely affected by downturns in industrial production  housing and construction and the consumption of durable and nondurable goods  we believe it is unlikely that we will breach our covenants under our debt agreements or joint venture credit support arrangements during  after taking into account the amendments discussed below in subsequent events 
however  we cannot give assurance that we will achieve our expected future operating results or continued compliance with our debt covenants  or that  in such event  necessary waivers and amendments from our lenders would be available at all or on acceptable terms 
if our debt or that of our joint ventures were placed in default  or if we were called upon to satisfy our joint venture support obligations  our liquidity and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected 
borrowings 
at december  and  total debt consisting of current maturities of debt  senior credit facility  and other long term debt  as reported on our consolidated balance sheets was as follows in thousands senior credit facility senior subordinated notes senior notes senior notes other notes payable total debt on march   we completed a series of financing transactions pursuant to which we i issued million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes due may  and million in aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes due april   ii used the proceeds from these notes to repay in full our former senior credit facility and senior notes  and iii obtained a new million senior credit facility 
the senior notes and senior subordinated notes were issued at a discount to yield effective interest rates of and  respectively 
aggregate proceeds from the sale of these notes  net of issuance costs  was approximately million 
in connection with the repayment of the senior notes  we incurred a prepayment penalty of approximately million 
we recorded a loss of million which included the prepayment penalty plus unamortized issuance costs of thousand 
the difference between issue price and principal amount at maturity of our senior notes and senior subordinated notes will be accreted each year as interest expense in our consolidated financial statements 
these publicly traded notes are unsecured  but are guaranteed  on a joint and several basis  by all of our domestic subsidiaries subsidiary guarantors  other than one that is not wholly owned 
our senior credit facility provides for a revolving line of credit  the aggregate principal amount of which was reduced from million to million pursuant to the sixth amendment completed on march  and described under subsequent events 
the facility includes subfacilities of million for swingline loans and million for letters of credit  usage of which reduces availability under the facility 
pursuant to the sixth amendment described under subsequent events  the sub facility for letters of credit was increased from million to million and the maturity date of the facility was shortened from march  to april  as of december   no borrowings were outstanding under the facility  and an aggregate of million in letter of credit obligations were outstanding 
no borrowings were outstanding under the facility as of december  we intend to use the remaining balance of the facility for working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes  if necessary 
as described below  a fourth amendment to the facility was completed in which we were required  upon the closing of our acquisition of the smurfit industrial packaging group  to enter into a security agreement under which we and 
table of contents our subsidiary guarantors under the senior credit facility granted a first priority security interest in our respective accounts receivable and inventory to secure our obligations under the credit facility and our obligations under our credit support of the credit facilities of standard gypsum and premier boxboard 
in connection with the sixth amendment described under subsequent events  we amended the security agreement to provide for a springing lien on our machinery and equipment effective on july  borrowings under the facility bear interest at a rate equal to our option  either the base rate which is equal to the greater of the prime rate most recently announced by bank of america  na  the administrative agent under the facility  or the federal funds rate plus one half of or the adjusted eurodollar interbank offered rate  in each case plus an applicable margin determined by reference to our leverage ratio which is defined under the facility as the ratio of our total debt to our total capitalization 
based on our leverage ratio at december   the current margins are for eurodollar rate loans and for base rate loans 
additionally  the undrawn portion of the facility is subject to a facility fee at an annual rate that is currently set at based on our leverage ratio at december  the facility contains covenants that restrict  among other things  our ability and our subsidiaries ability to create liens  merge or consolidate  dispose of assets  incur indebtedness and guarantees  pay dividends  repurchase or redeem capital stock and indebtedness  make certain investments or acquisitions  enter into certain transactions with affiliates  make capital expenditures or change the nature of our business 
the facility also contains several financial maintenance covenants  including covenants establishing a maximum leverage ratio  minimum tangible net worth and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
the facility contains events of default including  but not limited to  nonpayment of principal or interest  violation of covenants  incorrectness of representations and warranties  cross default to other indebtedness  bankruptcy and other insolvency events  material judgments  certain erisa events  actual or asserted invalidity of loan documentation and certain changes of control of our company 
during and  we completed five amendments to our senior credit facility agreement 
the first amendment  dated september   allows us to acquire up to million of our senior subordinated notes so long as no default or event of default exists on the date of the transaction or will result from the transaction 
the second amendment  dated november   provides for the issuance of letters of credit under the senior credit facility having an original expiration date more than one year from the date of issuance  if required under related industrial revenue bond documents and agreed to by the issuing lender 
the third amendment was completed on january   with an effective date of september  we obtained this amendment in order to avoid the occurrence of an event of default under our senior credit facility agreement resulting from a violation of the interest coverage ratio covenant contained in the agreement 
this amendment modified the definitions of interest expense  premier boxboard interest expense and standard gypsum interest expense to include interest income and the benefit or expense derived from interest rate swap agreements or other interest hedge agreements 
additionally  the amendment lowered the minimum allowable interest coverage ratio for the fourth quarter of from to  for the first quarter of from to  and for the second quarter of from to in connection with the acquisition of the smurfit industrial packaging group  we entered into a fourth amendment to our senior credit facility in september the purpose of this amendment was to obtain the required lender consent under the senior credit facility for the consummation of the acquisition and the incurrence of up to million in subordinated debt financing to refinance borrowings under the credit facility and restore cash used to fund a portion of the acquisition price  to lower the minimum allowable tangible net worth for all periods after the effective date of the amendment  and to increase the maximum permitted leverage ratio covenant to for the fiscal quarters ending december   march  and june   and for the fiscal quarter ending september  additionally  the minimum interest coverage ratio covenant was replaced with a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio covenant beginning with the third quarter of these modifications  in addition to increasing our flexibility to finance the acquisition  were necessary to enable us to avoid violations of the leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio covenants for the third quarter of and violations of the leverage ratio covenant in future periods 
in exchange for these modifications  our lenders required an increase in the applicable margin component of the interest rates applicable to borrowings under the facility and the facility fee rate applicable to the undrawn portion of the facility 
the amendment also provided for a pricing increase of effective november   if we did not issue at least million in senior subordinated notes by that date  which we did not  and an increase of every three months after that date until the first date on which our balance of cash and cash equivalents is at least million and we have no loans outstanding under the facility subject to a maximum interest margin of for eurodollar rate loans and for base rate loans 
in addition  under the terms of the fourth amendment  we were required to enter into a security agreement under which we and our subsidiary guarantors under the senior 
table of contents credit facility granted a first priority security interest in our respective accounts receivable and inventory to secure our obligations under the credit facility and our obligations under our credit support of the credit facilities of standard gypsum and premier boxboard 
on december   we completed a fifth amendment to our senior credit facility 
for the term of the agreement  this amendment modifies the calculation of net worth for purposes of our leverage ratio and tangible net worth financial maintenance covenants to exclude adjustments to other comprehensive loss related to our defined benefit pension plan 
this amendment also allows us to exclude from these financial maintenance covenant calculations any restructuring costs recorded in the fourth quarter of and first quarter of as long as the aggregate of these restructuring costs does not exceed million  on an after tax basis 
on june   we issued million in aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due june  our senior notes were issued at a discount to yield an effective interest rate of  are unsecured obligations of our company and pay interest semiannually 
in connection with the offering of our senior notes and senior subordinated notes  our subsidiary guarantors also guaranteed our senior notes 
in february  we purchased million in principal amount of our senior notes in the open market 
this purchase will lower our interest expense by approximately thousand annually 
we have certain obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts  such as debt and lease agreements 
see the notes to the consolidated financial statements  which detail these future obligations and commitments 
interest rate swaps 
during  we entered into four interest rate swap agreements in notional amounts totaling million 
the agreements  which have payment and expiration dates that correspond to the terms of the note obligations they cover  effectively converted million of our fixed rate senior subordinated notes and million of our fixed rate senior notes into variable rate obligations 
the variable rates are based on the three month libor plus a fixed margin 
these swap agreements decreased interest expense by million and million in and  respectively 
we expect our swap agreements to continue to lower our interest expense  however  if the three month libor increases significantly  our interest expense could be adversely affected 
based on notional amounts hedged and the three month libor at december   our swaps would reduce our interest expense by approximately million in compared with million in  as mentioned above 
if the three month libor increased basis points  our savings on interest expense would be reduced by approximately million 
in october  we unwound our million interest rate swap agreement related to the senior subordinated notes and received million from the bank counter party 
simultaneously  we executed a new swap agreement with a fixed spread that was basis points higher than the original swap agreement 
the new swap agreement is the same notional amount  has the same terms and covers the same notes as the original agreement 
the million gain will be accreted to interest expense over the remaining term of the notes and will partially offset the increase in interest expense 
the million gain lowered the effective interest rate of the senior subordinated notes from to 
in august  we unwound our million interest rate swap agreement related to the senior subordinated notes and received million from the bank counter party 
simultaneously  we executed a new swap agreement with a fixed spread that was basis points higher than the original swap agreement 
the new swap agreement is the same notional amount  has the same terms and covers the same notes as the original agreement 
in september  we repaid the million and entered into a new swap agreement that lowered the fixed spread by basis points from the august swap 
in november  we unwound million of our million interest rate swap agreement related to the senior subordinated notes  and received approximately million from the bank counter party 
simultaneously  we unwound million of one of our interest rate swap agreements related to the senior notes  and received approximately million 
the million gain will be accreted to interest expense over the remaining term of the notes and will partially offset the increase in interest expense

off balance sheet arrangements joint venture financings 
as noted above  we own a interest in two joint ventures with temple inland  inc standard gypsum  lp and premier boxboard limited llc 
because we account for these interests in our joint ventures under the equity method of accounting  the indebtedness of these joint ventures is not reflected in the liabilities included on our consolidated balance sheets 
prior to march   we guaranteed of certain obligations of these joint ventures 
as described in the following paragraph and under subsequent events  on march  we entered into an amendment under which we replaced our guarantee agreement for the standard gypsum facility with a letter of credit issued under our senior credit facility 
the replaced guarantee agreement for standard gypsum contained independent financial maintenance covenants that were identical to the covenants under our senior credit facility  and we are no longer obligated to comply with those covenants for the benefit of the standard gypsum lenders 
however  our guarantee agreement for the premier boxboard credit facility remains in effect and contains the same independent financial maintenance covenants 
a default under this guarantee also constitutes a default under the credit facilities of these joint ventures and a default under our senior credit facility 
our default under one or more of these covenants would technically permit the lenders under the joint venture credit facilities and our joint venture partner s respective guarantees of those facilities  as well as the lenders under our senior credit facility  if they so elected  to prohibit any future borrowings under these facilities and to accelerate all such outstanding obligations under these facilities 
the resulting acceleration of our obligations could also cause further defaults and accelerations under our senior subordinated notes  our senior notes and our senior notes 
during  we entered into agreements with the premier boxboard limited and standard gypsum lenders that correspond to the amendments made in the third  fourth and fifth amendments to the senior credit facility  as described above 
at december   we and our joint venture partner were in compliance with all covenants under these guarantees 
however  to the extent that we are unable to comply with  or are required to seek waivers under  or modifications of  the financial maintenance covenants under our senior credit facility in order to avoid possible events of noncompliance  as described above  we will need similar waivers or modifications under the premier boxboard guarantee 
standard gypsum is the obligor under reimbursement agreements pursuant to which direct pay letters of credit in the aggregate original amount of approximately million have been issued for its account in support of industrial development bond obligations 
we are severally obligated for of standard gypsum s obligations for reimbursement of letter of credit drawings  interest  fees and other amounts 
the other standard gypsum partner  temple inland  has guaranteed of standard gypsum s obligations 
as of december   the outstanding letters of credit totaled approximately million  for one half of which we are obligated approximately million 
if either joint venture partner defaults under their respective support arrangements  our total obligation is million at december  as described above and under subsequent events  on march  we entered into an amendment of the standard gypsum facility under which we replaced our guarantee with a letter of credit issued under our senior credit facility 
this letter of credit is in the amount of million and expires on january  if we are unable to replace or refinance our existing senior credit facility or to obtain a replacement letter of credit from another financing source prior to such date  or if prior to such date there is an event of default under the standard gypsum facility  the lenders under the standard gypsum facility will be entitled to draw under this letter of credit to satisfy our support obligations 
premier boxboard is the borrower under a credit facility the aggregate principal amount of which was reduced from million to million pursuant to an amendment completed on march  and described under subsequent events 
pursuant to this amendment  the maturity date of the facility was shortened from june  to january  we have severally and unconditionally guaranteed of premier boxboard s obligations under the credit facility for principal including reimbursement of letter of credit drawings  interest  fees and other amounts 
temple inland has similarly guaranteed of premier boxboard s obligations 
as of december   the outstanding principal amount of borrowings under the facility was approximately million including a thousand undrawn letter of credit  one half of which we guarantee approximately million 
if either joint venture partner defaults under their respective guarantee agreements  our total obligation is million at december  in addition to the general default risks discussed above with respect to the joint ventures  a substantial portion of the assets of premier boxboard are pledged as security for million in outstanding principal amount of senior notes under which premier boxboard is the obligor 
these notes are guaranteed by temple inland  but are not guaranteed by us 
a default under the premier boxboard credit facility would also constitute an event of default under these notes 
in the event of default under these notes  the holders would also have recourse to the assets of premier boxboard that are pledged to secure these notes 
thus  any resulting default under these notes could result in the assets of premier boxboard being utilized to satisfy creditor claims  which would have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and operations of premier boxboard and  accordingly  our interest in premier boxboard 
further  in such an event of default  these assets would not be available to satisfy obligations owing to unsecured creditors of premier boxboard  including the lender under the credit facility  which might make it more likely that our guarantee of the premier boxboard credit facility would be the primary source of repayment under the facility in the event premier boxboard cannot pay 
additional contingencies relating to our joint ventures that could affect our liquidity include possible additional capital contributions and buy sell triggers which  under certain circumstances  give us and our joint venture partner either the right  or the obligation  to purchase the other s interest or to sell an interest to the other 
in the case of both standard gypsum and premier boxboard  neither joint venture partner is obligated or required to make additional capital contributions without the consent of the 
table of contents other 
with regard to buy sell rights  under the standard gypsum joint venture  in general  either party may purchase the other s interest upon the occurrence of certain purported unauthorized transfers or involuntary transfer events such as bankruptcy 
in addition  under the standard gypsum joint venture  either i in the event of an unresolved deadlock over a material matter or ii at any time  either party may initiate a russian roulette buyout procedure by which it names a price at which the other party must agree either to sell its interest to the initiating party or to purchase the initiating party s interest 
under the premier boxboard joint venture  in general  mutual buy sell rights are triggered upon the occurrence of certain purported unauthorized or involuntary transfers  but in the event of certain change of control or deadlock events  the buy sell rights are structured such that we are always the party entitled  or obligated  as the case may be  to purchase 
we generally consider our relationship with temple inland to be good with respect to both of our joint ventures and currently do not anticipate experiencing material liquidity events resulting from either additional capital contributions or buy sell contingencies with respect to our joint ventures during however  in light of the recent amendments to the premier boxboard credit facility  as described in subsequent events  we could be required to fund premier boxboard s operations with additional cash contributions to the extent it is unable to fund operations with internally generated cash 
we cannot give assurance that material liquidity events will not arise with respect to our joint ventures  and the occurrence of any such events could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition 
cash from operations 
cash generated from operations was million for the year ended december   compared with million in the increase in compared to the same period in was due primarily to an increase in distributions from our standard gypsum joint venture and an increase in federal tax refunds  partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable related to the acquisition of the smurfit industrial packaging group and lower net income 
capital expenditures 
capital expenditures were million in versus million in aggregate capital expenditures of approximately million are anticipated for to conserve cash  we intend to limit capital expenditures for to cost reduction  productivity improvement and replacement projects 
acquisitions 
in april  we acquired the remaining of the outstanding stock of design tubes company limited design tubes  toronto  ontario  canada in consideration for shares of a subsidiary exchangeable at the holder s option for no additional consideration for approximately thousand shares of our common stock  valued at million 
we originally acquired our minority interest in design tubes in november and accounted for our ownership using the equity method 
design tubes manufactures paperboard tubes and also produces paper tube manufacturing equipment for companies throughout north america 
goodwill in the amount of million was recorded in the connection with the design tubes acquisition 
on september   we acquired certain operating assets excluding accounts receivable of the smurfit industrial packaging group  a business unit of jefferson smurfit corporation us  for approximately million  and assumed million of indebtedness outstanding under certain industrial revenue bonds 
the acquisition was funded with cash on hand 
goodwill and intangible assets of approximately million were recorded in conjunction with the smurfit industrial packaging group acquisition 
smurfit industrial packaging group operations included paper tube and core plants  uncoated recycled paperboard mills and partition manufacturing plants 
these facilities are located in states across the us and in canada 
we believe that these assets enhance our capabilities in the tube  core and composite container market and position us as a prominent producer in this market 
also in september  we acquired a provider of digital imaging services for thousand shares of our common stock valued at approximately thousand 
dividends 
we paid cash dividends of thousand in versus million in during  we reduced our dividend payments from to per issued and outstanding common share 
then in february  we announced that we would suspend future dividend payments on our common stock until our earnings performance exceeds the dividend limitation provision of our senior subordinated notes 
we made these decisions to reduce the quarterly dividends to preserve our financial flexibility in light of difficult industry conditions and due to the limitations on dividend payments in our financial covenants 
we intend to continue assessing our ability to pay quarterly dividends in light of difficult industry conditions  our need to preserve financial flexibility and the limitations on dividends included in our financial covenants 
as described under subsequent events  our senior credit facility currently prohibits us from paying any dividends 
share purchases 
we did not purchase any shares of our common stock during  or under our common stock purchase plan 
we have cumulatively purchased million shares since january our board of directors has authorized purchases of up to thousand additional shares 
however  our senior subordinated notes and our senior credit facility currently preclude us from purchasing our common stock based on our operating results for the last twelve months 

table of contents inflation raw material price changes have had  and continue to have  a material negative effect on our operations 
energy prices had a material effect on our operations in and we do not believe that general economic inflation is a significant determinant of our raw material price increases or that  except as it relates to energy prices  it has a material effect on our operations 
subsequent events in january  we effectively unwound million of our million interest rate swap agreement related to the senior subordinated notes by assigning our rights and obligations under the swap to one of our lenders under the senior credit facility 
in exchange  we received approximately million 
we will accrete this gain into interest expense over the remaining term of the notes  which will partially offset the increase in interest expense 
the gain will lower the effective interest rate of the senior subordinated notes from to 
also in january  we completed the purchase of our venture partner s equity of caraustar northwest  llc  located in tacoma  wa  for approximately thousand 
the tacoma facility  which manufactures tubes  cores and edge protectors and performs custom slitting for customers on the west coast  will become a part of our industrial consumer products group 
in february  we announced the indefinite idling of one of two coated recycled paperboard machines at our rittman  ohio paperboard mill 
recently completed upgrades in our mill system will facilitate the transfer of production from the idled machine to our other mills 
the rittman workforce will be indefinitely reduced by hourly employees  and we will recognize a related expense of approximately million 
on march   we completed a sixth amendment to our senior credit facility 
this amendment increased our maximum permitted leverage ratio to for the fiscal quarters ending september  and december  and for each succeeding fiscal quarter  lowered our minimum fixed charge coverage ratio from for all fiscal quarters to for the fiscal quarter ending march   for the fiscal quarters ending june  and september  and for the fiscal quarter ending december   lowered our minimum tangible net worth covenant for all periods on and after the effective date of the amendment  and lowered our maximum permitted capital expenditures to million per fiscal year 
for purposes of calculating compliance with our leverage ratio and net worth covenants  this amendment also establishes a maximum of million for aggregate adjustments to other comprehensive loss related to our defined benefit pension plan 
this amendment also increases to million our subfacility for the issuance of letters of credit under the facility  in order to permit us to obtain a letter of credit to replace our standard gypsum joint venture guarantee as described below 
finally  this amendment terminated the quarterly pricing increase established under the fourth amendment to the facility entered into in september and fixed our maximum interest margins at for libor loans and for base rate loans 
the financial covenant modifications were necessary to enable us to avoid possible violations of our leverage ratio covenant for the third and fourth quarters of  our fixed charge coverage ratio covenant for all quarters during and our net worth covenant for the second quarter of in exchange for these modifications  our lenders required us to permanently reduce the aggregate commitments under the facility from million to million  to shorten the maturity of the facility from march  to april   and to pay a monthly fee beginning on july  equal to of the aggregate commitments under the facility 
our lenders also required the establishment of a borrowing base that restricts availability under the facility based on monthly computations of eligible accounts receivable and inventory  reduced by our net hedging obligations owed to lenders under the facility and by the amount of our guarantee obligations under our joint venture guarantees that are not secured or replaced by letters of credit 
additionally  we will not be permitted to borrow or request the issuance of letters of credit under the facility unless we have less than million in freely available cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheet both before and immediately after giving effect to the application of the proceeds of such borrowing 
the amendment also requires us to prepay outstanding loans under the facility and or cash collateralize outstanding letters of credit with the net cash proceeds from any issuance of debt or equity or  to the extent not reinvested in similar assets  from any sale of assets or insurance or condemnation award 
the amendment further requires us to provide consolidated financial statements and joint venture financial statements to the lenders on a monthly basis 
finally  the amendment prohibits us from incurring capital leases or other indebtedness  making acquisitions or other investments  or prepaying other indebtedness unless our fixed charge coverage ratio for the most recently reported fiscal quarter exceeds calculated on a pro forma basis with regard to acquisitions  and completely eliminates our ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares of our stock 

table of contents in connection with this amendment  we were also required to amend our security agreement to provide for a springing lien on our machinery and equipment that will become effective on july  we intend to refinance our senior credit facility with a new revolving credit facility  which we expect would be an asset based credit facility secured by substantially all of our assets 
we expect to complete this refinancing by the end of the second quarter of in connection with this refinancing  we also intend to refinance our joint venture credit facilities and our credit support of such facilities 
however  we cannot give assurance that we will be able to complete a new credit facility on terms that are acceptable to us  or that we will be able to refinance our joint venture credit facilities and related credit support as part of or in connection with any such new credit facility 
prior to this amendment to our senior credit facility  our standard gypsum joint venture guarantee contained financial maintenance covenants that were identical to those contained in our senior credit facility 
however  the lenders to standard gypsum were unwilling to agree to the modifications that we made under the amendment to the senior credit facility 
in order to avoid an event of default under that guarantee  we obtained a letter of credit under our senior credit facility in the face amount of million 
this letter of credit expires on january   is issued in favor of the standard gypsum lenders and replaces our guarantee obligations 
in exchange for this letter of credit  the standard gypsum lenders terminated our guarantee agreement and released their security interests in our accounts receivable and inventory 
we must also pay a fee on october  in the amount of of the undrawn amount of this letter of credit in the event the letter of credit remains outstanding on that date 
the letter of credit may be drawn in the event of a default under the standard gypsum credit facility 
in the event we are unable to replace or refinance our senior credit facility  or to obtain a replacement letter of credit from another financing source  the lenders under the standard gypsum facility will be entitled to draw under the letter of credit to satisfy our support obligations  and as a result we may be unable to reimburse our senior lenders for the amount of such drawing 
concurrently with the amendments to our senior credit facility and the issuance of the letter of credit to the standard gypsum lenders as described above  we entered into an amendment of our premier boxboard guarantee that made changes to the financial covenants corresponding to those made in the sixth amendment to our senior credit facility 
in exchange for this amendment  the premier boxboard lenders required that the maturity of the premier boxboard credit facility be shortened from june  to january  and that the aggregate commitments under the facility be reduced to equal the amount of outstanding loans and letters of credit of million 
any reductions of outstanding loans under the facility may not be reborrowed and will permanently reduce the commitments  thereby effectively requiring us to fund premier boxboard s operations from its internal cash flow and from any cash contributions that we and our joint venture partner are permitted to make 
in addition  we will be required to pay a fee to the premier boxboard lenders of  on july  and on the first day of each month thereafter until the facility is terminated and all outstandings under the facility are fully paid 
if we are not able fund premier boxboard s operations in this manner  its performance could be adversely affected 
further  if we are unable to refinance this facility prior to january   the entire facility would become immediately due and payable and we would be required to satisfy our guarantee of of the obligations under the facility 
any acceleration of the obligations under either or both of our joint venture facilities  or any failure to satisfy our support obligations of either joint venture when due  could also cause further defaults and acceleration under our senior subordinated notes  our senior notes and our senior notes
