item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion contains a number of forward looking statements  all of which are based on current expectations 
actual results may differ materially due to a number of factors  including those discussed in the sections entitled risk factors and information relating to forward looking statements and in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  selected consolidated operating data for the company as a percentage of net sales 
relationship to net sales fiscal year net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income interest expense other income  net earnings before income taxes income taxes net earnings sales by operating segment for fiscal  and were as follows increase in thousands decrease versus versus segment north american    international    tactica    operating income loss by operating segment for fiscal  and was as follows increase in thousands decrease versus versus segment north american    international   tactica    corporate other    includes items not allocated to the three operating segments 
results of operations consolidated sales and gross profit margins our net sales for the month period ended february  fiscal grew by  or percent  compared to the month period ended february  fiscal 
net sales increased in our north american and international operating segments  while our tactica segment s net sales decreased 
fiscal net sales improved percent or  versus the month period ended february  fiscal 
all three of our operating segments exceeded their prior year sales totals  with the tactica operating segment producing  of the fiscal sales increase 
the international operating segment was responsible for most of the remaining sales growth 
gross profit  as a percentage of sales decreased from percent in fiscal to percent in fiscal  primarily because of the mix of net sales among our operating segments 
our north american and international segments net sales increased during fiscal  both in absolute terms and as a percentage of consolidated net sales 
these segments generally achieve lower gross margins than tactica  but also incur lower selling  general  and administrative expenses  as a percentage of net sales  than tactica 
this change in sales mix contributed to the decrease in gross profit margins 
the north american and international segments both achieved improved gross margins during fiscal  offsetting  in part  the effect of the change in our sales mix 
our fiscal gross profit margins improved from to percent 
most of this increase was attributable to tactica s higher sales 
tactica s net revenues made up percent of our consolidated fiscal net sales  versus percent in fiscal  thus increasing the effect of its relatively high gross margins on consolidated gross margins 
north american segment gross margins also improved from fiscal to fiscal  primarily because of a favorable change in the mix of products sold and our ability to source product more efficiently 
selling  general  and administrative expense during fiscal  selling  general  and administrative expenses sg a  expressed as a percentage of sales  decreased from percent to percent 
three factors contributed significantly to this decrease 
first  we experienced a  reduction in sg a due to the discontinuance of goodwill amortization associated with the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
second  sg a dropped by  compared to fiscal  because of foreign exchange gains 
finally  our north american and international segments comprised larger portions of our business in fiscal than in fiscal as mentioned above  the north american and international segments generally incur lower sg a  as a percentage of sales  than our other segment  tactica 
the difference in sg a rates is largely due to the fact that tactica s business model requires it to spend higher percentages of its net sales on media advertising 
because the north american and international segments contributed larger percentages of our consolidated net sales in fiscal than in fiscal  the lower sg a  as a percentage of sales  that they incurred  had a greater weight in determining consolidated sg a as a percentage of net sales 
from fiscal to fiscal  sg a expressed as a percentage of net sales  increased from percent to percent 
because tactica grew significantly during fiscal  both in its sales volume and as a percentage of our consolidated business  all of its operating statistics  including sg a as a percentage of sales  became much more significant to our overall results 
this was the primary reason for higher sg a  as a percentage of sales  during fiscal although its sg a percentage was higher than the percentages incurred by the other segments  tactica s sg a declined as a percentage of its net sales from fiscal to fiscal the main reason for the decline was a drop in tactica s fixed expenses as a percentage of its increased sales 
the variable portion of tactica s sg a expense rose slightly as a percentage of its fiscal net sales  mainly because of higher advertising expense 
excluding tactica  our fiscal sg a as a percentage of sales was consistent with fiscal  as lower media advertising expenses largely offset slightly higher personnel  insurance  and inventory storage costs 
north american segment the north american segment sells hair care and other personal care and comfort appliances  hair brushes  combs  utility and decorative hair accessories  liquid hair care products  and liquid and powder skin care products in the us and canada 
the north american segment s main customers are mass merchandisers  drug chains  warehouse clubs  grocery stores  and beauty supply retailers and wholesalers 
net sales in the north american segment grew  or percent from fiscal to fiscal on october   we expanded our product lines into the liquid and powder hair and skin care category by acquiring four brand names and licenses to sell products under two additional brand names 
sales of liquid and powder hair and skin care products under the six new brand names resulted in  of sales growth in the north american segment 
exclusive of these sales our north american segment grew percent 
the growth  exclusive of the liquid and powder product lines  resulted from increased sales of existing product lines that have been enhanced with new technologies and features 
examples include hair care appliances utilizing ionic technology and ceramic  rather than traditional  heating surfaces 
we also experienced increased sales in our vidal sassoon r line of hair clippers  as well as hair care appliances sold under our wave rage tm trade name 
partially offsetting the gains discussed above  our fiscal net sales of hair brushes  combs and accessories were lower than in fiscal north american segment sales remained relatively constant from fiscal to fiscal  increasing by less than one percent 
in the retail distribution channel  our new line of ion hair care appliances and our private label products produced sales increases 
slight decreases in sales of some of our branded hair care and personal care appliances  as well as lower sales of brushes  combs  and accessories offset partially the sales increases 
sales in the north american professional distribution channel grew mainly because of new product introductions and the expansion of some of our larger customers in this channel of distribution 
the weakness of the us economy in fiscal  relative to the recent past  contributed to a difficult north american sales environment 
the north american segment s operating income grew  or percent  for fiscal  compared to fiscal operating income in the north american segment was percent of sales  compared to percent in fiscal the sales growth discussed above was a significant factor in the north american segment s achievement of higher operating income 
the north american segment benefited from the absence of goodwill amortization during fiscal  due to the adoption of sfas  and achieved better gross margins in fiscal than fiscal the increased gross margins were attributable primarily to more efficient product sourcing 
in addition  the north american segment benefited during fiscal from the reclassification of  that was accrued during fiscal for anticipated customer credits related to the artificial fingernails business  but was not needed for that purpose 
this amount was reclassified in fiscal to accrue for customer credits related to other products 
operating income generated by the north american segment increased percent in the fiscal year ended february   compared to the same period a year earlier 
expressed as a percentage of sales  the north american segment s operating income rose from percent to percent from fiscal to fiscal the improved north american operating results were primarily the result of higher gross profit margins  arising from favorable changes in the mix of products sold and our ability to source product more efficiently 
international segment the international segment sells hair care and other personal care and comfort appliances  hairbrushes  combs  utility and decorative hair accessories  liquid hair care products  and liquid and powder skin care products outside of the us and canada 
the international segment  like the north american segment  sells primarily to mass merchandisers  drug chains  warehouse clubs  grocery stores  and beauty supply retailers and wholesalers 
net sales in the international segment grew  or percent from fiscal to fiscal as discussed in the north american segment sales analysis above  on october   we expanded our product lines into the liquid and powder hair and skin care category by acquiring four brand names and licenses to sell products under two additional brand names 
sales of liquid and powder hair and skin care products under the six new brand names resulted in  of sales growth in the international segment 
exclusive of these sales our international segment grew percent 
the international segment sales increase  exclusive of the liquid and powder products  is mainly comprised of improved sales in the united kingdom uk 
the introduction of hair straighteners under the vidal sassoon r trade name in the uk produced part of the sales growth  while the introduction of a new line of hair care appliances under the cosmopolitan trade name contributed the balance 
the strengthening during fiscal of the british pound and the euro versus the us dollar also had a positive effect on our international segment s net sales 
increased sales in latin and south america  france  and the uk drove international segment net sales up percent during fiscal the growth in latin america and south america was attributable to our successful efforts to increase distribution by expanding our customer base in that geographic area 
the net sales increase in france was due both to the development of relationships with a larger number of customers and the growth of our business with existing customers 
expanded sales to some of our larger customers in the uk drove sales increases there 
the international segment generated  of operating income  compared to a  operating loss in fiscal higher net sales  along with better gross profit margins  were keys to the international segment s improved operating results for fiscal as was the case with the north american segment  more efficient sourcing contributed to the international segment s improved gross margins 
foreign currency exchange gains also increased the international segment s operating profits by approximately  our operations in the uk  germany  and france purchase inventory using united states dollars and bill customers in british pounds or euros upon selling such inventory 
this method of purchasing and billing combined with a weakening us dollar to produce foreign exchange gains during fiscal our international segment incurred an operating loss of  in fiscal  compared to operating income of  in fiscal during fiscal  we experienced collection difficulties with a customer in the latin and south american market  as well as several customers in the middle east 
we are currently exploring strategies that might reduce our credit risk in the latin and south american market 
in addition to collection difficulties  inventory markdowns and currency exchange losses contributed to the international segment s fiscal operating loss 
tactica segment we own a percent interest in tactica international  inc tactica 
tactica sells a variety of personal care and other products to retailers and directly to consumers 
tactica uses television and print media advertising extensively 
as a result  tactica incurs higher sg a expenses  as a percentage of sales  than the north american and international operating segments 
at the time that we acquired tactica  we determined that use of the purchase method of accounting and consolidation was appropriate and we continue to use that method of consolidation 
tactica had accumulated a net deficit at the time that we acquired our interest in it and the minority shareholders have not adequately guaranteed their portion of the accumulated deficit 
at february   tactica s accumulated deficit totaled  therefore  our consolidated statements of income for fiscal  and include percent of tactica s net earnings or loss 
we will continue to recognize all of tactica s net income or loss until such time as tactica s  accumulated deficit is extinguished 
tactica s fiscal net revenues decreased percent  compared to fiscal sales of tactica s epil stop r hair removal products decreased approximately percent  with this change being the primary reason for tactica s lower net revenues 
we expect tactica s fiscal net revenues to remain relatively constant  compared to fiscal please refer to the section below entitled risk factors regarding this and other forward looking statements 
during fiscal  tactica s net revenues increased to over four times their fiscal levels 
epil stop r products played the most significant role of any product in tactica s fiscal sales increase 
the electrosage tm muscle stimulation exercise product line and the new twist a braid tm hair styling accessory also contributed to higher fiscal sales 
due mainly to the sales decrease discussed above  tactica s operating income decreased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal in addition to lower sales  tactica also achieved slightly lower gross profit  as a percentage of sales  in fiscal than in fiscal as its sales mix shifted more heavily toward retailers and away from sales directly to consumers 
because its sales decreased  tactica experienced an increase in sg a as a percentage of sales  despite lowering its sg a spending by approximately tactica s operating income of  in fiscal was a  improvement over its fiscal operating loss of  tactica s improvement in net sales was the primary factor leading to its better operating results in fiscal higher fiscal revenues produced more gross profit for tactica and caused its sg a expenses  as a percentage of sales  to decrease 
interest expense and other income expense interest expense was  or percent  lower in fiscal than in fiscal we did not borrow any funds under our line of credit during fiscal  as opposed to fiscal  when we borrowed funds during the first three quarters of that fiscal year and incurred the related interest expense 
during fiscal  our interest expense consisted entirely of interest on our fixed rate long term notes payable 
interest expense increased percent  or  from fiscal to fiscal this was largely due to increased borrowings under our line of credit during the first three quarters of fiscal the increase in borrowings was due to our relatively high levels of inventory purchases early in the year 
such purchases enabled us to obtain products from suppliers at favorable prices 
the increase of  or percent  in our other income for fiscal  over fiscal  was due mainly to the fact that we had more cash available for investment during most of fiscal than fiscal other income decreased to  in fiscal  compared to  in fiscal the primary reason for the decrease was a drop in income from the sale and appreciation of trading securities from approximately  in fiscal to  in fiscal interest income also fell because of lower interest rates and because of lower cash balances for most of fiscal versus fiscal income tax expense our fiscal income tax expense was percent of net income before taxes  a rate relatively constant with the percent rate that we experienced in fiscal because of our corporate structure  the earnings produced by our north american and international operating segments are generally taxed at lower rates than earnings produced by tactica 
the north american and international segments  combined  contributed a significantly larger portion of our earnings in fiscal than in fiscal this change in the mix of our earnings served to reduce our consolidated effective income tax rate 
however  as discussed below  we removed a valuation allowance from a deferred tax asset during fiscal  thereby making that year s effective income tax rate lower than it otherwise would have been 
this factor offset the reduction of income taxes as a percentage of earnings before income taxes  caused by the reduction in tactica s contribution to pre tax earnings 
in fiscal our income tax expense was percent of net income before income taxes  as opposed to percent in fiscal the main reason for this change was tactica 
as mentioned above  tactica usually incurs higher income tax rates than do our other two segments combined 
because tactica produced net income during fiscal  as opposed to a loss in fiscal  our fiscal effective tax rate rose 
the removal during fiscal of a valuation allowance from a  deferred tax asset reduced tactica s income tax expense for fiscal liquidity and capital resources during fiscal  we funded several significant capital  trademark  and license expenditures with cash generated internally 
our largest such expenditures consisted of the purchase of four trade names and the rights under licenses for two additional trade names 
we now sell hair care liquids and skin care liquids and powder under those six brand names 
in addition  we purchased a warehouse in mississippi and entered an agreement with a licensor whereby we prepaid royalties due in future years 
we used approximately  of cash in these transactions and ended the year with cash of more than  operating activities provided  during fiscal  compared to  during fiscal the primary reason for the difference between these two figures was our use of  to prepay royalties under a license agreement in connection with alterations to the terms of that agreement 
investing activities used  of cash during fiscal  compared with  in fiscal  mainly because of our purchase of a warehouse in mississippi and our acquisition of four trade names under which we will sell hair care liquids and skin care liquids and powder  as well as licenses to sell such products under two additional trade names 
the new warehouse replaces space that we were leasing in a warehouse operated by a third party in the southeast 
the purchase of the brand names and rights under licenses allows us to expand into an additional portion of the personal care market 
we believe that this transaction will result in increased net sales and earnings for the company 
net accounts receivable decreased percent from february  to february  this decrease is largely a result of the timing of our fourth quarter sales 
our sales during the first month of the fourth quarter were higher in fiscal than in fiscal the reverse was true of sales for the third month of the quarter 
this pattern resulted in earlier collection of fiscal fourth quarter sales  compared to fiscal our february  inventory balance increased percent  compared to the same time a year earlier  while net sales grew by percent 
the primary reason for the difference between the percentage increase in inventory and sales was an increase in the tactica segment s inventory  while its sales decreased 
our working capital balance decreased to  at february   from  at february  our current ratio was at february  compared to at february  the decreases in our working capital and current ratio resulted from the conversion of cash into non current assets in connection with the purchases of brand names and a new warehouse facility  as well as the prepayment of royalties  all of which are discussed earlier in this section 
in connection with its acquisition of a percent interest in tactica  the company loaned  to the minority shareholders of tactica 
the annual interest rate on these loans is percent 
all principal and unpaid interest on these loans is due march  these loans are secured by the shares of tactica held by the minority shareholders 
the total amounts of principal and accrued interest due to the company under the loans to tactica s minority shareholders were  and  at february  and  respectively 
these amounts are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets 
we maintain a revolving credit loan with a bank to facilitate short term borrowings and the issuance of letters of credit 
this line of credit allows borrowings totaling  incurs interest at the three month libor rate plus a percentage that varies based on the ratio of the company s debt to its earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization ebitda  and expires august  at february  the interest rate charged under the line of credit was percent 
this line of credit allows for the issuance of letters of credit up to  any outstanding letters of credit reduce the  maximum borrowing limit on a dollar for dollar basis 
at february   there were no borrowings under this line of credit and outstanding letters of credit totaled  the revolving credit agreement provides that the company must satisfy requirements concerning its minimum net worth  debt to capitalization ratio  debt to ebitda ratio and its fixed charge coverage ratio 
the company is in compliance with all of these requirements 
under the terms of the revolving credit agreement  one of our us subsidiaries is the borrower 
our parent company  located in bermuda and three of our us subsidiaries fully guarantee any amounts outstanding under the revolving line of credit on a joint and several basis 
our  of long term debt is comprised of a group of unsecured senior notes with face values totaling  and an annual interest rate of percent  as well as an unsecured senior note with a face value of  and an annual interest rate of percent 
we pay interest on these notes each calendar quarter 
the  group of senior notes requires annual principal payments of  beginning january   with the final payment due january  the  senior note requires annual principal payments of  beginning july   with the final payment due july  the senior notes contain covenants that require the company to meet certain net worth and other financial requirements 
additionally  the senior notes restrict the company from incurring liens on any of its properties  except under certain conditions 
the company is in compliance with all the terms of these notes 
under the terms of the senior notes  one of our us subsidiaries is the borrower 
our parent company  located in bermuda  one of our subsidiaries located in barbados  and three of our us subsidiaries fully guarantee the senior notes on a joint and several basis 
capital and license expenditures totaled   and  in fiscal   and  respectively 
capital and license expenditures during fiscal included  associated with our purchase of a new warehouse facility in mississippi   paid for the acquisition of the rights to sell sea breeze r and vitapointe r products under a license agreement  and  paid in connection with the renewal and alteration of terms of a license agreement 
we also used  of cash to acquire trademarks 
we are in the process of replacing certain of our key information technology systems 
we estimate that we will spend a total of approximately  to  on this project  with the expenditures occurring during fiscal and fiscal it is our expectation that we will capitalize at least percent of the amount spent on the information technology project 
in addition  we plan to move our uk operation into a new office facility during fiscal we expect to make a capital expenditure of approximately  in connection with the construction of our new office facility in the uk 
we expect to pay for the information technology project and the new uk office facility with funds generated internally 
our contractual obligations and commercial commitments  as of february  were payments due by contractual obligations period in s after total year years years years years years long term debt       open purchase orders inventory   minimum royalty payments        advertising commitments under license agreements      management fees corporate jet  operating leases   new office facility in uk   purchase of software   total contractual obligations        our percent owned subsidiary  tactica international  inc tactica leases office space in new york city 
one of our us subsidiaries has issued a  standby letter of credit to the lessor 
the lessor may draw funds from the standby letter of credit if tactica fails to pay its rent 
the standby letter of credit decreases to  on april  and expires on the same date as the related lease  february  we do not engage in any activities involving special purpose entities or off balance sheet financing 
based on our current financial condition and current operations  we believe that cash flows from operations and available financing sources will continue to provide sufficient capital resources to fund the company s ongoing liquidity needs for the foreseeable future 
other than the planned capital expenditures discussed above  we expect that our capital needs will stem primarily from the needs to purchase sufficient levels of inventory and to carry normal levels of accounts receivable on our balance sheet 
in addition  we evaluate acquisition opportunities on a regular basis and might augment our internal growth with acquisitions of complementary businesses and product lines 
we might finance acquisition activity with available cash  the issuance of stock  or with additional debt  depending upon the size and nature of any such transaction and upon conditions in the capital markets 
acquisition of trade names and licenses on october   we acquired from the procter gamble company the right to sell products under six trade names 
we acquired all rights to the trademarks  formulas  and production processes for four of the six trade names  ammens r  vitalis r  condition in r  and final net r 
the procter gamble company assigned to us its rights under licenses to sell products bearing the other two trade names  sea breeze r and vitapointe r 
the sea breeze r license is perpetual 
the portion of the purchase price assigned to the four trademarks purchased is included in our consolidated balance sheet as of february  on the line entitled trademarks  net of accumulated amortization 
we have concluded that the useful economic lives of these trademarks are indefinite  meaning that they are not subject to amortization 
this conclusion was reached after consideration of the history of the brands and of our plans and forecasts for sales of products under these trademarks 
the portion of the purchase price assigned to the rights obtained under the sea breeze r and vitapointe r licenses appears on our consolidated balance sheet as of february  on the line entitled license agreements  at cost less accumulated amortization 
after consideration of the fact that the sea breeze r license is perpetual and an analysis of the history of the brand as well as our plans and forecasts with respect to the brand  we determined that the sea breeze r license has an indefinite economic useful life 
therefore it is not subject to amortization 
the vitapointe r license expires on december  although  our long range expectation is to renew this license upon its expiration  we determined that the finite nature of this license indicates that it has a definite life and is  therefore subject to amortization 
we expect annual amortization expense associated with the vitapointe r license to be approximately  trademark license agreement renewal during december  we signed a new agreement with the procter gamble company to sell appliances and combs  hair brushes  and accessories using the vidal sassoon trade name 
the agreement allows us to sell products under the vidal sassoon trade name worldwide except in australia  china  hong kong  india  indonesia  japan  korea  malaysia  new zealand  the philippines  singapore  taiwan  and thailand 
in connection with the new agreement  we paid a  non refundable licensing fee  which we will amortize over the agreement s initial term  january through december in addition  we are obligated under the agreement to pay royalties on a quarterly basis 
we also have options to extend the agreement for two additional ten year periods 
non monetary transactions during fiscal  we entered into two non monetary transactions in which we exchanged inventory with a net book value of approximately  for advertising credits 
as a result of these transactions  we recorded both sales and cost of goods sold equal to the exchanged inventory s net book value 
we used approximately  of the advertising credits during fiscal and expect to use the remaining advertising credits by february  the remaining credits are valued at  on our consolidated balance sheet at february  and are included in the line item entitled prepaid assets 
critical accounting policies the us securities and exchange commission defines critical accounting policies as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results  and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
preparation of our financial statements involves the application of several such policies 
these policies include consolidation of tactica international  inc tactica under the purchase method  estimates of our exposure to liability for income taxes in hong kong  estimates of credits to be issued to customers for sales that have already been recorded  the calculation of our allowance for doubtful accounts  and the valuation of inventory on a lower of cost or market basis 
consolidation of tactica in march fiscal  we acquired a percent interest in tactica 
at that time  we determined that use of the purchase method of accounting and consolidation was appropriate and we continue to use that method of consolidation 
because tactica had accumulated a net deficit at the time that we acquired our interest in it and because the minority shareholders of tactica have not adequately guaranteed their portion of the accumulated deficit  our consolidated statements of income for fiscal  and include percent of tactica s net income or loss 
we will continue to recognize all of tactica s net income or loss until such time as tactica s accumulated deficit is extinguished 
hong kong income taxes the inland revenue department the ird in hong kong assessed tax on certain profits of the company s foreign subsidiaries for the fiscal years through during fiscal  we came to an agreement with the ird  settling its assessment for fiscal through for approximately percent of the amount originally assessed 
the ultimate resolution of the remaining ird claims cannot be predicted with certainty 
however  we have recorded a liability for the ird s claims  based on consultations with outside hong kong tax experts as to the probability that some or all of the ird s claims prevail 
such liability is included in income taxes payable on the consolidated balance sheets 
if the ird s position were to prevail and it were to assert the same position with respect to fiscal years after  the resulting tax liability could total  us for the period from fiscal through fiscal estimates of credits to be issued to customers we regularly receive requests for credits from retailers for returned products or in connection with sales incentives  such as cooperative advertising and volume rebate agreements 
we reduce sales or increase selling  general  and administrative expenses  depending on the nature of the credits  for estimated future credits to customers 
our estimates of these amounts are based either on historical information about credits issued  relative to total sales  or on specific knowledge of incentives offered to retailers 
valuation of inventory we account for our inventory using a first in first out system in which we record inventory on our balance sheet at the lower of its cost or its net realizable value 
determination of net realizable value requires management to estimate the point in time at which an item s net realizable value drops below its cost 
we regularly review our inventory for slow moving items and for items that we are unable to sell at prices above their original cost 
when we identify such an item  we reduce its book value to the net amount that we expect to realize upon its sale 
this process entails a significant amount of inherent subjectivity and uncertainty 
carrying value of long lived assets we apply the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas in assessing the carrying values of our long lived assets 
sfas and sfas both require that a company consider whether circumstances or conditions exist that suggest that the carrying value of a long lived asset might be impaired 
if such circumstances or conditions exist  further steps are required in order to determine whether the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair market value 
if analyses indicate that the asset s carrying value does exceed its fair market value  the next step is to record a loss equal to the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value 
the steps required by sfas and sfas entail significant amounts of judgment and subjectivity 
we did not record any charges for impairment of long lived assets during fiscal economic useful life of intangible assets we apply statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas in determining the useful economic lives of intangible assets that we acquire and that we report on our consolidated balance sheets 
sfas requires that companies amortize intangible assets  such as licenses and trademarks  over their economic useful lives  unless those assets economic useful lives are indefinite 
if an intangible asset s economic useful life is deemed to be indefinite  that asset is not amortized 
when we acquire an intangible asset  we consider factors such as the asset s history  our plans for that asset  and the market for products associated with the asset 
we consider these same factors when reviewing the economic useful lives of our previously acquired intangible assets as well 
we review the economic useful lives of our intangible assets at least annually 
the determination of the economic useful life of an intangible asset requires a significant amount of judgment and entails significant subjectivity and uncertainty 
in addition to the above policies  several other policies  including policies governing the timing of revenue recognition  are important to the preparation of our financial statements  but do not meet the definition of critical accounting policies because they do not involve subjective or complex judgments 
risk factors our financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by changes in tax laws 
currently  we benefit from an international corporate structure that produces relatively low tax effective tax rates on a consolidated basis 
if we were to encounter changes in the rates or rules imposed by certain key taxing jurisdictions  such changes could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position and profitability 
in  we engaged in a corporate restructuring that  among other things  resulted in a greater portion of our income not being subject to taxation in the us if such income were subject to us federal income taxes  our effective income tax rate would increase materially 
several bills have been introduced recently in the us congress that  if enacted into law  could adversely affect our us federal income tax status 
in addition to the legislation introduced in congress  the us treasury department has published a study of restructurings such as ours 
it is not currently possible to predict whether the legislation that has been introduced will become law  whether any additional bills will be introduced or the consequences of the us treasury department s study 
however  there is a risk that new laws in the us could eliminate or substantially reduce the current income tax benefits of our corporate structure 
if this were to occur  such changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition to potential changes in tax laws  the company s position on various tax matters may be challenged 
our ability to maintain our position that the parent company is not a controlled foreign corporation as defined under the us internal revenue code is critical to the tax treatment of our non us earnings 
a controlled foreign corporation is a non us corporation whose largest non us shareholders non us  those owning or more of its stock together own more than of the stock in such corporation 
if a change of ownership of the company were to occur such that the parent company became a controlled foreign corporation  such a change could have a material negative effect on the largest us shareholders and  in turn  on the company s business 
the hong kong inland revenue department has challenged our position on certain profits and assessed taxes on such profits 
we have settled certain of the challenges  however  certain amounts are still outstanding and we may have to pay further material amounts in the future 
the hong kong inland revenue department the ird assessed  in tax on certain profits of our foreign subsidiaries for the fiscal years through hong kong taxes income earned from certain activities conducted in hong kong 
we are vigorously defending our position that we conducted the activities that produced the profits in question outside of hong kong 
the company also asserts that it has complied with all applicable reporting and tax payment obligations 
in connection with the ird s tax assessment for the fiscal years through  we were required to purchase  us in tax reserve certificates in hong kong  which represented approximately of the liability assessed by the ird 
tax reserve certificates represent the prepayment by a taxpayer of potential tax liabilities 
the amounts paid for tax reserve certificates are refundable in the event that the value of the tax reserve certificates exceeds the related tax liability 
these certificates are denominated in hong kong dollars and are subject to the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations 
the ird also assessed  in tax on certain profits of our foreign subsidiaries for fiscal through during the second quarter of fiscal  the company and the ird agreed on a settlement for fiscal years through the company and the ird agreed to settle the amount for  of the assessed amount  plus interest of approximately  in addition to the tax reserve certificates discussed above  we previously purchased  in tax reserve certificates in connection with the ird s assessment for through we were able to apply these reserve certificates to amounts due under the settlement 
we paid the ird approximately  of additional cash  plus interest to settle the issues raised by the ird for fiscal through the settlement of the ird s assessments for fiscal through did not affect the status of the ird s assessments for fiscal years through if the ird s position were to prevail and if it were to assert the same position for years after fiscal  the resulting assessment could total  us for the period from fiscal through fiscal although the ultimate resolution of the ird s claims cannot be predicted with certainty  we believe that adequate provision has been made in the financial statements for the resolution of the ird s assessments for the fiscal years through and potential future assessments relating to activity since fiscal however  such provisions do not reserve for the full amount of such contingency and if the ird s position was to prevail the company s financial condition and future results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
a few customers account for a substantial percentage of our sales 
our financial condition and results of operations could suffer if we lost all or a portion of the sales to these customers 
we are dependent on certain principal customers 
wal mart stores  inc and its affiliate  sam s club accounted for approximately percent of the company s net sales in fiscal our top three customers accounted for approximately percent of fiscal net sales 
although we have long standing relationships with our major customers  no contracts require these customers to buy from us 
a substantial decrease in sales to any of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the sales of our tactica products are very volatile 
accordingly  our financial condition could be adversely affected and the results of operations could fluctuate materially 
tactica s net sales increased by approximately percent from fiscal and fiscal and decreased by approximately percent from fiscal to fiscal tactica s net sales comprised approximately percent and percent of the company s consolidated net sales during fiscal and  respectively 
tactica sells some products that have short life cycles 
furthermore  tactica relies on television infomercials and direct response marketing campaigns for the marketing of some of its products 
accordingly  tactica s sales could continue to be more volatile than the sales of our other two segments 
our financial position could be adversely affected and the results of operations could fluctuate materially because of the volatility of sales of tactica products 
one of our subsidiaries is subject to a stockholders agreement with the former stockholders of tactica 
under the terms of the stockholders agreement  under certain circumstances we could be required to buy the remaining outstanding shares of tactica or sell our tactica shares to a third party 
the company s financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected if it was forced to change its ownership position in tactica 
one of our subsidiaries is a party to a stockholders agreement with the former owners of tactica  who retained a interest in tactica collectively the other tactica stockholders 
under the terms of the stockholders agreement  we have been granted the right to initiate a process whereby we can purchase  and the other tactica stockholders are required to sell  the shares they own 
in addition  the other tactica stockholders have the right to initiate a process regarding the sale of their remaining interest in tactica 
we may elect at our option not to purchase the shares owned by the other tactica stockholders and under the terms of the stockholders agreement the parties will then be required to initiate a procedure under which the entire business of tactica would be offered for sale to third parties 
in either case  the purchase price will be based upon fair market value as determined by independent appraisal 
a sale to a third party would be subject to the approval of the other tactica stockholders and us 
in the event that either party exercises its rights under the stockholders agreement  our financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected 
we are dependent on third party manufacturers  most of which are in the far east 
changes in foreign policy  international law or the internal laws of the countries where our manufacturers are located could have a material negative effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
all of our products are manufactured by unaffiliated companies  most of which are in the far east 
risks associated with such foreign manufacturing include changing international political relations  changes in laws  including tax laws  regulations and treaties  changes in labor laws  regulations  and policies  changes in customs duties and other trade barriers  changes in shipping costs  currency exchange fluctuations  local political unrest  and the availability and cost of raw materials and merchandise 
to date  these factors have not significantly affected our production in the far east 
however  any change that impairs our ability to obtain products from such manufacturers  or to obtain products at marketable rates  could have a material negative effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the recent outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars could disrupt the flow of finished goods that we purchase and re sell 
our subsidiary in hong kong assists in the procurement of a large portion of the products that we sell 
many of these products are produced in south china 
sars has been most prevalent in these two regions 
should a sars outbreak interfere with the operations of the third party factories from whom we purchase product or should it interfere with the operation of our office in hong kong  we might experience a shortage of inventory 
this type of shortage could have a material negative effect on our financial position  results of operations  and cash flow 
thus far  sars has had no effect on our business 
our industry is extremely competitive 
our business will suffer if we do not develop and competitively market products that appeal to consumers 
the personal care and comfort products industry is extremely competitive 
maintaining and gaining market share depends heavily upon price  quality  brand name recognition  patents  innovative designs of new products and replacement models  and marketing and distribution approaches 
we compete with domestic and international companies  some of which have substantially greater financial and other resources than those of the company 
we believe that our ability to produce reliable products that incorporate developments in technology and to satisfy consumer tastes with respect to style and design  as well as our ability to market a broad offering of products in each applicable category at competitive prices  are keys to our future success 
no assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully compete on the basis of these factors in the future 
we are materially dependent on our licensed trademarks as a substantial portion of our sales revenue comes from selling products under licensed trademarks 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to sell products under these trademarks 
a substantial portion of our sales revenue is derived from sales of products under licensed trademarks 
as a result  we are materially dependent upon the continued use of such trademarks  particularly the vidal sassoon r and revlon r trademarks 
actions taken by licensors and other third parties could diminish greatly the value of any of our licensed trademarks 
if we were unable to sell products under these licensed trademarks or the value of the trademarks were diminished by the licensor or third parties  the effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations could be both negative and material 
our business  financial condition and results of operations will suffer if we do not accurately forecast our customers demands 
because of our reliance on manufacturers in the far east  our production lead times are relatively long 
therefore  we must commit to production in advance of customer orders 
if we fail to forecast customer or consumer demand accurately we may encounter difficulties in filling customer orders or in liquidating excess inventories  or may find that customers are canceling orders or returning products 
distribution difficulties may have an adverse effect on our business by increasing the amount of inventory and the cost of storing inventory 
additionally  changes in retailer inventory management strategies could make inventory management more difficult 
any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our future acquisitions  if any  and new products may not be successful  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we may decide to grow our business through the acquisition of new product lines and businesses 
the acquisition of a business or of the rights to market specific products or use specific product names involves a financial commitment 
in the case of an acquisition  such commitments are usually in the form of either cash or stock consideration 
in the case of a new license  such commitments could take the form of license fees  prepaid royalties  and future minimum royalty and advertising payments 
while our strategy is to acquire businesses and to develop products that will contribute positively to earnings  there is no guarantee of such results 
anticipated synergies may not materialize  cost savings may be less than expected  sales of products may not meet expectations and acquired businesses may carry unexpected liabilities 
each of these factors could result in a newly acquired business or product line having a material negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations

 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
the company adopted sfas on march  sfas eliminates the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives 
amortization will continue to be recorded for intangible assets with definite useful lives 
sfas also requires at least an annual impairment review of goodwill and other intangible assets 
any asset deemed to be impaired is to be written down to its fair value 
we completed reviews of our goodwill to determine whether any of that goodwill was impaired 
based on the results of these reviews  we concluded that our goodwill was not impaired as of march  or march  therefore  we incurred no impairment charge as a result of the adoption of sfas because it eliminates the amortization of goodwill  sfas decreased our sg a expense by  for the fiscal year ended february  the following tables present the impact of sfas on net earnings and earnings per share had the standard been in effect for the fiscal years ended february   and in thousands  except per share amounts years ended february  in thousands  except per share amounts reported net earnings    adjustments amortization of goodwill   income tax effect net adjustments   adjusted net earnings    reported earnings per share basic

 business combinations sfas 
sfas requires all business combinations to be accounted for using the purchase method and requires the recognition of intangible assets apart from goodwill if they arise from contractual or legal rights or if they are separable from goodwill 
sfas applies to all business combinations initiated after june  we did not enter into any transactions during fiscal that required the application of sfas our fiscal purchase from the procter gamble company of four brand names and rights under licenses for two additional brand names was a purchase of specific assets  rather than a business combination 
in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas 
sfas requires that legal obligations associated with the retirement of an asset be recorded as liabilities as incurred and capitalized as part of the cost of the associated asset 
these obligations are then depreciated over the course of the asset s useful life 
we believe that sfas will have no effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in august  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets sfas 
we adopted the provisions of sfas effective march  sfas requires that companies consider whether indicators are present that would indicate impairment of any of their long lived assets 
if such indicators are present the company compares the projected future undiscounted cash flows from the asset to its book value 
if the cash flows exceed the book value  no further action is necessary 
if the book value exceeds the projected undiscounted cash flows  a loss is recognized for the excess of the asset s book value over its fair value 
sfas did not affect our consolidated financial statements as of or for the year ending february  in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas 
this statement amends statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas by providing alternative methods of transition to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
it also amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures of stock compensation information  including the method used to account for stock based compensation and the effects of that method on reported financial results in interim  as well as annual  financial statements 
we account for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
we recognize no compensation expense in our financial statements for stock options issued with exercise prices that equal or exceed the cost of our common stock on the date such options are issued 
as a result  we do not expect the provisions of sfas covering the transition to fair value method accounting for stock based compensation to affect our financial statements 
we make the disclosures required by sfas in note to our consolidated financial statements 
beginning with our financial statements as of and for the three months ended may   we will make the interim disclosures required by sfas in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin requires that a guarantor record a liability for and disclose certain types of guarantees 
for certain other guarantees  fin requires only disclosure in the notes to the financial statements 
we have not made any of the types of guarantees for which fin requires that a liability be recorded 
however  certain entities whose financial statements are a part of our consolidated financial statements have guaranteed obligations of other entities within our consolidated group 
fin requires disclosure of these guarantees and of our product warranties 
these disclosures are contained in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
fin requires that a company with an interest in a variable interest entity include such an entity in its consolidated financial statements if its financial interest in the entity indicates control 
the statement applies immediately to interests in all variable interest entities acquired after january  for other variable interest entities  fin is to be applied effective july  we have no interests in entities covered by fin therefore  we do not expect fin to affect our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates represent our primary financial market risks 
fluctuation in interest rates causes variation in the amount of interest that we can earn on our available cash 
interest on our long term debt is fixed at rates ranging from percent to percent 
increases in interest rates do not expose us to risk on this debt 
however  as interest rates drop below the rates on our long term debt  our interest cost can exceed the cost of capital of companies who borrow at lower rates of interest 
as mentioned in the liquidity and capital resources discussion  interest rates on our revolving credit agreement vary based on the three month libor rate and on our ratio of debt to ebitda 
therefore  the potential for interest rate increases exposes us to interest rate risk on our revolving credit agreement 
that agreement allows maximum borrowings of  at the end of fiscal  no borrowings were outstanding under this agreement 
however  if the need to borrow under the revolving credit agreement were to arise  higher interest rates would increase the cost of such debt 
we do not currently hedge against interest rate risk 
because we purchase a substantial majority of our inventory using us dollars  we are subject to minimal short term foreign exchange rate risk in purchasing inventory 
however long term declines in the value of the us dollar could subject us to higher inventory costs 
such an increase in inventory costs could occur if foreign vendors were to react to such a decline by raising prices 
sales in countries other than the united kingdom  germany  and france are transacted in us dollars 
our sales in the united kingdom are transacted in british pounds and our sales in france and germany are invoiced in euros 
when the us dollar strengthens against other currencies in which we transact sales  we are exposed to foreign exchange losses on those sales because our foreign currency sales prices are not adjusted for currency fluctuations 
when the us dollar weakens against those currencies  we could realize foreign currency gains 
in fiscal  our net sales denominated originally in currencies other than the us dollar totaled approximately  converted at average monthly exchange rates 
our fiscal foreign currency exchange gains totaled  during fiscal  we began hedging against foreign currency exchange rate risk by entering into forward contracts to exchange a total of  british pounds for us dollars at rates ranging from to dollars per british pound 
at february   one forward contract to exchange  british pounds for us dollars at a rate of us dollars per british pound remained outstanding 
we expect to enter into additional forward contracts to hedge foreign currency risk up to one year in advance in the future
