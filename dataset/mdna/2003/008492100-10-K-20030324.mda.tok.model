ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income as the primary indicator of the company s operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity 
in addition  our method of calculating ffo may not be comparable to the methods used by other reits and  accordingly  may be different from similarly titled measures reported by other companies

inflation the company s leases generally contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation on net income

the table below presents the principal payments in thousands and the weighted average interest rates on remaining debt  by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes 
thereafter total fixed rate debt        average interest rate construction loans    average interest rate variable rate debt    average interest rate the fair value in thousands is estimated at   and  for fixed rate debt  construction loans and variable rate debt  respectively 
the table above incorporates those exposures that exist as of december   it does not consider those exposures or positions  which could arise after that date 
as a result  the company s ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period and interest rates 
the company does not enter into financial instruments transactions for trading or other speculative purposes or to manage interest rate exposure 
a adverse change in interest rates on the portion of the company s debt bearing interest at variable rates would result in an increase in interest expense of approximately
