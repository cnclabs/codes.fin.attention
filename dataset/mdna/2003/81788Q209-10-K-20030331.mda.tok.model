our customers currently include leading mobile network operators and financial institutions 
with our corporate office in toronto  canada  we have development and sales offices around the world  including  hong kong  germany  switzerland  the united kingdom and the united states 
developments in restructuring and other charges during  we continued our cost reduction initiatives that we began in these efforts were implemented in order to reduce our overall operating costs and to realign our operating expenses and investments with a view to achieving operational profitability 
in the january phase of our restructuring program  we reduced our worldwide work force by people  closed redundant facilities  wrote down inventory assets that are no longer part of our future strategy and wrote down unused fixed assets 
in addition  as part of that phase of restructuring  we formed an alliance with computer sciences corporation csc 
csc provides application hosting services to support our current hosting agreements and we work with csc to assist our new customers with their hosting requirements 
as a result of these transactions  we recorded million in restructuring charges and million relating to the write down of redundant fixed assets 
in the august phase of our restructuring program  we initiated a further series of actions to reduce our operating costs  which we believe will help accelerate our path to profitability 
these actions were undertaken in part to balance our investment across our two key markets  the mobile network operator and financial services markets 
we reduced our workforce by approximately people globally 
with this latest reduction  we have re aligned our workforce to allow us to continue to focus on delivering software applications and infrastructure software to mobile network operators while servicing our global installed base of financial services clients 
as a result  in the third quarter of  we recorded million of restructuring charges and a million write down of redundant fixed assets 
this restructuring charge was partially offset in the third quarter by a reversal of  related to a favorable outcome on a previously provided for lease settlement 
write down of long term investments during the year  we reviewed the carrying value of our long term investments  which include minority investments in shares of privately held technology companies  and concluded that they had suffered an other than temporary decline in value 
accordingly  we recorded a million non cash charge as an other than temporary decline in the value of our long term investments 
stock option tender offer in january  because a large percentage of our outstanding options had exercise prices that were significantly higher than the prices at which our common shares then traded on the nasdaq national market and the toronto stock exchange  we initiated a voluntary stock option exchange program 
this program was offered to a majority of our employees  but not our directors  executive officers  selected senior personnel and some foreign based employees who due to local regulations were ineligible to participate in an exchange program 
approximately million options were tendered  accepted and cancelled under this program 
we recorded approximately million in stock compensation expense during the first quarter of related to the immediate recognition of deferred stock based compensation for those employees who chose to tender their options 
in august  we issued just under million options under this program 
also in august  in connection with this program we made a special grant of options to our directors  executive officers  senior personnel and employees ineligible for the exchange program and who were still with the company at the time of the grant 
we issued million options under this program   of which had been cancelled by december  as some recipients had left the company 
see note to our annual audited financial statements for the year ended december   for further details on the stock option exchange program 
critical accounting policies we periodically review our financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment 
as part of this process  we have reviewed our selection  application and communication of critical accounting polices and financial disclosures 
we have determined that our critical accounting policies relating to our core ongoing business activities are primarily those that relate to revenue recognition 
other important accounting polices are described in note to our audited annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  revenue recognition sources of revenue we derive revenue from licensing our products and providing related services  including installation  integration  training  maintenance and support  and application hosting services 
we recognize revenue from our license agreements when all the following conditions are met we have an executed license agreement with the customer reseller  we have delivered the software product to the customer reseller  the amount of the fees to be paid by the customer reseller is fixed and determinable  and collection of these fees is deemed probable 
typically  software license agreements are multiple element arrangements as they include related maintenance and implementation fees 
accordingly  the entire arrangement fee is allocated to each element in the arrangement based on the respective vendor specific objective evidence of value vsoe of each element 
for contracts for which we do not have sufficient vsoe  we use the residual method to record revenues 
under this method  as long as we have vsoe for all undelivered elements typically  services and maintenance we can record the remaining value of the contract as license revenue after allocating full value to the undelivered elements 
product revenue product revenue consists of the following fixed license fee arrangement a one time license fee for a fixed number of copies or unlimited use of the software with a perpetual term 
we typically recognize the upfront fees in the period the contract is executed or shortly thereafter 
variable license fee arrangement a variable license fee based on a per user fee with or without specified quarterly minimum payments 
we recognize revenue from these contracts on a quarterly basis as the amount is determined 
our revenue under this model will vary with the number of our customers end users 
however  over time  we believe that these fees will grow as our customers roll out services based on our products or solutions to substantial numbers of their customers 
reseller arrangement the reseller generally pays a non refundable licensing fee for our software and or a royalty fee based on the related number of users 
we recognize revenue associated with non refundable license fees when we have met our revenue recognition criteria for license agreements as outlined above 
solutions arrangement there are two key factors that distinguish what we consider to be a solutions sale versus a software and services sale 
firstly  in a solutions sale  there may initially be a higher mix of service revenue than in a software sale 
secondly  in a solutions sale the services include the development and implementation of customized software code and more complex interfaces than in a software sale  where the contracted services are primarily installation services 
recognition of revenue from such contracts will primarily be based on the percentage of work completed as described below under service revenue 
for licensing and services agreements that provide significant commitments to refunds and or penalties on the services and or license components should the system not perform according to expectations  we defer recognition of revenue for the amount subject to refund or penalty until we achieve contractually defined milestones or until customer acceptance has occurred  as the case may be for such agreements 
service revenue implementation and customer service fees revenue from implementation and customer services includes fees for implementation of our product offerings  consulting and training services 
in  services revenue also included fees earned from consulting projects  which required us to build customized code and more complex interfaces than we would for a typical installation 
customers are charged a fee based on time and expenses 
revenue from implementation and customer service fees is recognized as the services are performed or deferred until we achieve contractually defined milestones or until customer acceptance has occurred  as the case may be for such contracts 
maintenance fees we receive revenue from maintaining and servicing our products for customers 
the maintenance fee is typically equal to a specified percentage of the customer s license fee 
if associated with the fixed fee license model  the maintenance revenues received will be recorded as deferred revenue and recognized on a straight line basis over the contract period 
when associated with the variable fee license model  any maintenance payments will be recognized on a monthly basis as earned 
hosting fees we no longer provide hosting services directly  but instead have arranged an alliance with csc  whereby csc is our preferred hosting partner for current and future customer deployments where hosting is or will be required 
under our existing hosting contracts  we typically charge customers a monthly flat fee or a monthly fee based on the number of users 
the fees are recognized on a monthly basis 
for a more detailed description of revenue recognition polices  refer to note c of our annual audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with canadian generally accepted accounting principles 
these principles conform in all material respects with us generally accepted accounting principles 
revenue product revenue in the year ended december   product revenue decreased to million from million in due to poor economic conditions  our customers were reluctant to make large upfront commitments on license fees  and we experienced a reduction in the number of customers deploying our products and solutions 
service revenue service revenue decreased to million for the year ended december  from million in the decrease in service revenue is due to the decline in the number of projects implemented by our customers and the continuing general weakness in the economy 
operating expenses cost of revenue cost of revenue cor consists primarily of personnel costs associated with customer support  training  and implementations as well as amounts paid to third party consulting firms for those services  together with an allocation of expenses for our facilities and administration 
cost of revenue also includes software licenses paid for third party software used with our products 
cost of revenue was million for the year ended december   compared to million in cor decreased in as the number of projects deployed was down and because we eliminated costs not essential to our focus on our two key markets  the mobile network operator and financial services markets 
research and development research and development expenses include compensation of software development teams working on the continuing enhancement of our products as well as our quality assurance and testing activities 
these expenses also include independent contractors and consultants  software licensing expenses  and allocated operating expenses 
research and development r d decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to million in the decrease is a result of our and restructuring initiatives in which we reduced our r d headcount and developed a more streamlined  integrated and focused product road map and reduced duplication in the r d process 
we continue to evaluate our r d expenditure needs based on our new product architecture and services and the current market environment 
r d expense  as a percentage of revenue  was for the year ended december   compared to in sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses include compensation of sales and marketing personnel  public relations and advertising  trade shows  marketing materials and allocated operating expenses 
sales and marketing s m expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million in the decrease is a result of the reduction in the number of sales and marketing personnel and reduced spending on discretionary marketing programs as part of our restructuring efforts in and we continue to monitor our sales and marketing expenditures to ensure that they remain aligned with our targeted opportunities as well as prevailing market conditions 
general and administrative general and administrative g a expenses include salaries and benefits for corporate personnel and other general and administrative expenses such as facilities  travel and professional consulting costs 
our corporate staff includes several of our executive officers and our financial planning and control  legal  human resources and corporate administration staff 
our g a expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to million in the decrease in g a expenses reflected our efforts in our restructuring initiatives to reduce complexity in our business and to make our infrastructure efficient in order to support our business in the current market environment 
depreciation and amortization depreciation expense was million in the year ended december  compared to million in the decrease is a result of the decommissioning of our redundant fixed assets and reductions in our capital expenditure budget as part of our restructuring initiatives 
amortization expense decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million in the decrease is attributable to lower amortization as a result of the write down of intangibles and other assets in fiscal and the adoption of sfas no 
and cica handbook section  which require goodwill to be assessed for impairment only  rather than being amortized  on a prospective basis starting january  see significant accounting policies in the note to our consolidated financial statements 
the amortization expense in represents the amortization of acquired technology  which is being amortized over a period of two to five years 
as described in note of our consolidated financial statements  at the end of  the carrying value of goodwill was million and the carrying value of acquired technology was million 
stock based compensation stock based compensation primarily represents amortization of deferred stock based compensation that we recorded as a result of assuming  through our acquisitions  stock option plans that included unvested options and common shares 
this stock based compensation is being amortized on a straight line basis over the remaining vesting period of these options  which will end in also included in stock based compensation is the immediate recognition of stock compensation expense for those terminated employees who had options that immediately vested upon their termination  and the immediate recognition of the unamortized portion of the deferred stock compensation for those employees who tendered their options as part of our stock option exchange initiative in january stock based compensation decreased to million for year ended december   compared to million in the comparative periods in the decrease in resulted mainly from the fact that the expense included significant charges related to the immediate recognition of deferred stock based compensation associated with employees who were terminated as part of our restructuring plan in restructuring costs with the downturn in general economic conditions  in the second quarter of we began to identify areas to reduce costs and to implement a restructuring initiative 
we eliminated duplicate resources and positions  narrowed our product offerings and streamlined our operating processes 
as a result of these efforts  in the year ended december   we recorded million in restructuring costs 
we continued with this restructuring in and  as a result  we recorded a restructuring charge of million for year ended december  this was comprised of million in hosting exit costs  the majority of which related to fees to be paid to csc to assume the obligation to provide services under our hosting contracts  million in employee severance charges  million in lease exit costs related to the closing of several of our offices  and million for the write down of inventory assets that are no longer a part of our current business strategy 
in addition  we recorded a million charge in related to the decommissioning of our redundant fixed assets compared to million in included in our accrued liabilities as at december  is approximately million in restructuring reserve 
this includes severance costs of million  lease exit costs of million and hosting exit costs of million 
see note to our annual audited consolidated financial statements for further details 
interest income interest income decreased to  for the year ended december   compared to million in interest was derived from cash and cash equivalent balances and short term investments  representing primarily the unused portion of the proceeds from our issuances of common shares 
interest income is net of interest expense relating to our note payable 
interest income decreased in compared to because we have reduced holdings of cash and cash equivalent balances and short term investments and due to a significant decline in interest rates 
equity in loss of affiliate until october  we owned of the equity of maptuit  inc we accounted for our investment in maptuit using the equity method  which required us to adjust the original cost of the investment for our share of post acquisition income and losses  less dividends  but only to the extent that the carrying value of the investment was not less than zero 
as at december   the carrying value of maptuit was zero  therefore we did not record additional losses of maptuit for the year ended december  this compared to a loss of million for the year ended december  in october  we sold our interest in maptuit for proceeds of  net loss our net loss decreased to million for year ended december  compared to million in our net loss decreased due to the significant restructuring charges and write down of intangible assets recorded in and the substantial reduction in our operating expenses resulting from our restructuring initiatives 
also  we no longer amortize goodwill under sfas no 
and cica handbook section if sfas no 
and cica handbook section had been adopted in the year  the loss in that year would have been million 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue product revenue in the year ended december   product revenue increased to million from million in product revenue increased in compared to as a result of our acquisition of tantau and the increase in the number of customers licensing our products 
in addition  in  our product offerings were limited to our banking and brokerage products  whereas in  we generated more sales from our expanded suite of product offerings  including credit cards  alerts  payments and platform products 
in  we expanded our sales force and formed new relationships to gain customers outside of north america 
service revenue service revenue increased to million in the year ended december  compared to million in the change from was largely attributable to increases in consulting and implementation fees from additional customers and increases in maintenance fees due to growth in product sales 
the increase in consulting and implementation fees resulted primarily from the additional implementation services performed in connection with our banking and brokerage  credit card  payments and alerts product offerings 
in addition  in  we derived consulting revenue from performing strategic consulting work relating to assisting a number of customers with their wireless and mobile offerings 
operating expenses cost of revenue cost of revenue was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the increase was mainly due to the fact that in we had more customers for whom we were performing consulting and implementation work than we did in cost of revenue for the year ended december  was of revenue compared to for the same period in research and development research and development r d expenses increased to million in the year ended december  compared to million in the increase mainly reflected the growth in r d personnel in the first six months of before the restructuring  mainly as a result of our acquisitions of ezlogin  spyonit and tantau 
this increase also resulted from our investment in developing our payments solution 
r d expense  as a percentage of revenue  was for the year ended december  compared to for the same period in the goals of the restructuring and realignment of our business in  were to have a more streamlined  integrated and focused product road map and reduce duplication in the r d process 
we began to see benefits in our restructuring materialize in the third quarter of fiscal as r d expenses decreased in absolute dollars from the second quarter of  when the restructuring initiative began 
sales and marketing sales and marketing s m expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million in with the acquisition of tantau  these costs increased as we had additional sales personnel to manage our relationships with our major customers and strategic alliances and to expand our business in europe and the asia pacific region 
in addition  the increase in absolute dollars was attributable to our strategy of expanding our reach to new markets and of increasing our efforts to sell our suite of products 
s m expenses  as a percentage of revenues  increased to in the year ended december  from in general and administrative our g a expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from million in the increase in g a expenses reflected expenditures incurred in the first two quarters of  primarily related to the enhancement of our international infrastructure necessary to support our growing business as a result of acquiring tantau 
g a expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to for the year ended december  from for depreciation and amortization depreciation expense increased to million in the year ended december   compared to million in the increase reflected our capital spending in the first half of  relating to equipment for our hosting facilities  computer hardware  office furniture and leasehold improvements at our facilities to support the additional personnel that we had hired and or acquired through our acquisitions 
amortization expense increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million in the increase was mainly due to the amortization of the goodwill and acquired intangibles from our acquisitions of ezlogin  spyonit and tantau 
as a result of the write down of our intangible and other assets in the year ended december   as described in note of our consolidated financial statements  we had at the end of approximately million and million as the carrying value of goodwill and acquired technology  respectively 
stock based compensation stock based compensation increased to million for the year ended december  from million in the same period of most of the increase was attributed to the amortization of the deferred stock compensation recorded as part of the tantau acquisition in the first quarter this amount is being amortized over a maximum period of two years  starting january  and the immediate recognition of stock compensation expense for those terminated employees who had options that vested immediately upon their termination 
restructuring costs with the downturn in general economic conditions  we worked to identify areas to reduce costs by eliminating duplicate resources and positions  narrowing our product offerings and streamlining our operating processes 
as a result of this realignment  in the year ended december  we recorded a restructuring charge of million related to employee severance and lease costs for the closing of several of our offices 
in addition  we recorded million related to the decommissioning of our redundant fixed assets and million related to the immediate recognition of deferred stock based compensation expenses related to employees whose stock options vested upon termination of their employment 
included in our accrued liabilities at year end was approximately million in restructuring reserve relating to unpaid severance costs and lease exit costs 
write down of intangible and other assets and acquired businesses we performed an assessment of the carrying values of intangible and other assets recorded in connection with our various acquisitions tantau  spyonit and ezlogin 
the assessment was performed because a number of factors indicated that an impairment existed in the year ended december  the main indicators of impairment were the significant changes in valuations of companies in the technology sector  a reduction in the multiples used in valuing technology companies such as revenue multiples  significant negative industry and economic trends impacting both our current operations and expected future growth rates  and our decisions related to the abandonment of certain acquired technology 
based on these factors  we concluded that a significant other than temporary impairment existed with respect to our intangible assets  which primarily related to the goodwill and acquired technology associated with the acquisitions of ezlogin  spyonit and tantau 
in quantifying the impairment charge  we compared the expected future cash flows of each acquisition  including terminal value  to the respective carrying value of the assets of the business  including assigned goodwill 
variables in the cash flow included estimated revenue contribution to our overall revenue and estimated costs 
the cash flow periods used ranged between three and five years  consistent with the useful life of the related asset acquired 
the discount rate ranged between and percent and was based on the risk free rate  adjusted for risk factors of the acquired company 
as a result of our review  we determined that the carrying values of the acquired businesses were not fully recoverable 
accordingly  we recorded  in the year ended december   a million write down of intangible and other assets based on the amount by which the carrying amount of the intangible and other assets exceeded the fair value calculated as described in the preceding paragraph 
the goodwill and intangible assets write down primarily relates to the goodwill and intangible assets that arose in the businesses that we acquired primarily through the issuance of shares and replacement options which were valued  for accounting purposes  on the respective dates of the acquisition which was significantly higher than our share trading price at the time of determining the existence of an impairment 
acquired technology for year ended december   we performed a review of the carrying value of our web application event framework technology waef which we acquired from webhelp in march during the course of the review  we considered our future use of waef  in light of the restructuring of our business and the downturn in the economy and concluded that the waef technology was not expected to be a part of our future strategy 
as a result  we reduced the carrying value of this technology to zero and recorded a charge of million 
interest income interest income decreased to million in the year ended december   compared to million in the same period of interest was derived from cash and cash equivalent balances and short term investments  representing primarily the unused portion of the proceeds from our issuances of common shares  including  in particular  the proceeds from our initial public offering in the first quarter of interest income decreased in compared to because we had smaller holdings of cash and cash equivalent balances and short term investments 
equity in loss of affiliate we owned of the equity of maptuit  as of december  our investment in maptuit was accounted for using the equity method 
our share in the net loss of maptuit was million compared to a net gain of  in the net gain in consisted of an equity loss of  offset by a dilution gain of million recorded as a result of maptuit financings in write down of long term investments in the year ended december   we reviewed the carrying values of our long term investments 
due to adverse changes in operating market conditions  several of our long term investments in other companies had experienced a significant other than temporary decline in their values 
in order to determine the amount of the write down  we assessed the fair market value of these investments and compared them to the investments carrying values 
the fair market value of these investments was based on a combination of the following if public  recent trading prices and trend in trading prices  values indicated by recent rounds of financing in the investee company  valuations performed by the investee company or venture capitalists if the investee company is seeking a round of financing  and changes in the market value of the investment relative to industry indices 
for the year ended december   we realized losses on the sale of long term investments of million and recorded million as an other than temporary decline in value of our long term investments 
net loss we recorded a net loss of million for the year ended december  compared to net loss of million for our net loss increased as we recorded significant non cash charges for impairment in value of our intangible and other assets  other than temporary decline in value of our long term investments and amortization of goodwill related to our acquisitions and as we invested heavily in building our infrastructure 
in addition  prior to our adoption of our restructuring plan in june  our research and development expenses and our sales and marketing expenses increased to meet required product delivery schedules and to expand our market share 
in response to the downturn of the economy in  which affected our operations and expected growth rates  we adopted a restructuring plan to realign our operations to eliminate duplicate resources 
as a result of this decision  we recorded restructuring related charges in of million

net cash used in operating activities for consisted mainly of our net loss of million  offset by non cash items primarily related to depreciation and amortization of million  stock based compensation expense of million  and the write down of long term investments  intangible and other assets and fixed assets of million 
as at december   we had commitments to make million in minimum lease payments up to  primarily related to our facilities and equipment rentals 
as a result of our restructuring initiatives  we have vacated some of our premises and we have been successful in reducing our total future lease commitments with our landlords 
cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to a cash source of million in the reason for the decrease in cash inflow is that in we paid more principal on our outstanding note payable and we received less proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
as at december   we were obligated to pay approximately  in principal and interest related to our note payable  and the final payment was paid on february  cash used in investing activities  before the sale purchase of short term investments  business acquisitions and restricted cash was  in compared to a cash outflow of million for the year ended december  the reason for the decrease in cash outflow for the year ended december  compared to is that we significantly curtailed our purchase of capital and intangible assets in in total  cash used was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year due to the operational savings that we expect to achieve as a result of our restructuring  we expect that cash from the sales of our products and our existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to cover our cash requirements  including planned capital expenditures  for at least the next months 
we may require additional financing if we expand our operations at a faster rate than currently expected  or if we seek to effect one or more significant acquisitions 
recent accounting principles in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities fas  which is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  fas requires that a liability be recognized for exit or disposal costs only when the liability is incurred  as defined in the fasb s conceptual framework rather than when a company commits to an exit plan  and that the liability be initially measured at fair value 
the company is currently assessing the impact of the new standard 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin  which requires certain disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements for periods ending after december  about its obligations under guarantees 
fin also requires the recognition of a liability by a guarantor at the inception of certain guarantees entered into or modified after december  fin requires the guarantor to recognize a liability for the non contingent component of certain guarantees  that is  it requires the recognition of a liability for the obligation to stand ready to perform in the event that specified triggering events or conditions occur 
the initial measurement of this liability is the fair value of the guarantee at inception 
as at december   the company had no guarantees that require disclosures under the standard 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk impact of interest rate exposure as of december  we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and restricted cash of which million consisted of short term investments 
a significant portion of the cash earns interest at variable rates 
in addition  although our short term investments are fixed rate instruments  the average term is short 
accordingly  our interest income is effectively sensitive to changes in the level of prevailing interest rates 
this is partially mitigated by the fact that we generally do not liquidate our short term investments before their maturity dates 
impact of foreign exchange rate exposure our functional currency is the us dollar 
in the past  the majority of our non us dollar denominated expenses were incurred in canadian dollars 
as a result of our recent restructuring efforts  in the foreseeable future the majority of our non us dollar denominated expenses will be incurred in euros 
changes in the value of these currencies relative to the us dollar may result in currency gains and losses  which could affect our operating results 
in the year ended december   we incurred an unrealized foreign currency loss relating to the translation of our non us denominated monetary assets and liabilities of approximately
