critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
our application of accounting policies affects these estimates and assumptions 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes provision for doubtful accounts the provision for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and the aging of accounts receivable 
if there is a deterioration of a major customer s credit worthiness or actual defaults are higher than our historical experience  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts owed to us could be adversely affected 
inventory inventory purchases and commitments are based upon future demand forecasts 
if there is a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products  or there is a higher rate of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements  we may be required to reduce our inventory values resulting from lower of cost or market value adjustments and our gross profit could be adversely affected 
due to the shorter life cycles of digital products  the obsolescence risk is more significant as it relates to these products 
deferred taxes the deferred tax valuation allowance is based on our assessment of the realizability of our deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis and may be adjusted from time to time as necessary 
in determining the valuation allowance  we have considered future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning initiatives and strategies 
should we determine that it is more likely than not that we will realize certain of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment would be required to reduce the existing valuation allowance and increase income 
on the contrary  if we determine that we would not be able to realize our recorded deferred tax asset  an adjustment to increase our valuation allowance would be charged to the results of operations in the period such conclusion was made 
such charge could have an adverse effect on our provision for income taxes included in our results of operations 
sales returns a provision for sales returns is established based on historical trends in product returns 
if future returns are higher than we predicted based on the historical data  our net sales could be adversely affected 
impairment of long lived and other assets periodically  we review our long lived assets for impairment 
we will record an impairment loss when indications of impairment are present where undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amounts 
for royalty related assets  we will record an impairment loss if the total expected royalty payments to be made over the life of an agreement  excluding any minimum required payments  are less than the royalty related assets carrying value 
the total expected royalty payments to be made over the life of an agreement are dependent on management s estimates about future sales volumes 
because judgment is required to estimate future sales volumes  the estimates are not necessarily indicative of the sales volumes that will be actually realized in the future 
such assets that are reviewed include patents  goodwill  licensing and royalty agreements and certain property  plant and equipment 
accounting for litigation and settlements we are involved in various legal proceedings 
due to their nature  such legal proceedings involve inherent uncertainties including  but not limited to  court rulings  negotiations between affected parties and the possibility of governmental intervention 
management assesses the probability of loss for such contingencies and accrues a liability and or discloses the relevant circumstances  as appropriate 
management believes that any liability to the company that may arise as a result of currently pending legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the company taken as a whole 
off balance sheet arrangements under sec regulations  we are required to disclose the following off balance sheet arrangements  if applicable any obligation under certain guarantee contracts  any retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit  liquidity or market risk support to that entity for such assets  any obligation under certain derivative instruments  any obligation arising out of a material variable interest held by us in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to us  or engages in leasing  hedging or research and development services with us 
we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that we are required to disclose pursuant to these regulations  other than those described in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we do not have  nor do we engage in  transactions with any special purpose entities 
we are not engaged in hedging activities and had no forward exchange contracts outstanding at june  in the ordinary course of business  we enter into operating lease commitments  purchase commitments and other contractual obligations 
these transactions are recognized in our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  and are more fully discussed below in liquidity and capital resources

results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal net sales net sales for fiscal set a company record and were million  an increase of million  or  as compared to net sales for fiscal sales in both our rsd and dms businesses increased over last year 
for fiscal  rsd net sales were million  an increase of million  or over fiscal the increase in net sales resulted principally from new digital camera sales  sales of polaroid branded single use and traditional cameras  new accounts and organic growth from existing accounts due to sell through and new product introductions 
dms net sales were million for fiscal  an increase of million  or  as compared to fiscal the increase in dms sales was due primarily to sales of a new single use camera being manufactured for kodak under a supply agreement entered into in september  coupled with digital camera sales to a fuji subsidiary  legend group limited in the prc and visioneer  inc  and other sales to existing customers  partially offset by the previously disclosed expiration of certain dms contracts 
net sales of concord asia for fiscal were million  an increase of million  or  as compared to fiscal the increase was primarily due to higher dms net sales to kodak 
net sales of concord americas for fiscal were million  an increase of million  or  as compared to fiscal the increase was primarily due to new digital camera sales  the success of certain new marketing programs  increased penetration with existing customers  and the positive sell through of certain new products 
net sales of concord europe for fiscal were million  an increase of million  or  as compared to fiscal this increase was principally due to new digital camera sales 
gross profit gross profit for fiscal was million  an increase of million  or  as compared to fiscal gross profit margin gross profit expressed as a percentage of net sales increased to for fiscal as compared to for fiscal fiscal included a million pretax benefit related to a favorable dispute resolution partially offset by million of additional air freight costs due to the west coast dock worker s labor dispute  while fiscal included million of net inventory provisions 
additionally  fiscal gross profit margins were positively impacted by significantly increased sales accompanied by the related efficiency gains in manufacturing 
product development costs in dollars and as a percentage of net sales for fiscal and  included in cost of products sold  were million and million  respectively 
operating expenses selling expenses for fiscal were million  or of net sales 
last year  selling expenses were million  or of net sales 
the increase was primarily due to additional sales and marketing personnel  higher freight and handling costs  and royalties related to the polaroid brand licenses  all of which were attributable to the company s year over year sales growth 
general and administrative expenses were million  or of net sales for fiscal this compared to million  or of net sales last year 
fiscal general and administrative expenses included a million reduction in expense due to a payment from polaroid in settlement of concord s outstanding polaroid claims related to the polaroid bankruptcy filing  while fiscal general and administrative expenses included a million accounts receivable provision due to the polaroid bankruptcy  a million charitable contribution for victims of the september  terrorist attack  and a net million provision due to the kmart corporation bankruptcy 
the remaining elements of general and administrative expenses increased year over year by million primarily due to additional staffing  professional and insurance costs  and other costs associated with the company s growth 
in april  we uncovered a fraudulent scheme including check forgery by a former employee  which resulted in the embezzlement of million over an eighteen month period ending in april  the preponderance of which occurred in fiscal our investigation confirmed that the former employee acted alone and the misappropriated funds have been identified 
we have recovered all but million of the embezzlement from a combination of insurance proceeds  assets secured and amounts recovered from the individual 
accordingly  we have recorded accrued receivables  net of cash recoveries  of million and million in prepaid and other current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of june  and june   respectively 
in addition  we have recorded under the caption recovery of operating expenses  net in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for fiscal  million related to the recovery  which is net of million of expenses related to the investigation and recovery efforts 
the entire amount of the recovery was recorded in the third quarter of fiscal due to the fact that it was impractical to determine the impact on fiscal quarterly periods 
the embezzled amounts related to the prior fiscal year were not significant 
variable stock based compensation expense for fiscal was million as compared to no expense in fiscal  primarily because the company s common stock price was higher on june  than the october repriced stock options exercise price of and on june  was below the repriced stock options exercise price of 
see note  stock based compensation in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
interest expense decreased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the lower interest expense in fiscal was attributable to the repayment of the million  senior notes senior notes in august other income  net other income  net was million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
other income  net primarily includes investment income  foreign exchange gains and losses  directors fees  and certain investor relations costs 
fiscal included million of non recurring income from an arbitration award  while fiscal included million due to foreign exchange gains 
investment income for fiscal was million as compared to million for fiscal fiscal included higher investment income primarily attributable to higher interest rates 
income taxes as a company engaged in processing activities in the prc  we currently do not pay income or turnover taxes in the prc  but there can be no assurance we will not be required to pay such taxes in the future 
hong kong is taxed separately from the prc 
concord hk s annual tax rate increased from to effective for fiscal as a company engaged in processing activities in the prc  we have never paid any income or turnover tax to the prc related to those activities in the prc 
existing prc statutes can be construed as providing for a minimum of to income tax and a turnover tax on our processing activities  however  the prc has never attempted to enforce those statutes 
we have been advised that the prc s state tax bureau is reviewing the applicability of those statutes to processing activities of the type engaged in by us  but it has not yet announced any final decisions as to the taxability of those activities 
after consultation with our tax advisors  we do not believe any tax exposure we may have on account of our processing operations in the prc will be material to our financial statements 
we do not provide for us federal income taxes on undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries because we intend to permanently reinvest such earnings 
undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries approximated million as of june  it is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable if such earnings were ever remitted 
however  no withholding taxes would be payable under current law 
for us federal tax purposes  as of june   we have net operating loss carryforwards of million  of which million was attributable to deductions associated with stock option exercises  that expire as follows million in and the balance thereafter 
additionally  we have million of net operating loss carryforwards related to our foreign operations  million of which relates to hong kong  which have no expiration dates 
each year we evaluate our deferred tax assets 
as part of assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets  we evaluate whether it is more likely than not that some portion  or all of our deferred tax assets  will be realized 
the realization of our deferred tax assets relates directly to our tax planning initiatives and strategies for us federal and state and hong kong tax purposes 
as of june  and june  based on all the available evidence  we determined that it is more likely than not that our domestic and hong kong net deferred tax assets will be fully realized 
consequently  we did not adjust the valuation allowance  except for million related solely to the utilization of a potential capital loss associated with the company s short term investments 
we also evaluated our european net deferred tax assets and determined that million and million were to remain recorded as a valuation allowance as of june  and june   respectively 
for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  our effective tax rates were   and  respectively 
our future effective tax rate will depend upon the apportionment between foreign and domestic taxable income and losses  and the statutory rates of the related tax jurisdictions 
net income loss as a result of the matters described above  we reported net income of million  or per diluted share  for fiscal as compared to a net loss of million  or per share  for fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal net sales net sales for fiscal were million  a decrease of million  or  as compared to net sales for fiscal the decrease in net sales resulted principally from decreases in sales to dms customers partially offset by an increase in sales to new and existing rsd customers 
on a comparative basis  in fiscal the decrease in dms sales was attributed to the lack of sales of a certain digital product to a former customer  significantly lower sales of instant cameras  and decreases in sales of both digital and film based products 
the increase in rsd net sales was primarily due to increases in sales to leading retailers in the americas 
for fiscal  rsd net sales were million  an increase of million  or  as compared to fiscal for fiscal  dms net sales were million  a decrease of million  or as compared to fiscal net sales of concord asia for fiscal were million  a decrease of million  or  as compared to fiscal the decrease was due to lower dms net sales 
net sales of concord americas for fiscal  were million  an increase of  or as compared to fiscal the increase was primarily due to the success of certain new marketing programs  increased penetration with existing customers  and the positive sell through of certain new products 
net sales of concord europe for fiscal were million  a decrease of million  or as compared to fiscal gross profit gross profit for fiscal was million  a decrease of million  or as compared to fiscal gross profit margin decreased to for fiscal as compared to for fiscal the decrease in gross profit margin was attributable to i significantly lower net sales  ii a digital inventory provision of million  iii competitive price pressures and unfavorable absorption of manufacturing overhead and labor utilization  iv a provision of million related to specific product inventory for polaroid which filed for bankruptcy in october and v higher product development costs 
included in gross profit for fiscal were million of inventory provisions and million associated with a restructuring and cost containment program restructuring initiative that was initiated in june product development costs in dollars and as a percentage of net sales for fiscal and  included in the cost of products sold  were million and million  respectively 
operating expenses selling expenses decreased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the decrease was primarily due to a significant decline in net sales resulting in lower freight and certain other variable selling expenses  as well as a decrease in salaries  travel and entertainment and tradeshow expenses 
selling expenses  as a percentage of net sales  increased to for fiscal from for fiscal general and administrative expenses decreased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expenses decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal included in general and administrative expenses for fiscal were certain amounts aggregating million comprised of i a provision related to an account receivable of million associated with polaroid s bankruptcy filing  ii a net provision related to an account receivable of million associated with kmart s bankruptcy filing in january  iii a charitable contribution that the company made for victims of the september  terrorist attack in the amount of million  and iv a reversal in june of an accrual associated with the restructuring initiative of million which resulted in a reduction of general and administrative expenses 
the restructuring initiative was completed in june in fiscal  general and administrative expenses included a million provision for doubtful accounts for an account receivable associated with a former dms customer 
also  as a result of the restructuring initiative  general and administrative expenses included million of the million restructuring charge that the company recorded in its fourth quarter of fiscal terminated acquisition costs of million in fiscal related to a proposed acquisition that was not consummated 
negotiations regarding this acquisition were terminated in september interest expense decreased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the lower interest expense in fiscal was attributable to the decreased use of short term borrowings and the repayment of certain capital leases 
other income  net other income  net was million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
other income  net primarily includes investment income  foreign exchange gains and losses  directors fees  and certain public relations costs 
the decrease in fiscal was primarily attributable to lower investment income offset by million of income from an arbitration award 
income taxes income tax benefit was million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the increase in the income tax benefit is primarily due to the utilization of million of european valuation allowances in fiscal see income taxes under the fiscal compared to fiscal discussion for additional income tax information 
net loss as a result of the matters described above  we reported a net loss of million  or per share  for fiscal as compared to a net loss of million  or per share  for fiscal foreign currency transactions we operate on a worldwide basis and our results may be adversely or positively affected by fluctuations of various foreign currencies against the us dollar  specifically  the canadian dollar  european euro  british pound sterling  prc renminbi  hong kong dollar and japanese yen 
our foreign subsidiaries purchase the majority of their finished goods inventories in us dollars 
accordingly  the us dollar is the functional currency 
certain net sales to our customers and purchases of certain components and services are transacted in local currency including japanese yen  thereby creating an exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the translation from the applicable currencies to us dollars is performed for balance sheet accounts using current exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using a weighted average exchange rate during the period 
gains or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions and remeasurement are included in other income  net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
liquidity and capital resources a recent sec release requires us to disclose factors that are likely to affect our liquidity trends 
we are not aware of factors that are reasonably likely to adversely affect liquidity trends  other than those factors summarized under the caption risk factors in this report 
we do not have  nor do we engage in  transactions with any special purpose entities 
we are not engaged in hedging activities and had no forward exchange contracts outstanding at june  in the ordinary course of business  we enter into operating lease commitments  purchase commitments and other contractual obligations 
these transactions are recognized in our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  and are more fully discussed below 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  anticipated cash flow from operations  and amounts available under our credit facilities provide sufficient liquidity and capital resources for our anticipated short term working capital and capital expenditure requirements as well as our anticipated long term working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future 
working capital at fiscal year end  working capital was million as compared to fiscal year end working capital of million  a decline of million 
cash and investments decreased by million from million at june  to million at june  primarily as the result of the repurchase of the million senior notes and payment of million for fixed asset expenditures 
these two uses of cash  totaling million  were partially offset by a total of million of positive cash flow from operations and proceeds received from common stock issuance resulting from stock option and warrant exercises 
accounts receivable and inventory increased by and million  respectively  during fiscal as a result of our significant sales growth 
cash provided by operations cash provided by operations in fiscal was million  which compared favorably to cash used in operations of million for fiscal and favorably to cash used in operations of million for fiscal the changes in cash provided by operating activities for the respective fiscal years were primarily attributable to net income and changes in accounts receivable  inventories and accounts payable 
cash used in investing activities capital expenditures for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal were million  million  and million  respectively  and related primarily to expenditures on plant and equipment purchased for our manufacturing facilities in the prc 
the increase in fiscal was primarily the result of higher expenditures on plant and equipment purchases primarily related to digital camera production at our manufacturing facilities in the prc 
we anticipate capital expenditures will increase substantially in fiscal due to increased investments in plant and equipment at our manufacturing facilities in the prc in anticipation of increased revenue  as well as investment in a new enterprise resource planning software package for worldwide operations 
for fiscal  the decrease in cash from investing activities related to certain short term investments made in fiscal cash used in financing activities cash used in financing activities in fiscal was million 
this resulted from the repayment of the senior notes partially offset by proceeds received from common stock issuances resulting from stock option and warrant exercises 
cash used in financing activities in fiscal was million  which was primarily attributable to repayments of capital lease obligations 
in fiscal  cash provided by financing activities of million was primarily attributable to our public equity offering described more fully below in the fall of operating leases we entered into operating leases in the ordinary course of business eg  warehouse facilities  office space and equipment where the economic profile was favorable 
the effects of outstanding leases are not material to us in terms of either annual cash flow or total future minimum payments 
see note  commitments and contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
purchase commitments as part of the ordinary course of our business  we enter into and have purchase commitments for materials  supplies  services  and property  plant and equipment 
in the aggregate  such commitments are not at prices in excess of current market and typically do not exceed one year 
related party transactions we engaged in related party transactions as discussed in note  related party transactions  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
these transactions do not materially affect our results of operations  cash flows or financial condition 
other contractual obligations we do not have any material financial guarantees or other contractual commitments that are reasonably likely to adversely affect liquidity 
see hong kong financing facilities below for information about our financial guarantees 
hong kong financing facilities concord hk has various financing and revolving credit facilities in place providing an aggregate of approximately million in borrowing capacity 
certain of the revolving credit facilities are denominated in hong kong dollars 
since the hong kong dollar has been pegged to the united states dollar 
the revolving credit facilities are comprised of an approximately million import facility  an approximately million packing credit and export facility  an approximately million foreign exchange facility and an million accounts receivable financing facility collectively the hong kong financing facilities 
the million accounts receivable financing facility is secured by certain accounts receivable of concord hk and guaranteed by us 
we also guarantee the remaining amount of approximately million under the hong kong financing facilities 
availability under the accounts receivable financing facility is subject to advance formulas based on eligible accounts receivable and all the credit facilities are subject to certain financial ratios and covenants 
the hong kong financing facilities bear interest at variable rates 
at june   there were no amounts outstanding under the hong kong financing facilities 
united kingdom credit facility in november  our united kingdom subsidiary obtained a united kingdom credit facility the uk facility that was secured by substantially all of our united kingdom subsidiary s assets 
the uk facility bore interest at above the uk prime lending rate and was principally utilized for working capital needs and allowed borrowings of up to approximately million 
at june   there were no amounts outstanding under the uk facility 
the facility expired in august exchange offer on august   we launched an offer to exchange outstanding stock options that had an exercise price of more than per share for new options to purchase of the shares subject to the outstanding options at an exercise price of per share the closing price of the common stock reported on the nasdaq national market on the date the board of directors approved the exchange offer 
the exchange offer expired on october  we accepted for exchange and cancelled options to purchase a total of  shares of common stock and issued new options to purchase a total of  shares of common stock in exchange for the cancelled options 
as a result of the exchange offer  we are now required to apply variable accounting to these new stock options until the options are exercised  cancelled or expired 
for fiscal  we recorded million of variable stock based compensation expense in the consolidated statement of operations because our common stock price on june  was above the exercise price of 
for fiscal  we did not record any variable stock based compensation expense in the consolidated statements of operations because the company s stock price on june  was below the exercise price of 
because the determination of variable accounting expense associated with the repriced stock options is dependent  in part  on our closing stock price at the end of each prospective reporting period  it is not possible to determine its future impact  either favorable or unfavorable  on our financial statements 
common stock buy back programs in fiscal  we purchased  shares of our common stock on the open market for million as part of a board of directors the board approved common stock buy back program 
in february  we adopted an additional share repurchase program pursuant to which the board allocated up to million for the repurchase of shares of our common stock 
we have not repurchased any shares pending completion of a review of our other capital investment opportunities 
public equity offering on september   pursuant to an underwritten public offering  we sold million shares of our common stock at per share 
on october   pursuant to an over allotment option granted to the underwriters  we sold an additional  shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
we received net proceeds of million from the offering  after deducting offering costs and underwriting fees of million from the gross proceeds of million 
the use of the offering proceeds was intended for the repayment of outstanding indebtedness including capital leases  for capital expenditures and for general corporate and strategic purposes  including working capital and investments in new technologies  product lines and complementary businesses 
stock split on april   we effected a two for one stock split of our common stock through a stock dividend to shareholders of record on march  accordingly  share and per share data for all periods presented in this report have been restated to reflect the stock split 
senior notes on july   we consummated a private placement of million of unsecured senior notes that bore interest at 
in august  we repurchased all of these senior notes at slightly below par 
license agreement on august   we entered into our two polaroid licensing agreements 
the two license agreements provide for the exclusive with the exception of products already released by polaroid into the distribution chain worldwide use of the polaroid brand trademark in connection with the manufacture  distribution  promotion and sale of single use cameras and traditional film based cameras  including zoom cameras  and certain related accessories 
the licenses do not include instant or digital cameras 
each license includes an initial term of three and a half years and may be renewed  at our option  for an additional three year period 
each license agreement includes provisions for the payment of million of minimum royalties  which will be fully credited against percentage royalties 
through august  we have paid a total of million  which represented million for each license agreement  as partial payment of the minimum royalties 
litigation settlements on july   the company entered into a settlement agreement to dismiss a patent infringement complaint filed by the massachusetts institute of technology and electronic for imaging  inc against the company and to release the company from any and all claims of infringement of the patent at issue 
the company recorded the settlement amount under the caption accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheet as of june  the settlement is not material and does not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
growth opportunities we are evaluating various growth opportunities that could require significant funding commitments 
we have from time to time held  and will continue to hold  discussions and negotiations with i companies that represent potential acquisition or investment opportunities  ii potential strategic and financial investors who have expressed an interest in making an investment in or acquiring us  iii potential joint venture partners looking toward formation of strategic alliances that would broaden our product base or enable us to enter new lines of business and iv potential new and existing dms customers where the design  development and production of new products  including certain new technologies  would enable us to expand our existing business  and enter new markets including new ventures focusing on wireless connectivity and other new communication technologies 
however  there can be no assurance that any definitive agreement will be reached regarding any of the foregoing  nor does management believe that such agreements are necessary for the successful implementation of our strategic plans 
risk factors you should carefully consider the following risks regarding our company 
these and other risks could materially and adversely affect our business  operating results or financial condition 
you should also refer to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this report 
most of our operations in the people s republic of china prc are subject to administration of its local governmental agencies 
the continuing viability of our prc agreements is crucial to our business operations in the prc 
we manufacture a majority of the components used in our cameras and assemble all of our manufactured finished products in the prc 
we currently have approximately  workers in the prc either employed by our prc subsidiaries or through our agreements with various prc government or quasi government agencies 
we are responsible for their wages and housing and must comply with a variety of local labor and employee benefit laws covering these workers 
while we believe we are in substantial compliance with applicable laws as currently enforced  these laws are subject to modification and interpretation by the applicable local governmental authorities 
we cannot predict the impact of any future modifications to or strict enforcement of the existing laws 
in addition  the termination or material modification of any of our agreements with the prc quasi government agencies could have a material adverse impact on our revenues and earnings 
we are exposed to political  economic and other risks that arise from operating a multinational business 
we have significant operations outside the united states 
we currently have operations in hong kong  the prc  canada  the united kingdom  france and germany 
further  we obtain raw materials  components and finished goods from foreign suppliers 
accordingly  our business is subject to the political  economic and other risks that are inherent in operating in foreign countries 
these risks include o the difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems  o trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements  o the imposition of tariffs  exchange controls or other restrictions  o difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations and the application of foreign labor regulations  o required compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations  and o changes in the general political and economic conditions in the countries where we operate  particularly in emerging markets 
our business success depends in part on our ability to successfully anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks 
no assurance can be given that such risks will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
political and economic uncertainties in the prc could affect our business 
our business could be adversely affected by the imposition in the prc of austerity measures intended to reduce inflation  which could result in the inadequate development or maintenance of infrastructure  the unavailability of adequate power and water supplies  transportation  raw material and parts  or a deterioration of the general political  economic or social environment in the prc 
relocation time and expenses could result in substantial losses 
if we determine it is necessary to relocate our manufacturing facilities from the prc  due to confiscation  expropriation  nationalization  embargoes  or other governmental restrictions  we would incur substantial operating and capital losses including losses resulting from business interruption and delays in production 
in addition  as a result of a relocation of our manufacturing equipment and other assets  we may incur relatively higher manufacturing costs  which could reduce sales and decrease the current margin on the products we previously manufactured in the prc 
relocation of our manufacturing operations would also result in disruption in the delivery of our products  which could  in turn  reduce demand for our products in the future 
we are dependent on certain large customers 
in fiscal  we had three customers wal mart  walgreens and kodak each of whose purchases represented in excess of of our total net sales and whose purchases in the aggregate represented over of our total net sales 
the loss of any of our large customers could have a material adverse impact on our revenues and profits 
digital camera products are subject to rapid technological changes  price erosion and obsolescence 
digital camera products are subject to rapid technological changes  price erosion and obsolescence to a greater extent than traditional and single use camera products 
because of rapid technological changes  some of our digital camera products became obsolete and  consequently  we recorded significant lower of cost or market value adjustments related to digital inventory during fiscal average selling prices for our products decline over relatively short time periods 
many of our manufacturing costs are fixed 
when our average selling prices decline  our revenues decline unless we sell more units  and our gross margins decline unless we are able to reduce our product costs by a commensurate amount 
our operating results suffer when gross margins decline 
to be successful in the development  manufacture and sale of digital camera products  we have to react quickly to technological advances and manage our inventory effectively to accommodate price competition and the short life span of such products 
our digital camera products involve a more complex development process  which we may not be able to successfully integrate into our operations  and we are dependent upon the continued availability of products and key components 
digital cameras involve a more complex development process and component procurement process than our traditional and single use cameras 
manufacturing delays  including component procurement delays or shortages and the timely introduction and delivery of new components and products  which may be outside our control  could adversely impact our business  results of operations and financial condition 
any disruption in the availability of key components or our suppliers ability to deliver quality components and products in time to meet critical manufacturing and distribution schedules could negatively impact our ability to achieve our growth and sales objectives 
we may occasionally experience a short supply of certain component parts as a result of strong demand in the industry for those parts or problems experienced by suppliers 
if shortages or delays persist  the price of these components may increase  we may be exposed to product quality issues or the components may not be available at all 
we may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build new products in a timely manner in the quantities needed 
accordingly  our revenue and gross margins and market share could suffer until other sources can be developed 
we are exposed to risks associated with intellectual property used in image capture devices 
image capture devices use technology which may be protected by united states or foreign patents 
the right to use such intellectual property is subject to the availability of licenses from the patent holders 
if licenses are not available or are only available on onerous terms  the company s business could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  the defense of patent infringement claims could be time consuming and costly 
from time to time the company receives patent infringement claims which it analyzes and  if appropriate  may either take action to avoid infringement or negotiate a license 
in at least two such cases  one of which involves one of the company s largest customers  the company is engaged in discussions looking toward licensing of certain digital image capture technology 
we face a risk of business interruption as a result of political events in hong kong and the prc 
we conduct a substantial part of our business in hong kong and the prc  such as manufacturing  administration  sales  engineering and design 
in july  the exercise of sovereignty over hong kong was transferred from the united kingdom to the prc and hong kong became a special administrative region of the prc 
we cannot predict how the prc will interpret and implement the basic law that provides  in part  for the capitalist system and way of life to remain unchanged for years 
we also cannot predict the effect of any such action on our business activities in hong kong or the prc  or on our operations or financial condition in general 
any significant changes affecting our operations or financial condition in hong kong or the prc could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
we are exposed to credit risk associated with sales to our customers 
the company sells a significant number of its products to a relatively small number of customers 
receivables arising from these sales are generally not collateralized 
the company monitors the credit worthiness of its customers and reviews outstanding receivable balances for collectibility on a regular basis and records provisions for doubtful accounts as necessary 
in the past we have had customers file for protection from their creditors under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
as a result  we have recognized provisions related to accounts receivable and inventory 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations above 
we are dependent on a small group of key personnel 
our business is managed by a small number of key management and operating personnel 
in particular  we rely on the continued services of ira b 
lampert  our chairman  chief executive officer and president 
the loss of his or any other key employee services could have a material adverse impact on our business 
we believe our future success will depend in large part on our continued ability to attract highly skilled and qualified personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense 
we may not be able to hire the necessary personnel to implement our business strategy  or we may need to pay higher compensation for employees than currently budgeted 
our inability to attract and retain such personnel could limit our growth and affect our profits 
the camera and photographic products industry is highly competitive 
as a manufacturer and distributor of low cost  popularly priced image capture products  we encounter substantial competition from a number of firms  many of which have longer operating histories  more established markets  more extensive facilities and  in some cases  greater resources 
to achieve our operating and financial objectives  we must manage our anticipated growth effectively 
we anticipate that our business will continue to grow 
our future success depends in large part on our ability to manage our anticipated growth 
to manage this growth  we will need to hire additional experienced  skilled personnel and to train  manage and retain key employees 
these activities may strain our management resources 
if we were unable to manage growth effectively  our profits would be adversely affected 
we face certain foreign currency risks as a result of conducting a substantial portion of our business activities in hong kong and the prc 
since and the hong kong dollar and the prc renminbi  respectively  have been pegged to the united states dollar  but the exchange rate of these currencies may fluctuate in the future 
although our dms and major retail business is conducted in us dollars  certain of our obligations under agreements in the prc and with our hong kong suppliers are paid in hong kong dollars and prc renminbi 
there is increasing international pressure on the prc to appreciate its currency 
we are also exposed to currency risks in japan and other countries where we purchase materials for our products or sell those products 
if there is a significant devaluation of the currency in a specific country  the prices of our products will increase relative to that country s currency and our products may be less competitive in that country 
also  if our international customers become unwilling to place orders denominated in us dollars  our revenue and operating results will be subject to foreign exchange fluctuations 
we generally do not engage in currency hedging activities 
we are unable to predict the effect of terrorist acts on commerce 
terrorist attacks in new york and washington  dc in september of have disrupted commerce throughout the united states and other parts of the world 
the continued threat of terrorism within the united states and abroad and the potential for continued military action and heightened security measures in response to such threat may cause significant disruption to commerce throughout the world 
to the extent that such disruptions result in delays or cancellations of customer orders  a general decrease in consumer spending  or our inability to effectively market and sell our products  our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
we are unable to predict whether the threat of terrorism or the responses thereto will result in any long term commercial disruptions or if such activities or responses will have a long term material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
our future tax rates could increase 
a number of factors will affect our tax rate in the future  and the combined effect of these factors could result in an increase in our effective tax rate as compared to our effective tax rate in fiscal this would adversely affect our net income 
we operate in different countries that have different income tax rates 
based upon our apportionment of income  our effective tax rate could fluctuate 
a key factor that could cause our tax rate to increase would be increasing the valuation allowance offsetting part  or all  of our net deferred tax assets 
changes in tax laws in the united states may further limit our ability to utilize our net operating losses 
any further limitation on our ability to utilize our net operating losses could adversely affect our operating results 
the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system presents certain risks 
in july  we began implementing a new enterprise resource planning  or erp  system which will become an important element of the company s accounting  financial and operating functions 
there are significant costs associated with implementing the new erp system  in terms of both financial outlay and the human resources to be incurred and expended in connection with its implementation 
in addition  there are certain risks associated with the related conversion to a new computer system  including a potential disruption in our accounting and operational controls and the possibility of problems associated with the conversion of electronic data 
if these issues are not properly and adequately addressed  it could result in the diversion of management s and other personnel s attention and resources  and could materially adversely affect our operating results and impact our ability to manage our business and anticipated growth 
the importation of products into the united states and other countries in which our products are sold is subject to various other risks 
the united states  the prc  hong kong  the european union or other countries may impose trade restrictions that could adversely affect our operations 
in addition  the united states is currently monitoring various prc practices  including trade  investment and government procurement  as well as the prc s compliance with various multilateral and bilateral agreements 
we cannot predict whether the united states will take future trade actions against the prc that may result in increased tariffs against prc products  including products imported by us 
our operations may be impaired as a result of disasters  business interruptions or similar events  including the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome 
disasters such as earthquakes  water  fire  electricity failure  or accidents affecting our operating activities  major facilities  and employees customers health could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
in particular  our operations in the prc  as well as most of our third party manufacturers and service providers involved in the manufacturing of our products  are located within a relatively close proximity of one another in the prc 
therefore  any disaster that strikes within close proximity of that geographic area could be exceedingly disruptive to our business and could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
we do not currently have a disaster recovery plan 
in the event of another outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome  or sars  our facilities and or the facilities of our third party manufacturers and service providers located in hong kong  the prc and other parts of southeast asia could be quarantined or temporarily closed 
if this occurs  it could delay or prevent us from developing new products or manufacturing  testing or shipping our current products  and may require us to find other providers of such services  which may be unavailable or more expensive 
further  if a sars outbreak has an adverse impact on the businesses of our customers  it could reduce the size and or frequency of our customers purchases  which could adversely impact our operating results 
we may not be able to identify and integrate future acquisitions 
we intend to pursue strategic acquisitions that we consider reasonable in light of the revenues and profits we believe we will be able to generate from these acquisitions 
the cost of acquisitions within the industry has generally increased over time 
additionally  we compete for acquisitions with certain other industry competitors  some of which have greater financial and other resources than we do 
increased demand for acquisitions may result in fewer acquisition opportunities for us as well as higher acquisition prices 
although we believe opportunities may exist for us to grow through acquisitions  we may not be able to identify and consummate acquisitions on acceptable terms 
if we do acquire other companies  we may not be able to profitably manage and successfully integrate them with our operations and sales and marketing efforts without substantial costs or delays 
acquisitions involve a number of potential risks  including the potential loss of customers  increased leverage and debt service requirements  combining disparate company cultures and facilities and operating in geographically diverse markets 
one or more of our future acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the market price of our common stock may fluctuate 
the stock markets  and in particular the nasdaq national market  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices of equity securities of many companies and that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of such companies 
these broad market factors may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against that company 
such a lawsuit has been instituted against us and could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources  which could harm our business 
see legal proceedings 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a result of our global operating and financial activities  we are exposed to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates that may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 
in seeking to minimize the risks and or costs associated with such activities  we manage exposures to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates through our regular operating and financing activities 
at june   our exposure to changes in interest rates was minimal  since we had no long term or short term debt outstanding 
since we have no debt outstanding  we do not deem interest rate risk to be significant or material to our financial position or results of operations 
we do not presently use derivative instruments to adjust our interest rate risk profile 
we do not utilize financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes  nor do we utilize leveraged financial instruments 
each of our foreign subsidiaries purchases their inventories in us dollars and certain of their sales are in foreign currency  thereby creating an exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we purchase certain components  raw materials and services needed to manufacture our products in foreign currencies including japanese yen 
the impact of foreign exchange transactions is reflected in our statements of operations 
as of june   we were not engaged in any hedging activities and we had no forward exchange contracts outstanding 
we continue to analyze the benefits and costs associated with hedging against foreign currency fluctuations
