item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report  specifically  in connection with note to our consolidated financial statements  entitled reportable segments 
critical accounting policies and estimates certain amounts included in or affecting our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated  requiring us to make certain assumptions with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time the financial statements are prepared 
the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect o the amounts we report for assets and liabilities  o our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and o the amounts we report for revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
therefore  the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and associated disclosures with respect to contingent assets and obligations are necessarily affected by these estimates 
we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis  utilizing historical experience  consultation with experts and other methods we consider reasonable in the particular circumstances 
nevertheless  actual results may differ significantly from our estimates 
any effects on our business  financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
in preparing our financial statements and related disclosures  we must use estimates in determining the economic useful lives of our assets  the fair values used to determine possible asset impairment charges  provisions for uncollectible accounts receivable  exposures under contractual indemnifications and various other recorded or disclosed amounts 
however  we believe that certain accounting policies are of more significance in our financial statement preparation process than others 
with respect to our environmental exposure  we utilize both internal staff and external experts to assist us in identifying environmental issues and in estimating the costs and timing of remediation efforts 
often  as the remediation evaluation and effort progresses  additional information is obtained  requiring revisions to estimated costs 
these revisions are reflected in our income in the period in which they are reasonably determinable 
in december  after a thorough review of any potential environmental issues that could impact our assets or operations and of our need to correctly record all related environmental contingencies  we recognized a million non recurring reduction in environmental expense and in our overall accrued environmental liability  and we included this amount within other  net in the accompanying consolidated statement of income for the million income item resulted from the necessity of properly adjusting and realigning our environmental expenses and accrued liabilities between our reportable business segments  specifically between our products pipelines and our terminals busines s segments 
the million reduction in environmental expense resulted in a million non recurring loss to our products pipelines business segment and a million non recurring gain to our terminals business segment 
with respect to legal proceedings  we are subject to litigation and regulatory proceedings as the result of our business operations and transactions 
we utilize both internal and external counsel in evaluating our potential exposure to adverse outcomes from orders  judgments or settlements 
t o the extent that actual outcomes differ from our estimates  or additional facts and circumstances cause us to revise our estimates  our earnings will be affected 
in general  we expense legal costs as incurred 
when we identify specific litigation that is expected to continue for a significant period of time and require substantial expenditures  we identify a range of possible costs expected to be required to litigate the matter to a conclusion or reach an acceptable settlement 
if no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount  we record a liability equal to the low end of the range 
any such liability recorded is revised as better information becomes available 
in addition  effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
eliminates the amortization of goodwill  requires annual impairment testing of goodwill and introduces the concept of indefinite life intangible assets 
th e new rules also prohibit the amortization of goodwill associated with business combinations that close after june  these new requirements will impact future period net income by an amount equal to the discontinued goodwill amortization offset by goodwill impairment charges  if any  and adjusted for any differences between the old and new rules for defining intangible assets on future business combinations 
an initial impairment test was required in as of january  we completed this initial transition impairment test in june and determined that our goodwil l was not impaired as of january  finally  regarding our pension disclosures  we are required to make assumptions and estimates regarding the accuracy of our pension investment returns 
specifically  these include o our investment return assumptions  o the significant estimates on which those assumptions are based  and o the potential impact that changes in those assumptions could have on our reported results of operations and cash flows 
we consider our overall pension liability exposure to be minimal in relation to the value of our total consolidated assets and net income 
however  in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  a component of our net periodic pension cost includes the return on pension plan assets  including both realized and unrealized changes in the fair market value of pension plan assets 
a source of volatility in pension costs comes from this inclusion of unrealized or market value gains and losses on pension assets as part of the components recognized as pension expense 
to prevent wide swings in pension expense from occurring because of one time changes in fund values  sfas no 
allows for the use of an actuarial computed expected value of plan asset gain s or losses to be the actual element included in the determination of pension expense 
the actuarial derived expected return on pension assets not only employs an expected rate of return on plan assets  but also assumes a market related value of plan assets  which is a calculated value that recognize s changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over not more than five years 
as required  we disclose the weighted average expected long run rat e of return on our plan assets  which is used to calculate our plan assets expected return 
for more information on our pension disclosures  see note t o our consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this report 
results of operations in  we managed to again achieve record levels of revenues  operating income  net income and earnings per unit 
the fiscal year ended december  marked the fifth successive year that we have improved on all four of thes e operating measures since the change in control of our general partner in february we owe our success primarily to the continuing execution of the same strategy adopted by management in o providing  for a fee  transportation  storage and handling services which are core to the energy infrastructure of growing markets  o increasing utilization of assets while containing costs  o leveraging economies of scale from incremental acquisitions and expansions  and o maximizing the benefits of our financial structure 
in  our net income was million per diluted unit on revenues of  million  compared to net income of million per diluted unit on revenues of  million in  and net income of million per diluted unit on revenues of million in our total consolidated operating income was million in  million in and million in operating expenses  excluding depreciation  depletion and amortization  general and administrative expenses and taxes  other than income taxes  were  million in  compared wit h  million in and million in the increases in overall revenues  expenses and net income in compared to were attributable to both solid internal growth and contributions from acquired assets  especially from our acquisition of kinder morgan tejas  formerly tejas gas  llc  on january  each of our four business segment s reported increased earnings in over the increases in overall revenues  expenses and income in compared to resulted mainly from assets and businesses that we acquired from gatx corporation in the first quarter of  from kmi on december   and from other acquisitions mad e during as well as internal growth from existing assets 
in addition  in  just as in  each business segment reported increased earnings over the prior year 
equity earnings  from our investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting  were million in  million in and million in these amounts represent equity earnings net of expense from allowable amortization of excess investment costs 
additionally  we declared a record cash distribution of per unit for the fourth quarter of an annualized rate of 
our distribution for the fourth quarter of was higher than the per unit distribution we made for the fourth quarter of  and higher than the per unit distribution we made for the fourth quarter of products pipelines our products pipelines segment reported earnings of million on revenues of million in this compared to earnings of million on revenues of million in and earnings of million on revenue s of million in operating expenses  excluding depreciation and taxes other than income taxes  were million  million and million for each of the three years ended december   and  respectively 
the million overall increase in segment earnings in over includes the million non recurring loss from the adjustmen t and realignment of our environmental liabilities referred to above in our critical accounting policies and estimates 
excluding the non recurring environmental loss  segment earnings were million in the increase in segment earnings in over the prior year was primarily related to the strong year to year results reported from our calnev pipeline operations  our ownership interest in the cochin pipeline system and our pacific operations 
the year to year million decrease in segment revenues and the million decrease in segment expenses  include reductions of million in transmix revenues and million in transmix expenses  both resulting from our long term transmix processing agreement with duke energy merchants 
during the first quarter of  we entered into a year agreemen t with duke energy merchants to process transmix on a fee basis only 
under the agreement  duke energy merchants is responsible for procurement of the transmix and sale of the products after processing 
this agreement allows us to eliminat e commodity price exposure in our transmix operations 
partially offsetting the overall decrease in segment revenues was a million increase in revenues earned from our calnev pipeline  the result of an almost increase in average pipeline tariff rates in and the inclusion  in  of a full year of operations versus nine months in our proportionate share of revenues from the cochin pipeline system increased million in compared to  the increase resulting from higher volumes an d tariffs as well as our additional ownership interest 
our pacific operations reported a million increase in revenues in compared to although mainline delivery volumes remained flat in  compared to the prior year  overall revenues were higher due to a increase in average pipeline tariff rates and higher non transportation revenues 
for all products pipelines owned or operated at both december  and  total throughput delivery of refined petroleum products  consisting of gasoline  diesel fuel and jet fuel  was up in over gasoline delivery volumes were up in  compared to nationally 
although ou r total jet fuel delivery volumes were down for  reflecting the effects of the september  terrorist attacks  deliveries of jet fuel improved steadily throughout the year 
excluding the million decrease in our transmix cost of sales expense referred to above  the segment s overall expenses remained relatively flat during excluding depreciation and taxes  other than income taxes  expense s related to cochin increased a slight million  due to the increase in delivery volumes and our additional ownership interest 
the million increase in segment earnings in compared to was mainly attributable to acquisitions we made since december and to cost savings resulting from our assumption of the operating duties of plantation pip e line company on december  the million increase in revenue s for compared to was primarily the result of an incremental million in revenues from acquisitions made since the fourth quarter of  million in operating reimbursements from plantation  and a million improvement in our pacific operations revenues  primarily resulting from a increase in mainline delivery volumes and an over increase in average tariff rates 
acquisitions made since the fourth quarter of  which contributed to our segment s results in include o kinder morgan transmix company  llc  o the remaining interest in the colton transmix processing facility  o a interest in the cochin pipeline system in january  we acquired an additional ownership interest  which was made effective december   bringing our total interest to  and o assets acquired from gatx corporation  consisting of central florida pipeline llc  calnev pipe line llc and petroleum product and chemical terminals 
the segment s overall increase in revenues was partially offset by a million decrease in transmix revenues  the result of entering into our long ter m transmix processing agreement with duke energy merchants during the first quarter of  as referred to above 
the million increase in expenses  excluding depreciation and taxes  other than income taxes  for our products pipelines segment in compared to  resulted primarily from ou r acquisitions  costs incurred under our operations agreement with plantation and higher fuel and power expenses on our pacific operations pipelines 
this increase was partially offset by a reduction in transmix expenses due to our agreement with duke energy merchants 
operating income for each of the three years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
earnings from our products pipelines equity investments  net of amortization o f excess costs  were million in  million in and million in the million increase in net equity earnings in versus was due to a million decrease in expenses from the amortizatio n of excess investment costs and a million increase in equity earnings  both related to our ownership interest in plantation pipe line company 
effectiv e january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets and ceased amortizing the amount of our equity investment costs that exceeded the underlying fair value of net assets 
the increase in our proportionate share of plantation s earnings in resulted from plantation s higher revenues and lower operating and interest expenses 
the higher revenues resulted from record delivery volumes  the lower operating expenses resulted from lower power costs and the lower interest expenses resulted from lower average borrowing rates 
the million decrease in the segment s equity earnings in versus was due to lower equity earnings from plantation pipe line company as a result of lower throughput and to the absence of equity earnings from our colton transmix processing facility during on december   we acquired the remainin g ownership interest in the facility and since that date  we have included colton s operational results in our consolidated financial statements 
sfpp  lp is the subsidiary limited partnership that owns our pacific operations  excluding calnev pipe line llc and related terminals acquired from gatx corporation 
tariffs charged by sfpp are subject to certain proceedings at the federal energy regulatory commission involving shippers complaints regarding the interstate rates  as well as practices and the jurisdictional nature of certain facilities and services  on our pacific operations pipeline systems 
generally  the interstate rates on our pacific operations pipeline systems are grandfathered under the energy policy act of unless substantially changed circumstances are found to exist 
to the extent substantially changed circumstances are found to exist  our pacific operation s may be subject to substantial exposure under these ferc complaints 
we currentl y believe that these ferc complaints seek approximately million in tariff reparations and prospective annual tariff reductions  the aggregate average annual impact of which would be approximately million 
however  even if substantially changed circumstances are found to exist  we believe that the resolution of these ferc complaints will be for amounts substantially less than the amounts sought 
natural gas pipelines our natural gas pipelines segment reported earnings of million on revenues of  million in in  the segment reported earnings of million on revenues of  million  and in  reported earnings of million on revenues of million 
expenses  excluding depreciation charges and taxes  other than income taxes  were  million   million and million for each of the three years ended december   and  respectively 
the segment s significant million increase in year to year earnings and its  million increase in year to year revenues in versus relate primarily to our january acquisition of kinder morgan tejas 
kinder morgan tejas operations includ e a  mile intrastate natural gas pipeline system that has good access to natural gas supply basins in texas 
the acquisition and subsequent integration of its assets with our pre existing natural gas pipeline assets in the state of texas  particularly our kinder morgan texas pipeline system  has produced a strategic and complementary intrastate pipeline business combination 
both kinder morgan tejas and kmtp  which together comprise our texas intrastate natural gas group  purchase and sell significant volumes of natural gas  which is transported through their pipeline systems 
our objective is to match every purchase and sale  thus locking in the equivalent of a transportation fee 
the purchase and sale activity results in considerably higher revenues and operating expenses compared to the interstate natural gas pipeline systems of kinder morgan interstate gas transmission and trailblazer pipeline company  which we acquired on december  from kmi 
both kmigt and trailblazer charge a transportation fee for gas transmission service but neither system has significant gas purchases and resales 
together  in  the combination of our two intrastate natural gas pipeline systems earned million  generated revenues of  million and incurred  million in expenses  excluding depreciation and taxes  other than income taxes 
in  kmtp alone had million in earnings   million in revenues and  million in expenses 
year over year operating results from our trailblazer pipeline company also contributed to the segment s increase in earnings and revenues in in may  we completed a million expansion project that increased transportation capacity on the pipeline by approximately 
as a result  trailblazer realized a increase in natural gas transportation volumes in compared to the overall increase in segment revenues in compared to was partially offset by a million decrease in revenues earned by our casper and douglas natural gas gathering and processing system  and by a million decrease in revenues earned by kmigt 
casper and douglas revenue decrease was primarily related to a general decline in natural gas prices in and around the rocky mountain region since the end of the third quarter of  and kmigt s revenue decrease was mainly the result of lower operational gas sales and lower fuel recovery rates in the  million increase in segment expenses  excluding depreciation and taxes  other than income taxes  in over was mainly due to our kinder morgan tejas acquisition  but the overall increase was partially offset by a million decrease in expenses incurred by casper and douglas  related to the decrease in natural gas prices 
the segment s million increase and  million increase in year to year earnings and revenues in over relate primarily to the inclusion of assets that we acquired from kmi on december   and to a strong performance from our pre existing assets 
effective on december   we acquired from kmi o kinder morgan texas pipeline  lp  o our casper and douglas natural gas gathering and processing systems  o a interest in coyote gas treating  llc  and o a interest in thunder creek gas services  llc 
combined  kmtp and the casper and douglas systems earned million  produced operating revenues of  million and incurred expenses  excludin g depreciation and taxes  other than income taxes  of  million in the segment s overall increase in revenues in over also resulted from a million increase in revenues earned by kmigt  mainly due to higher fuel recovery revenues  driven by a reduction in fuel losses 
the overall increase in segment expenses was partially offset by lower expenses on the trailblazer pipeline  primarily the result of favorable system imbalance settlements 
operating income for each of the three years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
we account for the segment s investments in red cedar gas gathering company  coyot e gas treating  llc and thunder creek gas services  llc under the equity method o f accounting 
earnings from these equity investments  net of amortization of excess costs  were million in  million in and million in the million increase in over resulted primarily from a million increase in earnings from our interest in red cedar  mainly due to a million decrease in amortization of excess investment costs related to our adoption of sfas no 
the million increase in over resulted from the inclusion of million of net equity earnings from our investments in coyote and thunder creek and a million increase in earnings from our investment in red cedar  primarily the result of higher revenues from custom compression projects 
co pipelines our co pipelines segment consists of kinder morgan co company  lp and it s consolidated affiliates 
in  our co pipelines segment reported earnings o f million on revenues of million 
this compared to earnings of million on revenues of million in expenses  excluding depreciation depletion  amortization  and taxes  other than income taxes  totaled million in versus million in the million increase i n year to year earnings was primarily attributable to the million increase in revenues  partially offset by higher depreciation  depletion and operating expenses 
the increase in revenues was driven by higher oil productio n volumes produced at the segment s sacroc unit  as well as higher carbon dioxide pipeline delivery volumes 
oil production at sacroc  located in the permian basin of west texas  increased in compared to delivery volumes o f carbon dioxide  including deliveries on our central basin pipeline and our majority owned canyon reef carriers pipeline increased in offsetting the revenue increase was an million increase in non cash depreciation and depletion charges and a million increase in operating and maintenance expenses  both of which related to the higher oil production volumes 
depreciation and depletion charges were also up in compared to  primarily as a result of the capital expenditures we made since the end of and a change to a higher unit of production depletion rat e on january  the segment reported operating income of million in and million in earnings from equity investments  net of amortization of exces s costs  were million in  compared to million in the million increase resulted from higher earnings from the segment s ownership interest in cortez pipeline company  mainly due to lower average debt balances and lower average borrowing rates  partially offset by slightly lower carbon dioxide delivery volumes 
prior to april   we owned of kinder morgan co company  lp  formerly shell co company  lp  and we accounted for our investment under the equity method of accounting 
after our acquisition of the remaining ownership interest on april   we included the company s financial result s in our consolidated financial statements 
therefore  the segment s results consist primarily of o one quarter of equity earnings from our original interest in kinde r morgan co company  lp  o nine months of operations from pre existing assets owned by the partnership  including its ownership interest in cortez pipeline company  and o seven months of operations from significant carbon dioxide pipeline assets and oil producing property interests that were acquired from devon energy on june  for the year  our co pipelines segment reported million of earnings  million of expenses  excluding depreciation  depletion  amortization and taxes  other than income taxes  and million of revenues 
operating income totaled million and equity earnings  net of amortization of excess costs  totaled million  representing the million from our interest in kinder morgan co company  lp and million from the segment s interest in cortez pipeline company 
terminals our terminals segment includes the business portfolio of approximately terminals that transload and store coal  dry bulk materials and petrochemical related liquids  as well as more than transload operations in states 
the segment reported earnings of million on revenues of million in this compared to earnings of million on revenues of million in and earnings of million on revenues of million in expenses  excluding depreciation and taxes  other than income taxes  for each of the three years ended december   and  were million  million and million  respectively 
operating incom e for each of the three years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
the million increase in segment earnings in over includes the million non recurring gain from the adjustment and realignment of our environmental liabilities referred to above in our critical accounting policies and estimates 
excluding the non recurring environmental item mentioned in the immediately preceding paragraph  segment earnings totaled million in most of the growth in segment earnings and revenues in compared to was driven by the acquisitions and asset purchases that we have made since the last half o f  as well as internal growth 
these investments accounted for million of segment earnings growth in internal growth at existing facilities  primarily driven by expansion projects at various terminals  accounted for million of segment earnings growth in over our acquisitions and additions included o the terminal businesses we acquired from koninklijke vopak nv  effective july   o the terminal businesses we acquired from the boswell oil company  effective august   o the terminal businesses we acquired from an affiliate of stolt nielsen  inc in november  o kinder morgan materials services llc  formerly laser materials services llc  acquired effective january   o a interest in international marine terminals partnership a interest acquired effective january  and an additional interest acquired effective february   o the milwaukee bagging operations  acquired effective may   o the owensboro gateway terminal  acquired effective september   o the st 
gabriel terminal  acquired effective september   and o the purchase of four floating cranes at our bulk terminal facility in port sulphur  louisiana in december in compared to  the acquisitions listed above accounted for incremental amounts of million in earnings  million in revenues and million in expenses  excluding depreciation and taxes  other than income taxes 
expansion projects undertaken during at our carteret terminal in ne w york harbor and at our pasadena terminal on the houston  texas ship channel contributed to an almost increase in the segment s leaseable capacity of liquids products 
in addition  while adding the incremental capacity during  we maintained a strong liquids capacity utilization rate of  the same level reached in declines in engineering services and in the volume of transloaded bulk products partially offset the overall increases in segment earnings and revenues in including all bulk terminals owned at december   transloading of bulk tonnage decreased in compared to the decline was primarily due to lower terminal transfers of petroleum coke  salt tonnage and other dry bulk materials 
volumes of coal handled at our bulk terminals are expected to continue to decline in due to the fact that we will no longer operate the laxt coal terminal after the first quarter of and to the opening of competing terminals during in the geographic regions served by our cora and grand rivers coal terminals 
volumes at cora and grand rivers are expected to decline by approximately million tons in comparing to  the year to year increases in our terminals revenues  expenses and earnings were driven principally by the strategic acquisitions we have made since the end of in addition to the investments listed above  these acquisitions include o delta terminal services llc  acquired effective december   o kinder morgan liquids terminals llc  acquired from gatx corporation effective january   and o pinney dock transport llc  acquired effective march  in compared to  the acquisitions and investments we made since the end of accounted for incremental amounts of million in earnings  million in revenues and million in expenses  excluding depreciatio n and taxes  other than income taxes 
on an aggregate basis  bulk tonnage transfe r volumes  including coal and all other bulk materials  increased in ove r levels 
our transfers of liquids volumes  including refined petroleum products  chemicals and all other liquids volumes increased in compared with when the liquids terminals were owned by other entities 
the increase in expenses over was the result of acquisitions made in and higher maintenance and operating expenses associated with the transfer of highe r volumes 
other items not attributable to any segment include general and administrative expenses  interest income and expense and minority interest 
general and administrative expenses totaled million in  compared to million in and million in the million increase in general and administrative expenses in compared to the prior year was primarily due to additional employee benefit  compensation and reimbursement charges  higher insurance related expenses and administrative expenses related to our kinder morgan tejas acquisition 
the year to year increase in our genera l and administrative expenses in compared to was mainly due to our larger and more diverse operations 
during  we incorporated pipeline and terminal businesses that we acquired from gatx corporation  incorporated additional natural gas pipeline assets that we acquired from kmi on december and operated plantation pipe line company for a full year 
we continue to manage aggressively our infrastructure expense and to focus on our productivity and expense controls 
our total interest expense  net of interest income  was million in  million in and million in the slight million increase in net interest items in compared to reflects higher average borrowings during due to our acquisition and expansion projects 
the change in net financing charges was partially offset by a decrease in average borrowing rates that have occurred since the end of in  we issued billion in principal amount of senior notes and we retired a maturing amount of million in principal amount of senior notes 
in march  we closed a public offering of billion in principal amount of senior notes 
the increase was primarily due to the additional debt we issued related to the financing of the acquisitions that we have made since the end of and to the million in third party debt we assumed as part of the assets acquired from gatx corporation 
minority interest  which includes the general partner interest in ou r five operating limited partnerships  totaled million in  compared to million in and million in the million decrease in from resulted primarily from our acquisition of an additional ownership interest in trailblazer pipeline company 
in may  we acquired th e remaining ownership interest in trailblazer that we did not already own thereby eliminating the minority interest relating to trailblazer pipeline company 
the million increase in minority interest in over resulted from earnings attributable to midtex gas storage company  lp  a partnership controlled by kinder morgan texas pipeline lp as well as to our higher overall income 
outlook we actively pursue a strategy to increase our operating income 
we will use a three pronged approach to accomplish this goal 
o cost reductions 
we have reduced the total operating  maintenance  general and administrative expenses of those operations that we owned at the time kinder morgan delaware  inc acquired our general partner in february in addition  we have made similar reductions in the operating  maintenance  general and administrative expenses of many of the businesses and assets that we acquired or have assumed operations of since february  including our pacific operations  plantation pipe line company  the businesses we acquired from gatx corporation and kinder morgan tejas 
generally  these reductions in expense have been achieved by eliminating duplicative functions that we and the acquired businesses each maintained prior to their combination 
we intend to continue to seek further reductions throughout our businesses where appropriate 
o internal growth 
we intend to grow income from our current assets through a increased utilization  and b internal expansion projects 
we operate classic fixed cost businesses with little variable costs 
by controlling these variable costs  any increase in utilization of our pipelines and terminals generally results in an increase in income 
increases in utilization are principally driven by increases in demand for gasoline  je t fuel  natural gas and other energy products that we transport and or handle 
increases in demand for these products are typically driven by demographic growth in markets we serve  including the rapidly growing western and southeastern united states 
in addition  we have undertaken a number of expansion projects that management believes will also increase revenues from existing operations  including the following o a million investment project to expand our carbon dioxide business 
the project includes the construction of the new million centerline pipeline that will originate near denver city  texas  and transport carbon dioxide to the snyder  texas area 
the pipeline will consist of miles of inch pipe and will primarily supply the sacroc unit in the permian basin of west texas  but will also be available for existing and prospective third party carbon dioxide projects in the horseshoe atoll area of the permian basin 
construction is expected to be completed by mid the project also includes the spending of approximately million to add additional infrastructure  including wells  injection and compression facilities  to support the expanding carbon dioxide flooding operations at the sacroc unit 
based on positive response  by the end of  we committed an additional million to develop sacroc 
these expenditures are expected to quadruple carbon dioxide deliveries to the sacroc unit and triple oil production when compared to levels of million cubic feet per day of carbon dioxide and  barrels per day of crude oil  o a million expansion project on the trailblazer pipeline 
the expansion project began in august and was completed in may the expansion project increased transportation capacity on the pipeline by to  dekatherms per day of natural gas  and the increase has already been fully subscribed by customers 
the project included installing two new compressor stations and adding  additional horsepower at an existing compressor station  o a million investment in our growing terminals business 
the investment includes storage expansion and upgrade projects at our liquids terminals located in carteret  new jersey  pasadena  texas and dravosburg  pennsylvania 
the major expansion work is taking place at carteret and pasadena  and will follow the expansions that were initiated there in at carteret  in the new york harbor area  this expansion project will add an additional  barrels of petroleum storage capacity and will include the construction of a new inch pipeline that will connect to the buckeye pipeline system  a major products pipeline serving the east coast 
the expansion work at our carteret terminal is expected to be completed in the third quarter of at pasadena  on the houston ship channel  the expansion project will increase storage capacity by another  barrels of petroleum products and is expected to be completed in the second quarter of  o a million investment project that involves the construction of pipeline  compression and storage facilities to accommodate an additional billion cubic feet of natural gas storage capacity on kinder morgan interstate gas transmission llc s cheyenne market center 
the additional service has been fully subscribed under year contracts 
the cheyenne market center is a new service offering firm natural gas storage capabilities that will allow for the receipt  storage and subsequent re delivery of natural gas supplies at applicable points located in the vicinity of the cheyenne hub in weld county  colorado and our huntsman storage facility in cheyenne county  nebraska 
the cheyenne market center is expected to begin service during the summer of  o a million project to expand the capacity on a mile segment of the plantation pipe line system 
the project will entail replacing an existing eight inch pipeline between bremen  georgia and knoxville  tennessee with a new inch pipeline 
the expansion will double capacity on the segment of the pipeline to approximately  barrels per day of refined petroleum products 
construction will be initiated only after additional commitments from interested shippers are obtained  o a million investment in a storage expansion project at our liquids terminal located in perth amboy  new jersey 
the expansion includes the construction of an additional  barrels of storage and increases the petroleum capacity at the facility by more than 
the expansion accommodates a long term storage agreement that we entered into with a petroleum customer for storage services in the new york harbor area 
we expect to complete this expansion project by the end of  o a million investment in expansion projects at existing bulk terminal facilities in the investments include the purchase of four barge mounted crane units from stevedoring services of america for use at our international marine terminal located in port sulphur  louisiana  new storage facilities at several bulk terminal sites and continued marine improvements at our shipyard river terminal located in charleston  south carolina  and o an million investment project that involves the construction of the mile  inch mier monterrey natural gas pipeline that stretches from south texas to monterrey  mexico  one of mexico s fastest growing industrial areas 
the new pipeline will interconnect with the southern end of the kinder morgan texas pipeline system in starr county  texas  and is designed to initially transport up to  dekatherms per day of natural gas 
we have entered into year contract with pemex gas y petroquimica basica  which has subscribed all of the pipeline s capacity 
the pipeline will connect to a  megawatt power plant complex and to the pemex natural gas transportation system 
construction of the pipeline is expected to be completed during the second quarter of for more information related to the financing of our expansion activities  see liquidity and capital resources primary cash requirements 
o strategic acquisitions 
since january   we have made the following acquisitions o kinder morgan materials services llc  formerly laser materials services llc january  o interest in international marine terminals january  o additional interest in international marine terminals february   o kinder morgan tejas january   o milwaukee bagging operations bulk terminal assets may   o remaining interest in trailblazer pipeline company may   o owensboro gateway bulk terminal assets september   o ic terminal holdings company st 
gabriel terminal september   an d o mj rudolph bulk terminal assets january  the costs and methods of financing for each of these acquisitions are discussed under liquidity and capital resources capital requirements for recent transactions 
we regularly seek opportunities to make additional strategic acquisitions  t o expand existing businesses and to enter into related businesses 
we periodicall y consider potential acquisition opportunities as they are identified  but we cannot assure you that we will be able to consummate any such acquisition 
our management anticipates that we will finance acquisitions by borrowings under ou r bank credit facilities or by issuing commercial paper  and subsequently reduce these short term borrowings by issuing new long term debt securities  common units and or i units to kmr 
we are continuing to assess the effect of the terrorist attacks of september  on our businesses 
in response to the attacks  we have increased security at our assets 
we face the possibility that during  property insurance carriers generally may terminate insurance coverage for incidents of sabotage and terrorism or only offer it at prices that we believe are excessive recent federal legislation provides an insurance framework that should cause current insurers to continue to provide sabotage and terrorism coverage under standard property insurance policies 
nonetheless  there is no assurance that adequate sabotage and terrorism insurance will be available at reasonable rates throughout currently  we do not believe that the increased cost associate d with these measures will have a material effect on our operating results 
if demand for the products that we handle were to significantly decrease  ou r shippers would decrease the volumes that they ship through our systems or that we handle and store for them  which could have a negative impact on our financial performance 
as of december   we have not noticed a significant decrease in the volumes of product  other than jet fuel  that we ar e moving through our operations as a result of the september  attacks 
however  our deliveries of jet fuel showed steady improvement throughout in addition  recent federal legislation signed into law in december includes new guidelines for the us dot and pipeline companies in the areas of testing  education  training and communication 
the pipeline safety improvement act of provides a consistent set of guidelines for all operators to follow and requires the riskiest of products pipelines and natural gas pipelines i n the united states to be inspected within five years of the law s enactment 
the pipeline risk ratings are based on numerous factors  including the population density in the geographic regions served by a particular pipeline  as well as the age and condition of the pipeline and its protective coating 
the remaining of the natural gas pipelines must be inspected within ten years of the law s enactment 
the law requires pipelines to be re evaluated every seven years thereafter 
compliance with this legislation will increase our operating expenses in the future

summary of certain contractual obligations amount of commitment ex piration per period less than after total year years years years in thousand s commercial paper outstanding   sfpp first mortgage notes   other debt borrowings    operating leases    other obligations   total    primary cash requirements our primary cash requirements  in addition to normal operating expenses  are debt service  sustaining capital expenditures  expansion capital expenditures and quarterly distributions to our common unitholders  class b unitholders and general partner 
in addition to utilizing cash generated from operations  we could meet our cash requirements other than distributions to our common unitholders  class b unitholders and general partner through borrowings under our credit facilities  issuing short term commercial paper  long term notes or additional common units or issuing additional i units to kmr

as a publicly traded limited partnership  our common units are attractive primarily to individual investors 
individual investors represent a small segment of the total equity capital market 
we believe institutional investors prefer shares of kmr over our common units due to tax and other regulatory considerations 
thus  kmr makes purchases of i units issued by us with the proceeds from the sale of kmr shares to institutions 
the scheduled maturities of our outstanding debt  excluding market value of interest rate swaps  at december   are summarized as follows in thousands thereafter  total  of the million scheduled to mature in  we intend and have the ability to refinance the entire amount on a long term basis under our existing credit facilities 
accordingly  this amount has been classified as long term debt in our accompanying consolidated balance sheet at december  currently  we do not anticipate any liquidity problems 
at december   our current commitments for sustaining capital expenditures were approximately million 
this amount has been committed primarily for the purchase of plant and equipment and is based on the payments we expect to need for our sustaining capital expenditure plan 
all of our capital expenditures  with the exception of sustaining capital expenditures  ar e discretionary 
in addition  during the first quarter of  we will need approximately million to complete our acquisitions of assets from mj rudolph corporation an d stevedoring services of america

the acquisition als o includes the purchase of certain assets that provide stevedoring services at these locations 
for more information  see items and business and properties recent developments and note to our consolidated financial statements 
the purchase of assets from stevedoring services of america represents a barge mounted floating crane that we currently lease at our bulk terminal facility in port sulphur  louisiana 
we expect to fund the completion of these investments with borrowings under our commercial paper program 
some of our customers are experiencing severe financial problems that have had a significant impact on their creditworthiness 
we are working to implement to the extent allowable under applicable laws and regulations  prepayments and other security requirements such as letters of credit to enhance our credit position relating to amounts owed from these customers 
we cannot assure that one or more of our financially distressed customers will not default on their obligations to us or that such a default or defaults will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position or future results of operations 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million in versus million in the million increase in resulted mainly fro m a million increase in cash earnings  reflecting the strong performance and growth that occurred across our business portfolio during also contributing to the overall increase in cash provided by operating activities was a million increase relative to net changes in working capital items and a million increase in the amount of distributions we received from our equity investments 
the favorable working capital change was primarily the result of timing differences in the collection on and payments of our current accounts 
the increase in equity distributions related to higher distributions from our equity interest in plantation pipe line company and from our equity interest in coyote gas treating  llc 
the year to year overall increase in operating cash flows was partially reduced by higher payments made in under certain settlement agreements  primarily tariff related agreements betwee n shippers and our products pipelines  and environmental settlement agreements 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities was  million for the year ende d december   compared to  million for the prior year 
the million decrease in funds utilized in investing activities was mainly attributable to higher expenditures made for strategic acquisitions in outlays for acquisition of assets  new businesses and investments totaled million in  versus  million in our expenditures in included o million for kinder morgan tejas  o million for the remaining ownership interest in trailblazer pipeline company and a contingent interest in trailblazer from cig trailblazer gas company  o million on december for bulk terminal assets previously owned by mj rudolph corporation  and o million for an additional ownership interest in the cochin pipeline system  which was made effective december  our expenditures in included o million for the acquisition of gatx corporation s domestic pipeline s and terminals business  including kinder morgan liquids terminals llc  calnev pipe line llc and central florida pipeline llc  o million for km texas pipeline  lp  o million for liquids terminals acquired from an affiliate of stolt nielsen  inc  o million for bulk terminal llc s acquired from koninklijke vopak nv o million for pinney dock transport llc  and o million for bulk and liquids terminal assets acquired from the boswell oil company 
we continue to invest significantly in strategic acquisitions in order to fuel future growth and increase unitholder value 
partially offsetting the overall decline in funds used in investing activities in compared to was a million increase in funds used for capital expenditures and a million increase in contributions to equity investments 
including expansion and maintenance projects  our capital expenditures were a record million in we spent million for capital expenditures in the million increase was primarily due to continued investment in our natural gas pipelines  co pipelines and terminals business segments 
we continue to expand and grow our existing businesses and have current projects i n place that will significantly add storage and throughput capacity to our terminaling  natural gas transmission and carbon dioxide flooding operations 
our sustaining capital expenditures were million for  compared to million for the million increase in investment contributions was due to higher investments made to the natural gas gathering operations of thunder creek gas services  llc and the carbon dioxide operations of mkm partners  lp financing activities net cash provided by financing activities amounted to million in compared to  million in this decrease of million from the prior year was chiefly due to lower cash inflows from equity financing activities 
in may  we received million as proceeds from our initia l sale of  i units to kmr 
in august  we raised million fro m our sale of an additional  i units to kmr 
the overall decrease in funds provided by financing activities also resulted from a million increase in distributions to our partners in versus cash distributions to all partners  including kmi  increased to million in compared to million in the increase in distributions was due to o an increase in the per unit cash distributions paid  o an increase in the number of units outstanding  and o an increase in the general partner incentive distributions  which resulted from both increased cash distributions per unit and an increase in the number of common units and i units outstanding 
the overall decrease in funds provided by financing activities was partly offset by a million increase from overall debt financing activities 
during each of the years and  we purchased the pipeline and terminal businesses we acquired primarily with borrowings under our commercial paper program 
we then raised funds by completing public and private debt offerings o f senior notes and by issuing additional i units 
we then used the proceeds from these debt and equity issuances to reduce our borrowings under our commercial paper program 
in  we closed a public offering of million in principa l amount of senior notes  completed a private placement of million in principal amount of senior notes to qualified institutional buyers we then exchanged these notes with substantially identical notes that are registered under the securities act of in the fourth quarter of and retired a maturing amount of million in principal amount of senior notes 
in comparison  in  we closed a public offering of billion in principal amount of senior notes 
we paid distributions of per unit in compared to per unit i n the increase in paid distributions per unit resulted from favorable operating results in we also distributed  i units in quarterly distributions during to kmr  our sole i unitholder 
in  we distributed  i units in quarterly distributions to kmr 
the amount of i units distributed in each quarter was based upon the amount of cash we distributed to the owners of our common and class b units during that quarter of and for each outstanding i unit that kmr held  a fraction of an i unit was issued 
the fraction was determined by dividing o the cash amount distributed per common unit by o the average of kmr s shares closing market prices for the ten consecutive trading days preceding the date on which the shares began to trade ex dividend under the rules of the new york stock exchange 
partnership distributions our partnership agreement requires that we distribute of available cash as defined in our partnership agreement  to our partners within days following the end of each calendar quarter in accordance with their respective percentage interests 
available cash consists generally of all of our cash receipts  including cash received by our operating partnerships  less cash disbursements and net additions to reserves including any reserves required under debt instruments for future principal and interest payments and amounts payable to the former general partner of sfpp  lp in respect of its remaining interest in sfpp 
our general partner is granted discretion by our partnership agreement  whic h discretion has been delegated to kmr  subject to the approval of our general partner in certain cases  to establish  maintain and adjust reserves for future operating expenses  debt service  maintenance capital expenditures  rate refund s and distributions for the next four quarters 
these reserves are not restricted by magnitude  but only by type of future cash requirements with which they can be associated 
when kmr determines our quarterly distributions  it considers current and expected reserve needs along with current and expected cash flows t o identify the appropriate sustainable distribution level 
for  and  we distributed  and  of the total of cash receipts less cash disbursements  respectively calculations assume that kmr unitholders received cash 
the difference between these numbers and reflects net additions to or reductions in reserves 
typically  our general partner and owners of our common units and class b units receive distributions in cash  while kmr  the sole owner of our i units  receives distributions in additional i units 
for each outstanding i unit  a fraction of an i unit will be issued 
the fraction is calculated by dividing th e amount of cash being distributed per common unit by the average closing price o f kmr s shares over the ten consecutive trading days preceding the date on which the shares begin to trade ex dividend under the rules of the new york stock exchange 
the cash equivalent of distributions of i units will be treated as if it had actually been distributed for purposes of determining the distributions to our general partner 
we do not distribute cash to i unit owners but retain the cash for use in our business 
available cash is initially distributed to our limited partners and t o our general partner 
these distribution percentages are modified to provide for incentive distributions to be paid to our general partner in the event that quarterly distributions to unitholders exceed certain specified targets 
available cash for each quarter is distributed o first  to the owners of all classes of units pro rata and to our general partner until the owners of all classes of units have received a total of per unit in cash or equivalent i units for such quarter  o second  of any available cash then remaining to the owners of all classes of units pro rata and to our general partner until the owners of all classes of units have received a total of per unit in cash or equivalent i units for such quarter  o third  of any available cash then remaining to the owners of all classes of units pro rata and to our general partner until the owners of all classes of units have received a total of per unit in cash or equivalent i units for such quarter  and o fourth  of any available cash then remaining to the owners of all classes of units pro rata  to owners of common units and class b units in cash and to owners of i units in the equivalent number of i units  and to our general partner 
incentive distributions are generally defined as all cash distributions paid to our general partner that are in excess of of the aggregate value of cash and i units being distributed 
the general partner s incentive distribution tha t we declared for was million  while the incentive distribution paid to our general partner during was million 
the difference between declared and paid distributions is due to the fact that the partnership distributions for the fourth quarter of each year are declared and paid in the first quarter of the following year 
on february   we paid a quarterly distribution of per unit fo r the fourth quarter of this distribution was greater than the distribution per unit we paid for the fourth quarter of and greater tha n the distribution per unit we paid for the first quarter of we paid this distribution in cash to our common unitholders and to our class b unitholders 
kmr  our sole i unitholder  received additional i units based on the cash distribution per common unit

new accounting pronouncements on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
requires companies to record a liability relating to the retirement and removal of asset s used in their business 
the liability is initially recorded at its fair value  and the relative asset value is increased by the same amount 
over the life of the asset  the liability will be accreted to its future value and eventually extinguished when the asset is taken out of service 
the provisions of this statement are effective for fiscal years beginning after june  with respect to our natural gas pipelines and products pipelines business segments  we have certain surface facilities that are required to be dismantled and removed  with certain site reclamation to be performed 
while  in general  our right of way agreements do no require us to remove pipe or otherwise perform remediation upon taking the pipeline permanently out of service  some right of way agreements do provide for these actions 
with respect to our co pipelines business segment  we generally are required to plug our oil productio n wells when removed from service and we anticipate recording a liability for suc h obligation 
our terminals business segment has entered into certain facility leases which require removal of improvements upon expiration of the lease term 
we anticipate recording a liability for such obligation 
for the natural gas pipelines and products pipelines business segments  we expect that we will be unable to reasonably estimate and record liabilities for the majority of our obligations that fall under the provisions of this statement because we cannot reasonably estimate when such obligations would be settled 
for the co pipelines and terminals business segments  the effect of adopting sfas no 
is not material to the consolidated financial statements 
in april  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
this statement eliminates the current requirement that gains and losses on debt extinguishment must be classified as extraordinary items in the income statement 
instead  such gains and losses wil l be classified as extraordinary items only if they are deemed to be unusual and infrequent  in accordance with the current gaap criteria for extraordinary classification 
in addition  sfas no 
eliminates an inconsistency in lease accounting by requiring that modifications of capital leases that result in reclassification as operating leases be accounted for consistent with sale leaseback accounting rules 
this statement also contains other nonsubstantive corrections to authoritative accounting literature 
the changes related to debt extinguishment will be effective for fiscal years beginning after may   and the changes related to lease accounting will be effective for transactions occurring after may  adoption of this statement will not have any immediate effect on our consolidated financial statements 
we will apply this guidance prospectively 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which addresses accounting for restructuring and similar costs 
sfas no 
supersedes previous accounting guidance  principally emerging issues task force issue no 
we will adopt the provisions of sfas no 
for restructuring activities initiated after december  sfas no 
requires that the liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under eitf no 
 a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of the company s commitment to an exit plan 
sfas no 
also establishes that the liability should initially be measured and recorded at fair value 
accordingly  sfas no 
may affect the timing of recognizing future restructuring costs as well as the amounts recognized 
in november  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
this interpretation of financial accounting standards board statements no 
 and  and rescission of financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
this interpretation incorporates  without change  the guidance in financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 disclosure of indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  which is being superceded 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements in this interpretation are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods after december  the interpretive guidance incorporated from interpretation no 
continues to be required for financial statements for fiscal years ending after june  in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
thi s amendment to sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value base d method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the provisions of this statement are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods after december  earl y application of the disclosure provisions is encouraged  and earlier application of the transition provisions is permitted  provided that financial statements for the fiscal year have not been issued as of the date the statement was issued

our exposure to market risk as discussed below includes forward looking statements and represents an estimate of possibl e changes in fair value or future earnings that would occur assuming hypothetical future movements in interest rates or commodity prices 
our views on market ris k are not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur and do not represent the maximum possible gains and losses that may occur  since actual gains and losses will differ from those estimated  based on actual fluctuations in interest rates or commodity prices and the timing of transactions 
energy financial instruments we use energy financial instruments to reduce our risks associated with changes in the market price of natural gas  natural gas liquids  crude oil and carbon dioxide 
for a complete discussion of our risk management activities  se e note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
to minimize the risks associated with changes in the market price of natural gas  natural gas liquids  crude oil and carbon dioxide  we use certain financia l instruments for hedging purposes 
these instruments include energy products traded on the new york mercantile exchange and over the counter markets including  but not limited to  futures and options contracts  fixed price swaps and basis swaps 
during the fourth quarter of  we determined that enron corp 
was no longer likely to honor the obligations it had to us in conjunction with derivatives we were accounting for as hedges under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedgin g activities 
upon making that determination  we o ceased to account for those derivatives as hedges  o entered into new derivative transactions on substantially similar terms with other counterparties to replace our positions with enron  o designated the replacement derivative positions as hedges of the exposures that had been hedged with the enron positions  and o recognized a million loss included with general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statement of income for in recognition of the fact that it was unlikely that we would be paid the amounts then owed under the contracts with enron 
while we enter into derivative transactions only with investment grade counterparties and actively monitor their credit ratings  it is nevertheless possible that additional losses will result from counterparty credit risk in th e future 
the credit ratings of the primary parties from whom we purchase financial instruments are as follows credit rating j 
aron company goldman sachs a morgan stanley a deutsche bank aa pursuant to our management s approved policy  we are to engage in these activities only as a hedging mechanism against price volatility associated with o pre existing or anticipated physical natural gas  natural gas liquids  crude oil and carbon dioxide sales  o natural gas purchases  and o system use and storage 
our risk management activities are only used in order to protect our profit margins and our risk management policies prohibit us from engaging in speculative trading 
commodity related activities of our risk management group are monitored by our risk management committee  which is charged with the revie w and enforcement of our management s risk management policy 
through december   gains and losses on hedging positions were deferred and recognized as cost of sales in the periods in which the underlying physical transactions occurred 
on january   we began accounting for derivative instruments under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities after amendment by sfas no 
and sfas no 

as discussed above  our principal use of derivative financial instruments is to mitigate the market price risk associated with anticipated transactions for the purchase and sale of natural gas  natural gas liquids  crude oil and carbon dioxide 
sfas no 
allows these transactions to continue to be treated as hedges for accounting purposes  although the changes in the market value of these instruments will affect comprehensive income in the period in which they occur and any ineffectiveness in the risk mitigation performance of the hedge will affect net income currently 
the change in the market value of these instruments representing effective hedge operation will continue to affect net income in the period in which the associated physical transactions are consummated 
our adoption of sfa s no 
has resulted in million of deferred net loss being reported as accumulated other comprehensive income in the accompanying balance sheet at december   and million of deferred net gain being reported as accumulated other comprehensive income in the accompanying balance sheet at december  we measure the risk of price changes in the natural gas  natural gas liquids crude oil and carbon dioxide markets utilizing a value at risk model 
value at risk is a statistical measure of how much the mark to market value of a portfolio could change during a period of time  within a certain level of statistical confidence 
we utilize a closed form model to evaluate risk on a daily basis 
the value at risk computations utilize a confidence level of for the resultant price movement and a holding period of one day chosen for the calculation 
the confidence level used means that there is a probability that the mark to market losses for a single day will not exceed the value at risk number presented 
financial instruments evaluated by the model include commodity futures and options contracts  fixed price swaps  basis swaps and over the counter options 
for each of the years ended december  and  value at risk reached a high of million and million  respectively  and a low of million and million  respectively 
value at risk at december   was million and averaged millio n for value at risk at december   was million and averaged million for our calculated value at risk exposure represents an estimate of the reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on our portfolio of derivatives assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates  and is not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur 
it does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur  since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated 
actual gains and losses may differ from estimates due to actual fluctuations in market rates  operating exposures and the timing thereof  as well as changes in our portfolio of derivatives during the year 
in addition  as discussed preceding  we enter into these derivatives solely for the purpose of mitigating the risks that accompany certain of our business activities and  therefore  the change in the market value of our portfolio of derivatives is  with the exception of a minor amount of hedging inefficiency  offset by changes in the value of the underlyin g physical transactions 
interest rate risk the market risk inherent in our debt instruments and positions is the potential change arising from increases or decreases in interest rates as discussed below 
we utilize both variable rate and fixed rate debt in our financing strategy 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information related to our debt instruments 
for fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates generally affect the fair value of the deb t instrument  but not our earnings or cash flows 
conversely  for variable rate debt  changes in interest rates generally do not impact the fair value of the debt instrument  but may affect our future earnings and cash flows 
we do not have an obligation to prepay fixed rate debt prior to maturity and  as a result interest rate risk and changes in fair value should not have a significant impact on our fixed rate debt until we would be required to refinance such debt as of december  and  the carrying values of our long term fixed rate debt were approximately  million and  million  respectively  compared to fair values of  million and  million  respectively 
the increase in the excess of fair value over carrying value is primarily due to the decrease in interest rates during fair values were determined using quoted market prices  where applicable  or future cash flow discounted at market rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements 
a hypothetical change in the average interest rates applicable to such debt for and  respectively  would result in changes of approximately million and million  respectively  in the fair values of these instruments 
the carrying value and fair value of our variable rate debt  including associated accrued interest and excluding market value of interest rate swaps  was million as of december  and million as of december fair value was determined using future cash flows discounted based on market rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements 
a hypothetical change in the average interest rate applicable to this debt would result in a change of approximately million and million in our and annualized pre tax earnings  respectively 
as of december   we were party to interest rate swap agreements with a notional principal amount of billion for the purpose of hedging the interest rate risk associated with our fixed and variable rate debt obligations a hypothetical change in the average interest rates related to these swaps would not have a material effect on our annual pre tax earnings in or we monitor our mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt obligations in light of changing market conditions and from time to time may alter that mix by  for example  refinancing balances outstanding under our variable rate debt with fixed rate debt or vice versa or by entering into interest rate swaps or othe r interest rate hedging agreements 
as of december   our cash and investment portfolio did not include fixed income securities 
due to the short term nature of our investment portfolio  a hypothetical increase in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio 
since we have the ability to liquidate this portfolio  we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be materially affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our investment portfolio
