item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion and analysis focuses on information about banctrust financial group  inc formerly south alabama bancorporation  inc 
and its subsidiaries  banktrust formerly south alabama bank  banktrust of brewton formerly first national bank  brewton  the monroe county bank  the commercial bank of demopolis  sweet water state bank  wewahitchka state bank and south alabama trust company  inc  that is not otherwise apparent from the consolidated financial statements and related footnotes appearing below in this annual report 
reference should be made to those statements and the financial data presented elsewhere in this report for a complete understanding of the following discussion and analysis 
on april   gulf coast community bancshares  inc  the parent company of wewahitchka state bank  was merged into the company 
this merger has been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
therefore  the results of operations of wewahitchka state bank have been included in the consolidated results of the company from april  summary net income for was million compared to million in on a per share basis  basic earnings were

critical accounting policies relate to allowance for loan losses and intangible assets 
a description of these policies is as follows allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level considered by management to be sufficient to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
management s determination of the adequacy of the allowance and the amount of the provision charged to expense is based on periodic reviews of the portfolio  past loan loss experience  current economic conditions and such other factors which  in management s judgment  deserve current recognition in estimating loan losses 
this determination also considers the balance of impaired loans which are generally considered to be nonperforming loans  excluding residential mortgages and other homogeneous loans 
specific allowances for impaired loans are based on comparisons of the recorded carrying values of the loans to the present value of these loans estimated cash flows at each loan s effective interest rate  the fair value of the collateral  or the loans observable market price 
recovery of the carrying value of loans is dependent to a great extent on economic  operating and other conditions that may be beyond the company s control 
the provision for loan losses is the cost of providing an allowance that is adequate to absorb inherent losses on loans in the portfolio 
management reviews the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on a continuous basis by assessing the quality of the loan portfolio and adjusting the allowance when appropriate 
loan review procedures are in place to ensure that potential problem loans are identified 
the procedures include a continuous review of the portfolios at the affiliate banks by the company s loan review department 
management s evaluation of each loan includes a review of the financial condition and capacity of the borrower  the value of the collateral  current economic trends  historical losses  work out and collection arrangements  and possible con centrations of credit 
the loan review process also includes an evaluation of credit quality within the mortgage and installment loan portfolios 
in establishing the allowance  loss percentages are applied to groups of loans with similar risk characteristics 
these loss percentages are determined by historical experience  portfolio mix  and other economic factors 
each quarter this review is quantified in a report to management which uses it to determine whether an appropriate allowance is maintained 
this report is then submitted to the company s board of directors quarterly 
the amount of the allowance is affected by i loan charge offs  which decrease the allowance  ii recoveries on loans previously charged off  which increase the allowance  and iii the provisions for loan losses charged to income  which increase the allowance 
intangible assets goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives created by business combinations accounted for under the purchase method of accounting subsequent to june  are no longer amortized  but instead are tested for impairment annually 
an impairment loss is recognized in the statement of income if the carrying value of a reporting segment s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of its related goodwill 
core deposit intangible assets generated in business combinations are amortized over years

between year end and year end  commercial  financial and agricultural loans increased by million  real estate construction loans increased by million  installment loans increased by million  and real estate mortgage loans increased by million 
most of these increases are due to the purchase of the wewahitchka bank 
it is management s goal to make loans with relatively short maturities or  in the case of loans with longer maturities  with floating rate arrangements when possible 
of the outstanding loans in the categories of commercial  financial and agricultural  real estate construction and real estate mortgage at december   million  or percent  mature within one year and are therefore subject to interest rate changes  if needed  to adjust for asset liability management purposes 
of the remaining loans in these categories maturing after one year  percent are on a floating rate basis 
of the total loans outstanding in these categories at december   percent are available for repricing within one year  either because the loans mature within one year or because they are based on a variable rate arrangement 
the company makes available to its customers fixed rate  longer term loans  especially in the residential real estate mortgage area 
banctrust is able to offer  through third party arrangements  certain loan products which do not require that the longer term loans be carried on the books of the company 
these products allow the company to gain the benefit of a larger variety of product offerings and have generated a significant amount of fee income during the recent period of lower mortgage rates 
these fees have come from home purchases as well as significant home refinancing volume 
if interest rates rise  the company expects that this volume will decrease 
table shows the distribution of loans by major category at december   and at each of the previous four year ends

 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities requires that securities be classified into one of three categories held to maturity  available for sale  or trading 
securities classified as held to maturity are stated at amortized cost 
this classification means that management has the positive intent  and the company has the ability  to hold the securities until they mature 
securities classified as available for sale are stated at fair value 
securities in this category are held for indefinite periods of time  and include securities that management intends to use as part of its asset liability strategy  or that may be sold in response to changes in interest rates  changes in prepayment risks  changes in liquidity needs  the need to increase regulatory capital or other similar factors 
at december   all of the company s securities were in the available for sale category 
the company holds no trading securities or those classified as held to maturity 
the maturities and weighted average yields of securities available for sale at december   are presented in table at amortized cost using the average stated contractual maturities 
the average stated contractual maturities may differ from the average expected life because of amortized principal payments or because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations 
the equivalent adjustments  using a percent tax rate  have been made when calculating yields on tax exempt obligations

core deposits  as a percentage of total deposits  decreased in as they represented percent of total deposits at year end  compared to percent at year end while the primary emphasis at banctrust remains on attracting and retaining core deposits  management recognizes that  in order to fund loan growth  it might be necessary from time to time to pursue non core funding sources such as large certificates of deposit and other borrowed funds more vigorously than in the past

the company sold federal funds of million on average during while average short term borrowings were only million 
management has sought to control the volume of funds in this category within certain acceptable limits  however  a greater reliance on these types of funds may be necessary in order to fund loan growth in the future 
one of management s asset liability management goals relating to liquidity is to maintain a net sold position whereby federal funds sold exceeds short term borrowings 
average loan growth of percent in combined with no growth in average deposits caused average short term borrowings to exceed average federal funds sold by million  however  in and average federal funds sold again exceeded short term borrowings

    other  total short term borrowings    asset liability management the purpose of asset liability management is to maximize return while minimizing risk 
maximizing return means achieving or exceeding the company s profitability and growth goals 
minimizing risk means managing four key risk factors liquidity  interest rate sensitivity  capital adequacy  and asset quality 
asset liability management at the company involves a comprehensive approach to statement of condition management which meets the risk and return criteria established by management and the board of directors 
to this point  management has not used derivative financial instruments as part of its asset liability management process 
the company s primary market risk is its exposure to interest rate changes 
interest rate risk management strategies are designed to optimize net interest income while minimizing fluctuations caused by changes in the interest rate environment 
it is through these strategies that the company seeks to manage the maturity and repricing characteristics of its statement of condition 
the modeling techniques used by the company simulate net interest income and impact on fair values of the company s assets and liabilities under various rate scenarios 
important elements of these techniques include the mix of floating versus fixed rate assets and liabilities  and the scheduled  as well as expected  repricing and maturing volumes and rates on the existing statement of condition 
under a scenario simulating a hypothetical basis point rate increase applied to all interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the company would expect a net decrease in net interest income of thousand 
under a scenario simulating a hypothetical basis point decrease  the company would expect a net increase in net interest income of thousand 
these hypothetical examples are not a precise indicator of future events 
instead  they are reasonable estimates of the results anticipated if the assumptions used in the modeling techniques were to occur 
liquidity liquidity represents the ability of a bank to meet loan commitments as well as deposit withdrawals 
liquidity is derived from both the asset side and the liability side of the statement of condition 
on the asset side  liquidity is provided by marketable investment securities  maturing loans  federal funds sold and cash and cash equivalents 
on the liability side  liquidity is provided by a stable base of core deposits 
additionally  the company has available  if needed  federal funds lines of credit  federal home loan bank lines of credit and an operating line of credit from a correspondent bank

table commitments in thousands one year over one year over or less through five years five years total lines of credit unused   standby letters of credit     total     interest rate sensitivity by monitoring the company s interest rate sensitivity  management attempts to maintain a desired balance between the growth of net interest revenue and the risks that might result from significant changes in interest rates in the market 
one tool for measurement of this risk is gap analysis  whereby the repricing of assets and liabilities is compared within certain time categories 
by identifying mismatches in repricing opportunities within a time category  interest rate risk can be identified 
the interest sensitivity analysis presented in table is based on this type of gap analysis  which assumes that rates earned on interest earning assets and rates paid on interest bearing liabilities will move simultaneously in the same direction and to the same extent 
however  the rates associated with these assets and liabilities actually change at different times and in varying amounts 
changes in the composition of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities can increase or decrease net interest revenue without affecting interest sensitivity 
the interest rate spread between assets and their corresponding liability can be significantly changed while the repricing interval for both remains unchanged  thus impacting net interest revenue 
over a period of time  net interest revenue can increase or decrease if one side of the statement of condition reprices before the other side 
an interest sensitivity ratio of earning assets divided by interest bearing liabilities  which represents a matched interest sensitive position  does not guarantee maximum net interest revenue 
before investing  management must evaluate several factors  including the general direction of interest rates  in order to determine the type of investment and the maturity needed 
management may  from time to time  accept calculated risks associated with interest sensitivity in an attempt to maximize net interest revenue 
the company does not currently use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate sensitivity 
at december   the company s three month gap position  earning assets divided by interest bearing liabilities  was percent  and at twelve months the gap position  on a cumulative basis  was percent  both within the range established by management as acceptable 
the company s three month gap position indicates that  in a period of rising interest rates  each of assets which reprice upward could be followed with more than in liabilities which could reprice upward within three months 
thus  under this scenario  net interest revenue might decrease during the three month period of rising rates 
in a period of falling rates  the opposite effect might occur 
while certain categories  such as some loans and certain certificates of deposit  are contractually tied to interest rate movements  most are subject only to competitive pressures and do not necessarily reprice directly with changes in market rates 
management has a certain amount of flexibility when adjusting rates on these products

non accrual loans are included in the non interest sensitive within years category 
certain types of savings and now accounts included in interest bearing demand deposits are included in the non interest sensitive within years category 
in management s opinion  these liabilities do not reprice in the same proportions as rate sensitive assets  as they are not responsive to general interest rate changes in the economy 
capital resources tangible shareholders equity shareholders equity less goodwill and accumulated other comprehensive income was million at december   compared to million at december   an increase of percent 
at year end  the tier i capital ratio decreased to percent from percent at year end  primarily a result of the increase in risk weighted assets and the purchase of treasury stock 
during  the company purchased thousand shares of treasury stock for approximately million 
the company s leverage ratio  defined as tangible shareholders equity divided by quarterly average assets  was percent at year end  well above peer group averages 
the federal reserve and the fdic require that bank holding companies and banks maintain certain minimum levels of capital as defined by risk based capital guidelines 
these guidelines consider risk factors associated with various components of assets  both on and off the statement of condition 
under these guidelines  capital is measured in two tiers  and these capital tiers are used in conjunction with risk based assets in determining risk based capital ratios 
total capital was million at december  the ratios  expressed as a percent of total risk adjusted assets  for tier i and total capital were percent and percent  respectively  at december  the company exceeded the minimum risk based capital guidelines at december    and see footnote of notes to consolidated financial statements

changes in interest rates  changes in the volume of assets and liabilities  and changes in the asset liability mix are the major factors that influence net interest revenue 
presented in table is an analysis of net interest revenue  weighted average yields on earning assets and weighted average rates paid on interest bearing liabilities for the past three years 
net yield on interest earning assets is net interest revenue  on a tax equivalent basis  divided by total interest earning assets 
this ratio is a measure of the company s effectiveness in pricing interest earning assets and funding them with both interest bearing and non interest bearing liabilities 
the company s net yield  on a tax equivalent basis  decreased to percent in from percent in the numerous and rapid interest rate reductions in were still having an adverse effect in  and caused rates earned on loans and other interest earning assets to decrease more rapidly than rates paid on the liabilities  primarily deposits  used to support those assets 
from to  the net yield decreased from percent to percent 
although the net yield at the company had increased for several years prior to  the banking industry trend had been toward lower net interest yields over the past several years 
management had expected this trend to continue in the industry  resulting in the eventual decrease in net interest margins at banctrust 
the twelve month  basis point reduction in key short term rates in plus the basis point decrease in  accelerated this margin decrease

tax equivalent net interest revenue in was million lower than in rapidly falling interest rates in caused total interest revenue to be million lower than the prior year

provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses the provision for loan losses is the cost of providing an allowance that is adequate to absorb inherent losses on loans in the portfolio 
management reviews the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on a continuous basis by assessing the quality of the loan portfolio and adjusting the allowance when appropriate 
loan review procedures are in place to ensure that potential problem loans are identified 
the procedures include a continuous review of the portfolios at the affiliate banks by the company s loan review department 
management s evaluation of each loan includes a review of the financial condition and capacity of the borrower  the value of the collateral  current economic trends  historical losses  work out and collection arrangements  and possible concentrations of credit 
the loan review process also includes an evaluation of credit quality within the mortgage and installment loan portfolios 
in establishing the allowance  loss percentages are applied to groups of loans with similar risk characteristics 
these loss percentages are determined by historical experience  portfolio mix  and other economic factors 
each quarter this review is quantified in a report to management which uses it to determine whether an appropriate allowance is maintained 
this report is then submitted to the company s board of directors quarterly

inflation has an impact on the growth of total assets in the banking industry and the resulting need to increase capital at higher than normal rates in order to maintain an appropriate equity to assets ratio 
inflation also has a significant effect on other expenses  which tend to rise during periods of general inflation 
management believes  however  that the company s financial results are influenced more by its ability to react to changes in interest rates than by inflation 
except as discussed in this management s discussion and analysis  management is not aware of trends  events or uncertainties that will have or that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the liquidity  capital resources or operations of the company
