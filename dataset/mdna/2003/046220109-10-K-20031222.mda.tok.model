overview we acquire  manage  collect and service portfolios of consumer receivables 
these portfolios generally consist of one or more of the following types of consumer receivables o charged off receivables accounts that have been written off by the originators and may have been previously serviced by collection agencies  o semi performing receivables accounts where the debtor is making partial or irregular monthly payments  but the accounts may have been written off by the originators  and o performing receivables accounts where the debtor is making regular monthly payments that may or may not have been delinquent in the past 
we acquire these consumer receivable portfolios at a significant discount to the amount actually owed by the borrowers 
we acquire these portfolios after a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the underlying receivables and calculate the purchase price so that our estimated cash flow offers us an adequate return on our acquisition costs and servicing expenses 
after purchasing a portfolio  we actively monitor its performance and review and adjust our collection and servicing strategies accordingly 
critical accounting policies we account for our investments in consumer receivable portfolios  using either the interest method or the cost recovery method 
generally  each purchase is considered a separate portfolio of receivables and is considered a financial investment 
based upon the expected performance characteristics of the receivables in the portfolio  we determine whether the portfolio should be accounted for using the interest method or the cost recovery method 
if we can reasonably estimate the amount to be collected on a portfolio and can reasonably determine the timing of such payments based on historic experience and other factors  we use the interest method 
if we cannot reasonably estimate the future cash flows  we use the cost recovery method 
if the interest method is used in recognizing income on a portfolio  it is done so in accordance with the aicpa s practice bulletin  amortization of discounts on certain acquired loans 
practice bulletin requires that the accrual basis of accounting be used at the time the amount and timing of cash flows from an acquired portfolio can be reasonably estimated and collection is probable 
the interest method allows us to recognize income on the effective yield of such portfolio based on the actual cash collected during a period and future estimated cash flows and the timing of such collections and the purchase of such portfolios 
under this method  we periodically apply a portion of the actual funds collected as a reduction in the principal amount invested in each specific portfolio and the remainder is recognized as finance income 
generally  these portfolios are expected to amortize over a three to five year period based upon our estimated future cash flows 
historically  a majority of the cash we ultimately collect on a portfolio is received during the first months after acquiring the portfolio  although additional amounts are collected over the remaining period 
the estimated future cash flows of the portfolios are reevaluated quarterly 
under the cost recovery method of accounting  no income is recognized until the purchase price of a portfolio has been fully recovered by us 
we periodically review our receivable portfolios for impairment based on the estimated future cash flows 
provisions for losses are charged to operations when it is determined that the remaining investment in the receivable portfolio is greater than the estimated future collections 
for the year ended september   we recorded  write off on a receivable portfolio against a reserve previously established 
based on increases in actual cash flows for the year ended september   and projected future cash flows through september   on certain portfolios as compared to what we estimated at september   we revised our estimate of future collections 
such change in accounting estimate has resulted in approximately an million increase in finance income recognized for the year ended september  for these portfolios 
we typically recognize finance income net of collection fees paid to third party collection agencies 
with respect to several recent purchases of consumer receivable portfolios containing a significant amount of performing and semi performing accounts  we recognize finance income on accounts that were being serviced by third party servicers at the gross amounts received by the servicers 
the servicing costs for these portfolios are reported as an expense on our income statement 
in addition  with respect to specific consumer receivable portfolios we acquired  we agreed to a fifty percent profit sharing arrangement with our lender 
however  the interest in this profit sharing arrangement held by our lender was sold to us and a third party in equal amounts in december the third party profit allocation was recorded as interest expense over the estimated term of the related note payable 
during the year ended september   actual and estimated collections have exceeded our estimates at september   and therefore we have revised our third party profit allocation 
such change in accounting estimate has resulted in approximately a million interest expense charge during the year ended september  results of operations the following discussion of our operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this prospectus 
in these discussions  most percentages and dollar amounts have been rounded to aid presentation 
as a result  all such figures are approximations 
year ended september  compared to the year ended september  revenues 
for the year ended september   finance income decreased million or to million from million for the year ended september  the decrease in finance income was primarily due to a decrease in finance income earned on consumer receivables acquired for liquidation  which resulted from a decrease in the average outstanding accounts acquired for liquidation during the first six months of the fiscal year ended september   as compared to the same prior year period 
in addition  the sale of most of the factored receivables on november   resulted in a decrease in finance income on these receivables during the year ended september  as compared to september  based on increases in actual cash flows for the year ended september   and projected future cash flows on certain portfolios as compared to what we estimated at september   we revised our estimate of future collections 
such change in accounting estimate has resulted in approximately an million increase in finance income recognized for the year ended september  for these portfolios 
due to what management believed were competitive factors  we only spent million on receivable purchases during the first six months in the year ended september   but during the last six months of this same period  we spent million on receivable purchases 
general and administrative expenses 
for the year ended september   general and administrative expenses increased million or to million from million for the year ended september   and represented of total expenses for the year ended september  the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in salaries and other servicing costs which was partially offset by a decrease in factoring expenses during the year ended september  as compared to september  most of the increase in servicing expenses resulted from the operating costs of our call center that was acquired in december and an increase in court cost expenditures this fiscal year as compared to the same prior year period 
the decrease in factoring expenses resulted from the sale of most of the factored receivables on november  third party servicing expenses 
for the year ended september   third party servicing expenses decreased million or to million from million for the year ended september   and represented of total expenses for the year ended september  the decrease in third party servicing expenses was primarily due to a reduction in the number of accounts being serviced on a portfolio that was purchased in august and the elimination of recording third party servicing expenses on a specific portfolio during the year ended september  interest expense 
for the year ended september   interest expense decreased million or to million from million for the year ended september   and represented of total expenses for the year ended september  most of the decrease was due to a reduction in the accrual of interest expense that was due to profit participation on a specific portfolio during the year ended september   as compared to the same prior year period 
during the year ended september   actual and estimated collections have exceeded our estimates at september   and therefore we have revised our third party profit allocation 
such change in accounting estimate has resulted in approximately a million interest expense charge during the year ended september  provision for credit losses 
for the year ended september   the provision for credit losses decreased million or to from million for the year ended september   and represented of total expenses for the year ended september  the decrease was due to a decrease in the provision for credit losses on our financed receivables during the year ended september   as compared to the prior year 
net income 
for the year ended september   net income increased million or to million from million for the year ended september  net income per share for the year ended september  decreased per share diluted or to per share diluted from per share diluted for the year ended september  the decrease in earnings per share is a result of a higher weighted average number of shares outstanding diluted compared to the prior period  primarily resulting from the secondary stock offering in june year ended september  compared to the year ended september  revenues 
for the year ended september   finance income increased million or to million from million for the year ended september  the increase in finance income was primarily due to an increase in collections on consumer receivables acquired for liquidation  which resulted from an increase in the average outstanding accounts acquired for liquidation during the year ended september  as compared to september  the increase in other income resulted from a fee earned on the sale of certain receivables and the receipt of a break up fee on an unsuccessful purchase of consumer receivables during the year ended september   which was offset by a decrease in servicing fee income which was due to a decrease in the dollar amount of contracts being serviced as a result of the continuing decline in automobile contracts being serviced for others 
general and administrative expenses 
for the year ended september   general and administrative expenses increased million or to million from million for the year ended september  and represented of total expenses for the year ended september  the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in salaries and other costs associated with an increase in consumer receivables that were purchased during the fiscal year ended september  and were being were serviced internally by us during the entire year ended september   as compared to the same prior year period and a  consulting fee expense during the year ended september   that was not incurred during the same prior year period 
this increase in servicing costs on consumer receivables acquired for liquidation was partially off set by a decrease in serving costs related to servicing automobile contracts for the year ended september  as compared to the prior year 
third party servicing expenses 
for the year ended september   third party servicing expenses increased million or to million from million for the year ended september   and represented of total expenses for the year ended september  the increase in third party servicing expenses was primarily due to servicing costs on consumer receivables that were serviced by others during the entire year ended september  and that were not being serviced during the prior year 
interest expense 
for the year ended september   interest expense increased million or to million from million for the year period ended september   and represented of total expenses for the year ended september  the increase was partially due to an increase in the outstanding borrowings under our lines of credit and notes payable during the year ended september   as compared to the same period in the prior year 
the increase in borrowings was partially due to the increase in acquisitions of consumer receivables acquired for liquidation during the fiscal year ended september  in addition  a substantial portion of the increase was due to a lender profit participation that was accrued on a certain portfolio during the entire year ended september   that was only outstanding for one month in the prior fiscal year and was included in interest expense 
provision for credit losses 
for the year ended september   the provision for credit losses increased million or to million from million for the year ended september   and represented of total expenses for the year ended september  the increase was due to an increase in the provision for financed receivables during the year ended september   as compared to the prior year 
net income 
for the year ended september   net income increased million or to million from million for the year ended september  during the year ended september   net income per share increased per share diluted or to per share diluted from per share diluted for the year ended september  the increase in earnings per share was less than the increase in net income as a result of a higher weighted average number of shares outstanding diluted compared to the prior year 
liquidity and capital resources as of september   we had cash and cash equivalents of million compared to million at september  the increase in cash and cash equivalents at september   was primarily due to a decrease in the repayment of debt for the year ended september  as compared to the prior year 
primary sources of cash from operations include payments on the receivable portfolios that we have acquired 
our primary uses of cash include our purchases of consumer receivable portfolios 
we rely significantly upon our lenders and others  including our affiliates  to provide the funds necessary for the purchase of consumer and commercial accounts receivable portfolios 
we have maintained a million line of credit for portfolio purchases in fiscal  which was increased to million on november  in addition  we also arrange for financing on a transactional basis 
while we have historically been able to finance portfolio purchases  we do not have committed loan facilities  other than our line of credit with a financial institution 
as of september  and november   we had outstanding borrowings of and million respectively under this facility and we were in compliance with all of the covenants under this line of credit 
the following table shows the changes in finance receivables  including amounts paid to acquire new portfolios year ended september  in millions balance at beginning of period acquisitions of finance receivables  net of buybacks cash collections  including sales  applied to principal portfolio writedown balance at end of period cash collections applied to principal consists of cash collections less income recognized on finance receivables plus amounts received by us from the sale of consumer receivable portfolios to third parties 
net cash provided by operating activities was million during the year ended september   compared to million during the year ended september  the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in income taxes payable and other liabilities and an increase in other assets at september   compared to the prior year 
net cash used in investing activities was million during the year ended september   compared to net cash provided by investing activities of million during the year ended september  the decrease in cash from investing activities was primarily due to an increase in purchases of consumer receivables acquired for liquidation during the year ended september   compared to the prior year 
net cash provided by financing activities was million during the year ended september   compared to net cash used in financing activities of million for the prior year 
the increase in net cash provided by financing was primarily due to the proceeds of million from our common stock offering and a million increase in borrowings during the year ended september   as compared to the prior year 
the increase in borrowings resulted from an increase in purchases of accounts acquired for liquidation during the last six months of the year ended september   as compared to the year ended september  as of september   we had a million line of credit with interest at the prime rate which was at september  this line of credit was increased to million on november  the advances under this credit line are collateralized by portfolios of consumer receivables acquired for liquidation  and the loan agreement contains customary financial and operating covenants that must be maintained in order for us to borrow funds 
this line expires on january  as of september  and november   we had outstanding borrowings of and million respectively under this line of credit and we were in compliance with all of the covenants under this line of credit 
in august  an investment banking firm provided approximately million of financing in exchange for a note with interest at libor plus and the right to receive of subsequent collections  net of expenses  from the portfolio collateralizing the obligation  once the note and advances by one of our subsidiaries have been repaid 
in december  we purchased one half of this right to receive subsequent collections for million and a third party purchased the other one half for million 
the participation due a third party has been accrued and is included in other liabilities 
as of december   this note was paid in full 
in january  we purchased a interest in a consumer receivable portfolio and financed the entire purchase price of million through a note to the seller 
the note bears interest at 
the outstanding balance was payable from the cash flows of a specific portfolio 
this note was paid in full in september our cash requirements have been and will continue to be significant 
we depend on external financing to acquire consumer receivables 
during the year ended september   we acquired consumer portfolios at a cost of approximately million having an aggregate outstanding balance totaling approximately billion 
we anticipate that the net proceeds to us from our secondary offering  funds available under our current credit facility as well as funds that may be made available by asta group  incorporated  an affiliate of ours  and cash from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our estimated cash requirements for at least the next months 
we are currently negotiating with our bank to obtain an increase in our line of credit above million and to extend the line for periods beyond january  if we are unable to obtain an increase and or an extension of our line of credit  this may have a negative impact in our growth 
if for any reason our available cash otherwise proves to be insufficient to fund operations because of future changes in the industry  general economic conditions  unanticipated increases in expenses  or other factors  including acquisitions  we may be required to seek additional funding 
although we have no present plans or intentions  we may consider possible acquisitions of  or investments in  complementary businesses 
any such possible acquisitions or investments may be material and may require us to incur a significant amount of debt or issue a significant amount of equity securities 
further  any business that we acquire or invest in will likely have its own capital needs  which may be significant  and which we may be called upon to satisfy 
supplementary information on consumer receivables portfolios portfolio purchases year ended september  in millions aggregate purchase price aggregate portfolio face amount   schedule of portfolios by income recognition category september  september  september  cost interest cost interest cost interest recovery method recovery method recovery method portfolios portfolios portfolios portfolios portfolios portfolios in millions original purchase price at period end cumulative aggregate managed portfolios at period end      receivable carrying value at period end finance income earned for the respective period total cash flows for the respective period the original purchase price reflects what we paid for the receivables from through the end of the respective period 
the cumulative aggregate managed portfolio balance is the original aggregate amount owed by the borrowers at the end of the respective period 
we purchase consumer receivables at substantial discounts from the face amount 
we record interest income on our receivables under either the cost recovery or interest method 
the receivable carrying value represents the current basis in the receivables after collections and amortization of the original price 
we do not anticipate collecting the majority of the purchased principal amounts 
accordingly  the difference between the carrying value of the portfolios and the gross receivables is not indicative of future revenues from these accounts acquired for liquidation 
since we purchased these accounts at significant discounts  we anticipate collecting only a portion of the face amounts 
for the year ended september   we earned interest income of million under the cost recovery method because we collected million in excess of our purchase price on certain receivable portfolios 
in addition  we earned million of interest income under the interest method based on actuarial computations on certain portfolios based on actual collections during the period based on what we project to collect in future periods 
the sum of total cash flows of million less the sum of total finance income earned on consumer receivables acquired for liquidation of million  is million or the principal amortized on receivables acquired for liquidation as per the statement of cash flows for the year ended september  new accounting pronouncements we have adopted the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure effective december sfas amends fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation and also amends the disclosure requirements of sfas to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the methods of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
as permitted by sfas and sfas  we continue to apply the accounting provisions of accounting principles board opinion number  accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  with regard to the measurement of compensation cost for options granted under our stock option plans 
no employee compensation expense has been recorded as all options granted had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  which establishes standards for the classifications and measurement of certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liability and equity 
this statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective for us on july   unless further revised 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
the objective of this interpretation is to provide guidance on how to identify a variable interest entity vie and determine when assets  liabilities  noncontrolling interests  and results of operations of a vie need to be included in a company s consolidated financial statements 
a company that holds variable interests in an entity will need to consolidate the entity if the company s interest in the vie is such that the company will absorb a majority of the vie s expected losses and or receive a majority of the entity s expected residual returns  if they occur 
fin also requires additional disclosures by primary beneficiaries and other significant variable interest holders 
the provisions of this interpretation became effective in part upon issuance and otherwise for interim periods beginning after june  we do not expect the interpretation to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
seasonality and trends our management believes that our operations may  to some extent  be affected by high delinquency rates and by lower recoveries on consumer receivables acquired for liquidation during or shortly following certain holiday periods 
in addition  on occasion the market for acquiring distressed receivables does become more competitive thereby possibly diminishing our ability to acquire such distressed receivables at attractive prices in future periods 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various types of market risk in the normal course of business  including the impact of interest rate changes and changes in corporate tax rates 
a material change in these rates could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows 
a basis point increase in interest rates could increase our annual interest expense by  for each million of variable debt outstanding for the entire fiscal year 
we do not invest in derivative financial or commodity instruments 
inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations for the years ended september   and
