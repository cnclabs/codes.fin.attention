unless otherwise specified or the context requires otherwise  the terms we  our and us refer to idx systems corporation and its subsidiaries 
general founded in  idx systems corporation provides information technology software and service solutions to maximize value in the delivery of healthcare by improving the quality of patient service  enhancing medical outcomes and reducing the costs of care 
healthcare providers purchase idx systems  which are designed to be complementary and functionally rich  to improve their patients experience through simpler access  safer care delivery and more streamlined accounting 
revenue growth is driven by demand for new healthcare information technology systems and services as well as installation  maintenance and service to our existing customers  which total more than  installation sites and include more than  physicians 
earnings growth is driven primarily by software sales  which yield significantly higher gross profit margins than our other revenue components hardware and services 
we believe our biggest opportunity for both revenue and earnings growth will be driven by the increasing demand for safer care delivery and improved business performance both of which we believe can be significantly improved through automation 
we measure financial performance by monitoring revenue and backlog from systems and services  days sales outstanding  recurring revenue  gross profit margin  operating profit margin and bookings 
revenues increased to million from million in systems sales  which include software and hardware sales  increased in  while maintenance and service fees grew as compared to the prior year 
revenues reflect increased demand for software and services as well as improved system implementation 
we reported operating income of million in compared to an operating loss of million in  an increase of million 
in  we reported net income of million  or per share  as compared to a net loss of million  or per share for  an increase of million 
in our earnings announcement dated february   we provided investors with revenue guidance of million and earnings guidance of per share 
guidance assumes a tax rate and no special items in critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
those estimates are based on our 
table of contents experience  terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources  which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  and may potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we have identified the following as critical accounting policies to our company revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  capitalization of software development costs  income taxes  restructuring and lease abandonment charges  and accounting for litigation  commitments and contingencies 
this listing is not a comprehensive list of all of idx s accounting policies 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we license software and sell hardware  related ancillary products and transcription services to customers through our direct sales force 
we generally recognize revenue from software license  hardware  and related ancillary product revenues using the residual method when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  which is typically when a customer has signed a non cancelable sales and software license agreement  delivery  which is typically fob shipping point  is complete for the software either physically or electronically  hardware and related ancillary products  the customer s fee is deemed to be fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties  collectibility is probable  and vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists for all undelivered elements  typically maintenance and professional services 
under the residual method  we defer revenue recognition of the fair value of the undelivered elements and we allocate the remaining portion of the arrangement fee to the delivered elements and recognize it as revenue  assuming all other conditions for revenue recognition have been satisfied 
we recognize substantially all of our product revenue in this manner 
if we cannot determine the fair value of any undelivered element included in an arrangement  we will defer revenue recognition until all elements are delivered  services are performed or until fair value can be objectively determined 
as part of an arrangement  we typically sell maintenance contracts as well as professional services to customers 
maintenance services include telephone and web based support as well as rights to unspecified upgrades and enhancements  when and if we make them generally available 
professional services are deemed to be non essential and typically are for implementation planning  loading of software  installation of hardware  training  building simple interfaces  running test data  and assisting in the development and documentation of process rules  and best practices consulting 
we recognize revenues from maintenance services ratably over the term of the maintenance contract period based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value 
vendor specific objective evidence of fair value is based upon the amount charged for maintenance when purchased separately  which is typically the contract s renewal rate 
maintenance services are typically stated separately in an arrangement 

table of contents we generally recognize revenues from professional services based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value when a non cancelable agreement for the services has been signed or a customer s purchase order has been received  and the professional services have been delivered 
vendor specific objective evidence of fair value is based upon the price charged when professional services are sold separately and is typically based on an hourly rate for professional services 
we generally recognize revenue from transcription services based on a reliable  verifiable and objectively determinable measure of fair value when a non cancelable agreement for the services has been signed or a customer s purchase order has been received  and the transcription services have been delivered 
we base the fair value of transcription services upon the price charged when these services are sold separately 
transcription services are typically charged at a per line rate 
our arrangements with customers generally include acceptance provisions 
however  these acceptance provisions are typically based on our standard acceptance provision  which provides the customer with a right to a refund if the arrangement is terminated because the product did not meet our published specifications 
this right generally expires days after installation 
the product is deemed accepted unless the customer notifies the company otherwise 
generally  we determine that these acceptance provisions are not substantive and historically have not been exercised  and therefore should be accounted for as a warranty in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
at the time we enter into an arrangement  we assess the probability of collection of the fee and the terms granted to the customer 
the company s typical payment terms include a deposit and subsequent payments based on specific milestone events and dates 
our payment terms are less than days and typically amounts are due within days of invoice date 
if we consider the payment terms for the arrangement to be extended or if the arrangement includes a substantive acceptance provision  we defer revenue not meeting the criterion for recognition under sop and classify this revenue as deferred revenue  including deferred product revenue 
we recognize deferred revenue  assuming all other conditions for revenue recognition have been satisfied  when the payment of the arrangement fee becomes due and or when the uncertainty regarding acceptance is resolved as generally evidenced by written acceptance or payment of the arrangement fee 
additionally  we periodically enter into certain long term contracts where we generally recognize revenue on a percentage of completion basis using labor input measures 
we recognize losses  if any  on fixed price contracts when the loss is determined 
we record revenue in excess of billings on long term service contracts as unbilled receivables and include in trade accounts receivable 
we record billings in excess of revenue recognized on service contracts as deferred income until revenue recognition criteria are met 
allowance for doubtful accounts idx maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
we base this allowance on estimates after consideration of factors such as the composition of the accounts receivable aging and bad debt history and our evaluation of the financial condition of the customers 
if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances and bad debt expense may be required 
we typically do not require collateral 
historically  our estimates have been adequate to cover accounts receivable exposures 
capitalization of software development costs we expense all costs incurred in the research  design and development of software for sale to others until technological feasibility is established 
technological feasibility is established when planning  designing  coding and testing activities have been completed so that the working model is consistent with the product design as confirmed by testing 
thereafter  we capitalize and amortize software development costs to software development expense on a straight line basis over the lesser of months or the estimated lives of the respective products  beginning when the products are offered for sale 
we expense costs incurred in the development of software for internal use until it becomes probable that these developments will provide additional functionality that will benefit future periods 
thereafter  we capitalize and 
table of contents amortize certain costs to operating expense on a straight line basis over the lesser of five years or the estimated economic life of the software 
while we believe that our current estimates and the underlying assumptions regarding capitalized software development costs are appropriate  future events could necessitate adjustments to these estimates resulting in additional software development expense in the period of adjustment 
income taxes our valuation allowance relating to the net deferred tax assets is based on our assessment of historical pre tax income as well as tax planning strategies designed to generate future taxable income 
these strategies include estimates and involve judgment relating to certain unrealized gains in the company s investment in common stock of an equity investee 
to the extent that facts and circumstances change  these tax planning strategies may no longer be sufficient to support the deferred tax assets and the company may be required to increase the valuation allowance 
to the extent that we generate future taxable income against which these tax assets may be applied  some portion or all of the valuation allowance would be reversed and an increase in net income would consequently be reported in future years 
restructuring and lease abandonment charges the company has recorded restructuring and lease abandonment charges associated with restructuring plans approved by management over the last three years 
these reserves include estimates pertaining to employee separation costs and real estate lease obligations 
the reserve associated with lease obligations could be materially affected by factors such as the ability to obtain subleases  the creditworthiness of sub lessees  market value of properties  and the ability to negotiate early termination agreements with lessors 
while the company believes that its current estimates regarding lease obligations are adequate  future events could necessitate significant adjustments to these estimates 
accounting for litigation  commitments and contingencies we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings  which  if unfavorably determined  could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
in connection with our assessment of these legal proceedings  we must determine if an unfavorable outcome is probable and evaluate the costs for resolution of these matters  if reasonably estimable 
we have developed these determinations and related estimates in consultation with outside counsel handling our defense in these matters and is based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and defense strategies 
see item legal proceedings and note to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result
