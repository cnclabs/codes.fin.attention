the company generated million of net cash from operations during the year ended december  compared to million during the same prior year period 
despite a net loss in  depreciation and amortization expense of million and a decrease in accounts receivables of million contributed to the positive cash flow from operations 
during  based upon a periodic review of long lived assets for impairment in conjunction with a review of the company s marketing programs and product mix  certain expenditures incurred for property expansion plans  that were included in construction in progress  were determined to be unusable and resulted in a loss on asset impairment in the amount of million 
investing activities capital expenditures at the sands for the year ended december  amounted to approximately million 
in order to enhance its competitive position in the market place  the sands may determine to incur additional substantial costs and expenses to maintain  improve and expand its facilities and operations 
management anticipates that capital expenditures for will be approximately million 
the company may require additional financing in connection with those activities 
the sands is required by the casino act to make certain quarterly deposits based on gross revenue with the casino reinvestment development authority crda in lieu of a certain investment alternative tax 
deposits for the year ended december  amounted to million 
the sands has agreed to contribute certain of its future investment obligations to the crda in connection with the renovation related to the atlantic city boardwalk convention center 
the projected total contribution will amount to million  which will be paid through based on an estimate of certain of the sands future crda deposit obligations 
as of december   the sands had satisfied million of this obligation 
financing activities during  the company repaid  in long term debt 
there were no other financing activities during the year ended december  as of december  the only scheduled payment of long term debt is the million for new notes  due september  summary management believes that cash flows generated from operations during  as well as available cash reserves  will be sufficient to meet its operating plan and provide for scheduled capital expenditures 
however  any significant other capital expenditures may require additional financing 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its results of operations and financial condition are based upon its consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates may form the basis of the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities and may not be readily apparent from other sources 
actual results  under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed  may differ from estimates 
the impact and any associated risks related to estimates  assumptions  and accounting policies are discussed within management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition  as well as in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  if applicable  where such estimates  assumptions  and accounting policies affect the company s reported and expected financial results 
the company believes the following accounting policies are critical to its business operations and the understanding of results of operations and affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains accounts receivable allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the adequacy of the allowance is determined by management based on a periodic review of the receivable portfolio 
additional allowances may be required if the financial condition of the company s customers deteriorates 
commitments and contingencies litigation on an ongoing basis  the company assesses the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against the company 
while it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of such actions  the company uses its best judgment to determine if it is probable that it will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of such matters and whether a reasonable estimation of such probable loss  if any  can be made 
in assessing probable losses  the company makes estimates of the amount of insurance recoveries  if any 
the company accrues a liability when it believes a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recovery  it is possible that certain matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that the company has previously made 
impairment of long lived assets the company periodically reviews long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
assumptions and estimates used in the determination of impairment losses  such as future cash flows and disposition costs  may affect the carrying value of long lived assets and possible impairment expense in the company s consolidated financial statements 
self insurance the company retains the obligation for certain losses related to customer s claims of personal injuries incurred while on the company property 
the company accrues for outstanding reported claims  claims that have been incurred but not reported and projected claims based upon management s estimates of the aggregate liability for uninsured claims using historical experience  an adjusting company s estimates and the estimated trends in claim values 
although management believes it has the ability to adequately project and record estimated claim payments  it is possible that actual results could differ significantly from the recorded liabilities 
allowance for obligatory investments the company maintains obligatory investment allowances for its investments made in satisfaction of its crda obligation 
the obligatory investments may ultimately take the form of crda issued bonds  which bear interest at below market rates  direct investments or donations 
crda bonds bear interest at approximately one third below market rates 
management bases its reserves on the type of investments the obligation has taken or is expected to take 
donations of the sands quarterly deposits to the crda have historically yielded a future credit or refund of obligations 
therefore  management has reserved the predominant balance of its obligatory investments at between and
