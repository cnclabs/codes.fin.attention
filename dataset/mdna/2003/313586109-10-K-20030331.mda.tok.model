maturities 
fannie mae purchases conventional  single family fixed rate mortgages with original maturities of up to years and conventional  single family adjustable rate mortgages arms with maturities of up to years 
only a small portion of arms we purchase have maturities of more than years 
the multifamily mortgage loans we purchase generally are fixed rate loans with maturities of up to years 
payment structure  balloon payments 
the majority of fixed rate mortgage loans we purchase provide for equal or level monthly installments of principal and interest 
some of these loans have larger or balloon payments due   or years after origination  but with monthly payments based on longer eg  year amortization schedules 
most of the year balloon single family mortgage loans permit the borrower to refinance the balloon payment at maturity with a year fixed rate mortgage loan if certain requirements are satisfied 
many of the multifamily mortgage loans have balloon payments due    or years after origination  but with payments based on or year amortization schedules 
adjustable rate mortgage loans 
the interest rates on arms are determined by formulas providing for automatic adjustment  up or down  at specified intervals in accordance with changes in specified indices 
fixed period arms have an interest rate that is fixed for the first to years  and is adjusted at specified intervals after the initial period 
the payments of interest  or principal and interest  on substantially all arms adjust up or down after the interest rate on the loan is adjusted because of changes in the applicable index 
we currently purchase single family arms only if the arms limit the amount the interest rate may change over the life of the loan 
we purchase a small amount of arms that may permit negative amortization 
we generally require that those loans be reamortized at least annually to limit the amount of negative amortization that may accrue 
we also purchase certain arms  called reverse mortgages  that provide for periodic installments of principal to be paid to the borrower 
over the life of these loans  interest and certain other fees accrue on the balance of the payments made to the borrower 
generally  the loan is due when the borrower no longer occupies the property 
we currently purchase reverse mortgages only if the reverse mortgages are subject to a limit on the amount the interest rate may change over the life of the loan 
most of the reverse mortgages we purchase are guaranteed by the federal government 
liquid investment portfolio the liquid investment portfolio serves principally as a source of liquidity and an investment vehicle for our surplus capital 
if our access to the debt capital markets is ever impeded  we first will utilize assets in our liquid investment portfolio to generate cash to meet our liquidity needs 
we may use funds received at maturity of the short term investments in the portfolio or sell assets from the portfolio to generate those funds 
the liquid investment portfolio primarily invests in high quality securities that are readily marketable or have short term maturities 
the liquid investment portfolio does not invest in mortgage loans or mortgage related securities 
we have set a goal to maintain liquid assets equal to at least percent of total on balance sheet assets 
our ratio of liquid assets to total assets at december  and was percent and percent  
table of contents respectively 
because our liquid assets are maintained for liquidity purposes and not principally as an investment business  the income generated from these investments is considerably lower than the income generated by mortgage portfolio investments

credit guaranty business overview 
our credit guaranty business has primary responsibility for managing our mortgage credit risk 
credit risk is the risk of nonpayment by borrowers and counterparties 
the primary source of income for the credit guaranty business is fees we receive for our guaranty of the timely payment of scheduled principal and interest on mbs that are held by other investors  less the cost of providing this service 
in addition  the portfolio investment business compensates the credit guaranty business  for segment reporting purposes  through a fee comparable to an mbs guaranty fee 
consequently  we generally allocate mortgage credit expenses  including credit losses  to the credit guaranty business for business segment reporting purposes 
the credit guaranty business also provides investment capital to the portfolio investment business for which it is allocated income  and earns interest income on the temporary investment of principal and interest payments on mortgage loans underlying mbs prior to remittance to investors 
our credit guaranty business manages fannie mae s mortgage credit risk through sound asset acquisition practices  use of credit enhancements  active management of the credit book of business  and aggressive problem loan management 
we share mortgage credit risk with third parties as an integral part of our risk management strategy 
in our credit enhancement arrangements  we bear institutional counterparty risk that the parties assuming credit enhancement obligations may be unable to meet their contractual obligations 
mortgage credit enhancements are primarily mortgage insurance  lender recourse  and other risk sharing contracts 
we routinely monitor the risks associated with credit enhancement and other risk sharing arrangements 
we have provided a detailed description of how we manage the mortgage related credit risk associated with the credit guaranty business  as well as other types of credit risk  in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk management credit risk management 
the following diagram illustrates the basic structure of how we create a typical mbs in the case where a lender chooses to sell the mbs to a third party 

table of contents mbs guaranty process mbs 
we create both single class and multi class mbs 
the mbs represent beneficial interests in pools of mortgage loans or in other mortgage related securities 
the mbs  and the mortgage loans and mortgage related securities backing mbs  are not assets of fannie mae  except when we acquire them for mortgage portfolio investment purposes 
we create mbs backed by mortgage loans bearing interest at either fixed or adjustable rates  and secured by first or subordinate liens on either single family or multifamily residential properties 
mortgage loans can be either conventional mortgage loans or government guaranteed or insured mortgage loans 
conventional single family and multifamily loans are subject to the underwriting guidelines applicable to our loan purchases 
the majority of our outstanding mbs represent beneficial interests in conventional fixed rate first mortgage loans secured by single family dwellings 
we are the trustee for each trust and hold the underlying mortgage loans or mortgage related securities separate and apart from our assets  for the benefit of the certificateholders 
single class mbs 
single class mbs are mbs that are typically created through single lender transactions in which a lender delivers mortgage loans in exchange for mbs representing beneficial interests in those mortgage loans and our guaranty 
another form of single class mbs  referred to as fannie majors  allows multiple lenders to pool mortgage loans that are delivered to us and  in exchange  receive mbs representing each lender s proportionate share of the larger pool 
we also create single class mbs referred to as fannie megas or megas 
megas are pass through certificates backed by pooled multiple single class mbs with similar characteristics and or other pooled megas with similar characteristics 
megas are issued in transactions in which a lender or investment banker exchanges pooled single class mbs and or other pooled megas for newly issued mega certificates 

table of contents principal and interest from the mortgage loans underlying the single class mbs are passed through to the certificateholders less a fee for servicing the mortgage loans and a fee for our guaranty 
we guarantee the timely payment of scheduled principal due on the underlying mortgage loans and interest at the mbs pass through rate to the certificateholders  even if we have not received the payments on the underlying mortgage loans 
in other words  through our guaranty to certificateholders  we assume the credit risk of borrower defaults on the underlying mortgage loans  as well as any risk arising from a default or bankruptcy of the seller and servicer of the loans 
we have a responsibility to certificateholders for the servicing of the mortgage loans underlying the mbs and certain other mortgage related securities  although we do not directly service the mortgage loans 
see item business fannie mae business standards servicing arrangements 
we are also responsible for certain administrative functions  such as the collection and receipt of payments from the contract servicer  maintaining accounting records for each trust  and for the distribution of payments and reports due to certificateholders 
the mbs tba market 
single class mbs outstanding constituted approximately percent of fannie mae s total mbs outstanding as of december  the vast majority of these mbs are sold by lenders into the tba to be announced securities market 
a tba trade represents a contract for the purchase or sale of single family mortgage related securities to be delivered at a future agreed upon date 
the specific pool numbers that will be delivered to fulfill the trade obligation or terms of the contract are unknown at the time of the trade 
parties to a tba trade agree upon the issuer and product type to be delivered denoted by a pool prefix  the coupon or interest rate of the security to be delivered  the settlement date of the trade  the amount of securities to be delivered  and the price of those securities 
the single class mbs that ultimately will be delivered  and the loans backing that mbs  frequently have not been created or originated at the time of the tba trade  even though a price for the securities is agreed to at that time 
a tba trade may be entered into as much as several months before actual settlement of that trade 
tba sales enable the originating lender to hedge its interest rate risk and lock in interest rates for mortgage loan applicants throughout the loan origination process 
a lender may satisfy its delivery requirement under a tba trade by delivering any mortgage related security meeting the agreed upon terms 
multi class mbs 
we also create and guarantee multi class mbs  such as real estate mortgage investment conduits  commonly referred to as remics  certain grantor trust certificates  and stripped mortgage backed certificates  commonly referred to as smbs 
remics are a vehicle by which an issuer can restructure interest and principal payments on mortgage assets into separately tradeable interests 
by redirecting the cash flows from the underlying mortgage assets  we can create a security having several classes  also called tranches  which  among other things  may have different coupon rates  average lives  repayment sensitivities and final maturities 
smbs operate in a manner similar to remics  though we typically use smbs to create tranches that pay only principal or only interest 
we generally receive one time fees for swapping mortgage loans  mbs and other mortgage related securities for our multi class mbs 
if the multi class mbs are backed by whole loans or securities we have not already guaranteed  we may receive a guaranty fee in addition to a transaction fee 
we otherwise receive no separate guaranty fees for these transactions because we have already assumed the credit risk on the underlying securities and receive guaranty fees for that assumption on the underlying securities 
multi class mbs provide a variety of cash flow options for investors 
in multi class mbs  each class is entitled to different cash flows 
for example  these cash flows may consist of principal only payments from the underlying mortgage loans  interest only payments from the underlying mortgage loans  or different percentages of principal and interest payments 
in addition  the timing of payments may vary among the classes of remic certificates 
for example  a remic class may receive payments for only a limited period during the life of the trust 
our multi class mbs may be backed directly by mortgage loans or by other mortgage related securities  including single class mbs  remic certificates  grantor trust certificates  or mortgage related securities of an issuer other than fannie mae 
in general  our guaranty for multi class mortgage related securities covers timely payment of scheduled principal and interest due on these certificates and ultimate payment of principal by the date specified for each class of certificates 
we have created a limited number of subordinated remic classes that are not guaranteed by fannie mae 
most fannie mae 
table of contents multi class mortgage related securities are created in transactions in which an investment banker  or less frequently a lender or a mortgage banker  exchanges mortgage loans or mortgage related securities  or a combination of both  for the newly issued fannie mae multi class mbs 
guaranty fees 
we receive guaranty fees for our guaranty of timely payment of scheduled principal and interest on mbs 
when we create an mbs  we establish a guaranty fee for the mbs  taking into consideration the credit risk associated with the loans backing the mbs 
we either determine a weighted average guaranty fee based on the characteristics of the loans in the trust and assign that fee to each loan in the trust or assign each loan in the trust a guaranty fee based on its risk characteristics 
in the latter instance  our weighted average guaranty fee for the mbs may increase or decrease over time depending upon prepayment activity 
guaranty fees generally are paid to us on a monthly basis from a portion of the interest payments received on the underlying mortgage loans  as long as the loans are in the mbs 
guaranty fees are typically calculated for mbs at the loan level as a percent of the unpaid principal balance remaining on a loan 
the monthly guaranty fee may be adjusted up or down through a cash payment to or from the lender at the time the mbs is issued 
the aggregate amount of guaranty fees we receive in any financial statement period depends primarily upon the amount of fannie mae mbs outstanding during that financial statement period and on the applicable guaranty fee rates 
the amount of mbs outstanding is influenced by factors including the rates at which the underlying mortgage loans are repaid  the rate of defaults on loans or breaches of lender representations resulting in repurchases from the pool  and the rate at which we issue new mbs and purchase or sell mbs in our mortgage portfolio business 
in general  when prevailing interest rates decline below the interest rates on loans underlying outstanding mbs  both the rate of mortgage loan prepayments and the issuance of new mbs are likely to increase 
conversely  when interest rates rise above the interest rates on mortgage loans underlying our outstanding mbs  the rate of mortgage loan prepayments and new mbs issuance is likely to slow 
the rate of principal prepayments also is influenced by a variety of economic  demographic  and other factors 
delinquencies and reo 
we manage loans in partnership with our servicers to minimize the frequency of foreclosure and the severity of loss in the event of foreclosure 
when a loan is in default  generally the servicer takes appropriate loss mitigation steps or  if necessary  pursues foreclosure on behalf of fannie mae 
if a mortgage is liquidated through foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure we would acquire the underlying property as real estate owned  or reo and attempt to sell the reo 
if the defaulted loan backs an mbs  we may repurchase the loan out of the mbs trust and pay the principal balance on the loan to the mbs certificateholders when the loan is delinquent by four or more consecutive monthly payments or eight biweekly installments 
this is generally our current practice given the level of interest rates  because it is often less expensive for us to fund the purchase of the loan at our lower borrowing cost than to continue to pass through to the investor the coupon rate of the mbs 
we have a policy to repurchase the loan if it is delinquent by twenty four consecutive months or at the time of foreclosure  if it is still in the mbs trust at that time 
as long as the loan or reo remains in the mbs trust  we continue to pay scheduled principal and interest to the certificateholders and defer payment of the remaining principal balance until the earlier of the repurchase of the loan from the mbs trust  the sale of the reo or the third year following foreclosure 
the level of delinquencies and number of reo are affected by economic conditions  loss mitigation efforts which include contacting delinquent borrowers to offer a repayment plan  loan modification  preforeclosure sale  or other options  contractual provisions in credit enhancements  and a variety of other factors 
we manage the risk of delinquencies and reo  including the risk on loans and mortgage related securities held in our mortgage portfolio  as described in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk management credit risk management 
fee based services we offer services to lenders and other customers in return for fees 
these include transaction fees for issuing and administering remics  smbs  fannie megas and certain grantor trust securities  and facilitating securities transactions 

table of contents we also receive fee income in return for providing technology related services  such as desktop underwriter  desktop originator  and other on line services 
these services provide lenders the ability to underwrite mortgage loans electronically  communicate with third party originators  access our loan pricing schedules  and enter into sale commitments with us on a real time basis 
we also facilitate securities transactions for customers 
for this service  we may earn a spread on the purchase and sale of mbs and certain other mortgage related securities  such as ginnie mae certificates  or may receive a fee from the customer 
in addition  we receive fee income through other activities  such as providing credit enhancements and other investment alternatives for customers 
housing goals the federal housing enterprises financial safety and soundness act the act requires the secretary of the us department of housing and urban development hud to establish a low and moderate income  an underserved areas  and a special affordable housing goal for loans purchased or guaranteed by fannie mae 
we are required to submit an annual report to the house committee on financial services  the senate committee on banking  housing and urban affairs  and the secretary of hud regarding our performance in meeting the housing goals 
by regulation  hud has established the low and moderate income housing goal at percent of the total number of dwelling units financed by eligible mortgage purchases annually  the underserved areas housing goal at percent  and the special affordable housing goal  a more targeted measure  at percent 
eligible mortgage purchases include mbs guarantees but exclude several activities  including the purchase or guaranty of non conventional mortgages and mortgages on second homes  commitments to purchase or guarantee mortgages at a later date  and equity investments in low income housing tax credits 
for the year ended december   eligible mortgage purchases represented approximately of our business volume 
in addition  hud has established fannie mae s targeted multifamily subgoal at billion 
each of these goals applies annually during through if hud does not establish different goals for and after  the goals will continue at the current levels 
the goals also include certain provisions that reduce penalties for missing data and provide incentive points for serving small multifamily and owner occupied rental housing 
a loan may be counted in more than one category of goals 
if hud determines that fannie mae has failed to meet its housing goals and that achievement of the goals was feasible  taking into account market and economic conditions and fannie mae s financial condition  fannie mae must submit a housing plan to hud describing the actions it will take to meet the goal in the next calendar year 
if hud determines that fannie mae has failed to submit a housing plan or failed to make a good faith effort to comply with the plan  hud may take certain administrative actions 
the following table shows fannie mae s housing goals and results for the past three years 
housing goals goal result goal result goal result dollars in billions low and moderate income housing underserved areas special affordable housing multifamily minimum in special affordable housing goals are expressed as a percentage of the total number of dwelling units financed through eligible mortgage purchases during the period  except for the targeted multifamily goal 
competition in the case of single family mortgage loans  fannie mae competes  within the limits prescribed by the charter act  for the purchase of mortgage loans for our own portfolio  for the guaranty of mortgage credit risk  and for the issuance in the secondary mortgage market of mortgage related securities 
for single family products  we compete with freddie mac another government sponsored enterprise with a mission  authority  and regulatory oversight that are virtually identical to our own  commercial banks  savings and loan 
table of contents associations  savings banks  pension funds  insurance companies  securities dealers  and other financial entities that purchase single family mortgage loans or mortgage related securities for their own portfolio or pool single family mortgage loans for sale to investors as whole loans or mortgage related securities 
we compete with the federal home loan banks  which also finance single family mortgage loans through a variety of programs that were initiated in we compete with mortgage insurers  bond insurers  and other financial guarantors that provide mortgage credit guaranty services on loans and pools of loans 
commercial banks and thrifts are the largest participants in the us mortgage industry 
banks and thrifts originate mortgages which we are not empowered to do under the charter act  have access to low cost  fdic insured deposits and can borrow advances from federal home loan banks 
there has been significant consolidation among commercial banks and thrifts  increasing the size of individual organizations and resulting in concentration in the banking industry 
this has created larger institutions with the scale necessary to permit them to securitize their own mortgages and manage large and complex portfolios 
as institutions become larger  they have increasing bargaining power in their negotiations with fannie mae  and are able to offer us volume in return for lower guaranty fees and customization of services 
we compete with the fha insurance program  a program of hud  for the business of guaranteeing the credit performance of mortgage loans and  because of the eligibility of such fha insured loans for securitization by the government national mortgage association ginnie mae  an entity within hud  with ginnie mae as well 
the base maximum principal balance for loans eligible for the fha insurance program is percent of our loan limit 
the loan limit for fha insured loans in high cost areas is as much as percent of our limit 
these higher fha limits may result in increased competition for our credit guaranty business 
we compete primarily on the basis of price  products  structures  and services offered 
competition based on advances in technology related and other fee based services continues to increase  as do the types and nature of the products offered by us and other market participants 
our market share of loans purchased for cash or swapped for mortgage related securities is affected by the volume of mortgage loans offered for sale in the secondary market by loan originators and other market participants and the amount purchased by our competitors 
in the case of multifamily mortgage loans  we generally compete with government housing programs  freddie mac  insurance companies  and the same kinds of entities we compete with in the single family market 
in addition  there is competition for multifamily mortgage loans from certain entities typically sponsored by investment banks and commercial banks that purchase such loans and pool them for sale to investors in the commercial mortgage related securities market 
such entities are referred to as conduits  and their role in the multifamily mortgage market has increased significantly over the last five years 
conduits continue to be a strong source of competition 
competition is particularly intense for multifamily mortgage loans eligible for government subsidies  which have low income rent and occupancy restrictions 
commercial banks contemplating merger or expansion plans seek to fund such loans to secure favorable review under the community reinvestment act and may either hold such loans as an investment or sell them to a secondary market investor 
we compete for these investments in the secondary market to meet our housing goals 
under the act  the secretary of hud must approve any new fannie mae or freddie mac conventional mortgage program that is significantly different from those approved or engaged in prior to that act s enactment 
our ability to compete could be affected by this requirement 
see government regulation and charter act 
competition also is a consideration in connection with the issuance of fannie mae s debt securities 
we compete with freddie mac  the federal home loan bank system  and other government sponsored entities for funds raised through the issuance of unsecured debt in the agency debt market 
increases in the issuance of unsecured debt by other government sponsored entities generally  and in the issuance of callable debt in particular  may have an adverse effect on the issuance of our unsecured debt or result in the issuance of such debt at higher interest rates than would otherwise be the case 
in addition  the availability and cost of funds 
table of contents raised through the issuance of certain types of unsecured debt may be adversely affected by regulatory initiatives that may reduce investments by depository institutions in unsecured debt with greater than normal volatility or interest rate sensitivity 
employees as of february   fannie mae employed approximately  permanent personnel

we are also required to meet certain goals established by the secretary of hud to promote affordable housing and to serve the housing needs of those in underserved areas 
see business housing goals 
capital requirements the act established minimum capital  risk based capital  and critical capital requirements for fannie mae 
see also item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources capital resources regulatory environment 
ofheo issued a final rule in that sets forth the minimum capital requirements for fannie mae and freddie mac  which are to be calculated  reported  and classified on a quarterly basis 
we were in compliance with the minimum capital rule as of december   and have been in compliance for every reporting period since the rule became effective 
ofheo issued regulations in september  as subsequently amended  to establish a risk based capital test to be used to determine the amount of total capital fannie mae must hold to meet the risk based capital standard 
fannie mae and freddie mac are required to hold enough capital to withstand a severe year stress period  characterized by extreme interest rate movements and credit losses occurring simultaneously  plus percent of that amount for management and operations risk 
the risk based capital test evaluates combined interest rate and credit stress for both rising and declining interest rate scenarios 
the more stringent of these two scenarios determines the required risk based capital 
the test assumes that interest rates increase or decrease by up to basis points over the first year  and remain constant at this new level for the remaining years of the test  severe credit conditions apply nationwide  and we acquire no new business during this period except to meet outstanding mortgage commitments 
the regulations specify that benchmark loss experience will be combined with other assumptions and applied each quarter to our book of business to establish expected credit losses based on the stress assumptions under the risk based capital standard 
the regulations also specify the housing price index that ofheo will use in connection with the standard and how the test will be used to determine fannie mae s risk based capital requirements 
on march   ofheo announced that fannie mae complied with the risk based capital rule as of december  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources capital resources regulatory environment 
if we fail to meet the capital standards  ofheo is permitted or required to take remedial measures  depending on the standards we fail to meet

we are required to submit a capital restoration plan if we fail to meet any of the capital standards 
if ofheo determines that we are engaging in conduct not approved by the director that could result in a rapid depletion of core capital or that the value of the property subject to mortgages we hold or have securitized has decreased significantly  or if ofheo does not approve the capital restoration plan or determines that we have failed to make reasonable efforts to comply with the plan  ofheo may take remedial measures as if we were not meeting the capital standards we otherwise meet 
the act gives ofheo authority  after following prescribed procedures  to appoint a conservator if we do not meet the critical capital level 
dividend restrictions the charter act as amended by the act restricts the ability of our board of directors to make capital distributions  including any dividends  in the following circumstances fannie mae may not pay any dividend  without the approval of ofheo  if the dividend payment would decrease our total capital below the risk based capital level or our core capital below the minimum capital level 

table of contents if we do not meet the risk based capital standard but do meet the minimum capital standard  we may not make any dividend payment that would cause us to fail to meet the minimum capital standard 
if we meet neither the risk based capital standard nor the minimum capital standard but do meet the critical capital standard established under the act  we may make a dividend payment only if we would not fail to meet the critical capital standard as a result of the payment and the director of ofheo approves the payment after finding that the payment satisfies certain statutory conditions

table of contents organization of information management s discussion and analysis md a provides a narrative on fannie mae s financial performance and condition that should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements 
it includes the following sections overview about fannie mae results of operations core business earnings and business segment results off balance sheet transactions application of critical accounting policies risk management liquidity and capital resources performance outlook new accounting standards overview was a year of notable achievements for fannie mae 
we produced strong financial results and made continued progress on our key strategic initiatives in an uncertain economic environment marked by significant interest rate volatility and more intense competition for mortgages in the secondary market 
we reported net income of billion and diluted earnings per share diluted eps of in  compared with billion and in  and billion and in our reported results are based on generally accepted accounting principles gaap  which include the effects of our january  adoption of financial accounting standard no 
fas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
fas generates significant volatility in our reported net income because it requires that we record in our income changes in the time value portion of purchased options that we use to manage interest rate risk  but it does not allow us to record in earnings changes in the intrinsic value portion of some of those options or similar changes in the fair value of options in all of our callable debt or mortgage assets 
we expect purchased options expense to vary  often substantially  from period to period with changes in interest rates  expected interest rate volatility  and derivative activity 
the percent decrease in our net income resulted primarily from a billion increase in purchased options expense  which occurred due to an increase in the notional amount of purchased options outstanding and the declining interest rate environment 
we recorded billion in purchased options expense in  compared with million in excluding the impact of purchased options expense  we experienced solid growth in our business operations 
taxable equivalent net interest income increased percent over because of strong growth in our average net mortgage portfolio and actions taken during and to lower our debt costs 
guaranty fee income increased percent  primarily due to an increase in the volume of outstanding mbs 
these increases were partially offset by a modest rise in credit related expenses and higher administrative expenses and losses on debt extinguishments 
management also tracks and analyzes fannie mae s financial results based on a supplemental non gaap measure called core business earnings previously referred to by us as operating net income 
while core business earnings is not a substitute for gaap net income  we rely on core business earnings in operating our business because we believe core business earnings provides our management and investors with a better measure of our financial results and better reflects our risk management strategies than our gaap net income 
we developed core business earnings in conjunction with our january  adoption of fas to adjust for accounting differences between alternative transactions we use to hedge interest rate risk that produce similar economic results but require different accounting treatment under fas for example  our 
table of contents core business earnings measure allows management and investors to evaluate the quality of earnings from fannie mae s principal business activities in a way that accounts for comparable hedging transactions in a similar manner 
we discuss our core business earnings results in md a core business earnings and business segment results 
while the overall us economy was weak during  the us housing market remained strong  with both home sales and mortgage originations reaching record levels 
the decline in mortgage interest rates during the third quarter of to the lowest levels since the s sparked a refinance boom and fueled record refinance as well as purchase originations 
single family mortgage originations in totaled trillion  surpassing s record of trillion by percent 
our market residential mortgage debt outstanding increased percent in to trillion as the demand for housing continued to grow  marking the first two consecutive years of double digit residential mortgage debt outstanding mdo growth since during  we made progress on several key strategic initiatives to support our mission of increasing homeownership and affordable rental housing for all americans 
we align our strategies with and measure our performance against six long term corporate goals 
acknowledged leadership in increasing access to affordable housing one of our most significant initiatives to increase homeownership rates and serve million targeted american families is our ten year  trillion american dream commitment 
in  we provided billion for million targeted families to own or rent a home  bringing us almost two thirds of the way toward achieving this ten year goal in three years 
leading presence in the secondary market and partner of choice our goal is to be the secondary market partner of choice for mortgage lenders 
we now have alliance agreements with of the largest lenders  and our business with smaller lenders has grown by over percent during the past year 
we achieved a net gain in major partnership accounts during we have provided increased liquidity to mortgage markets by owning approximately percent of mortgage debt outstanding and guaranteeing percent owned by other investors 
optimal risk management our financial success depends on the ability of our two core lines of business to effectively manage interest rate risk and credit risk on home mortgages 
by taking an active  highly disciplined approach in managing these risks  we have honed our risk management tools over the years to reduce our risk exposure  expand our service to american homebuyers  and deliver double digit core business earnings growth for the last years through all kinds of economic scenarios 
record financial performance one of our key financial performance goals  announced in  is a five year goal to double fannie mae s core business diluted earnings per share to by the end of with an increase in core business earnings of nearly percent over the last years  we are on track to achieve this five year goal 
corporate culture to enhance strategy execution developing a corporate culture that ensures a diverse and fully engaged workforce is critical in executing our key strategic initiatives and fulfilling fannie mae s mission to help more families achieve the american dream of homeownership 
in  fannie mae received several awards in recognition of our commitment to being a world class  diverse organization 
e commerce company infrastructure to increase capabilities and lower costs our e commerce strategy is intended to help us grow our business  while lowering the cost of mortgages and reducing our underwriting risk 
for example  by expanding utilization of desktop underwriter du  our automated underwriting system  we can help lenders streamline their processes and enhance further our credit risk management effectiveness 
today  approximately percent of our total single family business is processed through du 
in addition  we committed significant resources in to upgrading our core technology infrastructure to enhance the acquisition of mortgages through multiple channels  facilitate new products  and generate cost reductions for our customers 

table of contents because of fannie mae s critical role in the housing finance system  one of our core commitments is to maintain the highest standard of transparency in our financial disclosures 
in our on going efforts to enhance fannie mae s transparency  we announced in our voluntary initiative to register fannie mae s common stock with the securities and exchange commission under section g of the securities exchange act of this report is our first periodic report filed pursuant to our voluntary initiative 
about fannie mae fannie mae s purpose is to facilitate the flow of low cost mortgage capital to increase the availability and affordability of homeownership for low  moderate  and middle income americans 
we operate under a federal charter  and our primary regulator is the office of federal housing enterprise oversight ofheo 
however  we are a private  shareholder owned company 
the us government does not guarantee  directly or indirectly  fannie mae s debt securities or other obligations 
as the nation s largest source of funds for mortgage lenders and investors  fannie mae provides resources for our customers to make additional mortgage loans or investments in mortgage related securities 
we provide liquidity to the mortgage market for the benefit of borrowers  however  we do not lend money directly to consumers 
we operate exclusively in the secondary mortgage market by purchasing mortgages and mortgage related securities  including fannie mae mbs  from primary market institutions  such as commercial banks  savings and loan associations  mortgage companies  securities dealers  and other investors 
we provide additional liquidity in the secondary market by issuing and guaranteeing mortgage related securities 
we have two lines of business that generate revenue 
these business lines also focus on managing our key business risks 
we measure the results of our lines of business based on core business earnings 
we evaluate the results of our business lines as though each were a stand alone business 
hence  we allocate certain income and expenses to each line of business for purposes of business segment reporting 
we eliminate certain inter segment allocations in our consolidated core business earnings results see md a core business earnings and business segment results 
portfolio investment business the portfolio investment business has two principal components a mortgage portfolio and a liquid investment portfolio lip 
the mortgage portfolio purchases mortgage loans  mortgage related securities  and other investments from lenders  securities dealers  investors  and other market participants 
the lip serves as an alternative source of funds to meet our cash flow needs by investing in high quality  short term investments that provide an ongoing supply of funds 
we can use these funds as necessary for liquidity purposes or to reinvest in readily marketable  high credit quality securities that can be sold to raise cash 
we fund the purchase of the assets in our portfolio investment business from our equity capital and by issuing debt in the global capital markets 
the portfolio investment business generates profits by ensuring that the interest income from the mortgages  mbs  mortgage related securities  and liquid investments we purchase is greater than our borrowing costs 
a primary measure of profitability for the portfolio investment business is our net interest margin 
our net interest margin reflects the difference between taxable equivalent income on our mortgage assets and non mortgage investments and our borrowing expense divided by average interest earning assets 
our portfolio investment business focuses on managing fannie mae s interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is the risk that changes in interest rates could change cash flows on our mortgage assets and debt in a way that adversely affects fannie mae s earnings or long term value 
credit guaranty business our credit guaranty business has primary responsibility for managing all of our mortgage credit risk 
credit risk is the risk of loss to future earnings and future cash flows that may result from the failure of a borrower or counterparty to fulfill its contractual obligation to fannie mae 
the credit guaranty business primarily generates income from guaranty fees for guaranteeing the timely payment of scheduled principal and interest on mortgage related securities we guarantee that are not owned by the portfolio investment business 
the primary source of income for the credit guaranty business is the 
table of contents difference between the guaranty fees earned and the costs of providing this service 
income is also allocated to the credit guaranty business for the following activities managing the credit risk on mortgage related assets held by the portfolio investment business 
the portfolio investment business compensates the credit guaranty business through a guaranty fee comparable to an mbs guaranty fee 
these fees are recognized as guaranty fee income by the credit guaranty business 
similarly  all credit expenses  including credit losses on loans and on mbs and other mortgage related securities held in fannie mae s mortgage portfolio  are allocated to the credit guaranty business for business segment reporting purposes 
net interest income for the credit guaranty business is net of charges paid to the portfolio investment business for forgone interest on delinquent loans 
providing capital to the portfolio investment business 
the portfolio investment business also compensates the credit guaranty business for the temporary use of capital generated by the credit guaranty business  which the portfolio investment business uses to fund investments 
this compensation is classified as net interest income 
temporarily investing principal and interest payments on loans underlying mbs and other mortgage related securities prior to remittance to investors 
interest income on the temporary investment of these funds is allocated to the credit guaranty business 
our credit guaranty business manages fannie mae s mortgage credit risk by managing the profile and quality of mortgages in the mortgage credit book of business  using credit enhancements to reduce our losses  assessing the sensitivity of credit losses to changes in economic conditions  and aggressively managing problem assets to mitigate losses 
revenue growth in our business lines is driven fundamentally by growth in residential mortgage debt outstanding 
this market has usually been one of the strongest growth markets in the us economy  typically growing faster than the gross domestic product gdp 
during the s  mortgage debt outstanding grew percent annually 
since  mdo has grown at an average annual rate of percent 
our economic projections indicate an average annual growth rate of to percent during the current decade due to four fundamental demographic and economic drivers projected growth in immigration  population  and household formation  increased rates of homeownership particularly by minorities  whose homeownership rates lag the average by percentage points  continued growth in property values as the average home grows larger  demand remains strong  and supply remains constrained because of land shortages and growth restrictions  and projected growth in debt to value ratios as consumers increasingly use the equity in their homes as a financial investment option 
in addition  our business has typically grown faster than our market because of our efficiency  innovation  and low costs  which have helped make fannie mae a preferred source of liquidity for fixed rate mortgages 
the expenses related to our lines of business stem largely from costs incurred to manage our two primary business risks interest rate risk and credit risk 
we have highly skilled teams of experienced risk management professionals who take an active  highly disciplined approach in managing these risks to meet our objective of delivering consistent earnings growth and target returns on capital in a wide range of economic environments 
they have been successful in dispersing fannie mae s risk and loss exposure over the years within the global financial system by developing various mortgage risk management tools that increase our level of expertise and efficiency in managing mortgage prepayment and credit risk 
results of operations the following discussion of our results of operations is based on fannie mae s reported results 
we have reclassified certain amounts in our prior years reported results to conform to our current presentation 
we provide a separate discussion of our core business earnings and business segment results in md a core business earnings and business segment results 

table of contents net interest income reported net interest income is the difference between interest income and interest expense 
net interest income represents a principal source of earnings for fannie mae and is affected by net volume  asset yield  and the cost of debt and certain derivatives 
reported net interest income subsequent to our adoption of fas only includes a portion of the cost associated with using purchased options to hedge the borrowers prepayment option in mortgages 
prior to the adoption of fas  we amortized purchased options premiums on a straight line basis and reflected the cost in our net interest income as a component of our interest expense 
with the adoption of fas  we now report the change in the fair value of the time value of purchased options in a separate income statement category purchased options expense 
we also present net interest income and the related net interest yield on a taxable equivalent basis to consistently reflect income from taxable and tax exempt investments based on a percent marginal tax rate 
table presents fannie mae s net interest yield based on our reported net interest income adjusted for tax exempt investments and average balances of mortgage assets  nonmortgage investments  and debt

averages have been calculated on a monthly basis based on amortized cost 
includes average balance of nonaccrual loans of billion in  billion in  and billion in interest free funds represent the portion of our investment portfolio funded by equity and non interest bearing liabilities 

table of contents taxable equivalent net interest income totaled billion in  compared with billion in and billion in the increase of billion  or percent  in taxable equivalent net interest income was due primarily to percent growth in our average net mortgage portfolio and a higher net interest yield  which was favorably affected by the low interest rate environment and unusually steep yield curve 
as mortgage interest rates fell to the lowest level in years and fixed rate mortgage originations reached record levels  we took advantage of opportunities to grow our mortgage portfolio at attractive spreads relative to our debt costs 
our net interest yield continued to benefit and remained elevated during because of actions we took during and to lower our debt costs by calling or retiring higher cost debt and temporarily replacing it with shorter term  lower cost debt 
during  taxable equivalent net interest income increased billion or percent over  partially due to the effect of the change in accounting for our purchased options under fas our taxable equivalent net interest income in does not include all of the cost of purchased options 
however  our taxable equivalent net interest income in includes million of expense related to the amortization of purchased options premiums on a straight line basis 
prior to the adoption of fas  we recorded purchased options premiums as interest expense in our reported net interest income 
fas changed our accounting for purchased options  requiring that we report changes in the fair value of the time value of purchased options instead of expensing purchased options premiums on a straight line basis 
we report changes in the fair value of the time value of our purchased options in a separate income statement category purchased options expense 
our taxable equivalent net interest income in also benefited from percent growth in our average net mortgage portfolio and a significant decrease in our debt costs that elevated our net interest yield 
a reduction in intermediate term rates during boosted mortgage refinancings and originations  fueling an increase in the supply of mortgage assets in the secondary market and attractive mortgage to debt spreads

guaranty fee income guaranty fee income reported in our total corporate results and our average guaranty fee rate primarily include guaranty fees we receive on mortgage related securities we issue that are held by other investors 
we classify guaranty fees on fannie mae mortgage related securities held in our portfolio as net interest income 
the guaranty fee income allocated for line of business reporting purposes to the credit guaranty business on mortgage related securities held in our portfolio is eliminated by an equal and offsetting allocation of guaranty expense to the portfolio investment business 
we exclude the administrative costs of managing outstanding mbs and other mortgage related securities from guaranty fee income 
guaranty fee income increased percent or million in to billion and percent in to billion 
the increases were driven primarily by a percent increase in average outstanding mbs mbs and other mortgage related securities guaranteed by fannie mae and held by investors other than fannie mae during and a percent increase during our average guaranty fee rate on outstanding mbs during increased slightly to basis points from basis points in during the last half of  our average effective guaranty fee rate rose as a result of higher fee rates on new business and the faster amortization of deferred fees as we adjusted our prepayment amortization rates to reflect the acceleration of mortgage prepayments in the heavy refinance environment 
our average effective guaranty fee rate declined by 
basis points between and  primarily due to increased competition and general market conditions 
recently  rates on new credit guaranty products have been higher because of our efforts to better align our pricing with the relative underlying risks of loans we guarantee and expansion into market segments that demand higher guaranty fees 
as a result of these trends  we anticipate a modest increase in our average effective guaranty fee rates in the future 
table presents our average effective guaranty fee rate for the past three years 

table of contents table guaranty fee data year ended december  dollars in millions guaranty fee income average balance of outstanding mbs average effective guaranty fee rate basis points outstanding mbs refers to mbs and other mortgage related securities guaranteed by fannie mae and held by investors other than fannie mae 
if an mbs has been resecuritized into another mbs  we only include the principal amount once in the outstanding balance 
fee and other income expense  net fee and other income expense consists of transaction fees  technology fees  multifamily fees  and other miscellaneous items and is net of costs associated with the purchase of additional mortgage insurance to protect against credit losses credit enhancement expense and operating losses from certain tax advantaged investments in affordable housing projects 
these tax advantaged investments represent equity interests in limited partnerships that own rental housing and generate tax credits  which reduce fannie mae s effective federal income tax rate 
we account for the majority of these investments using the equity method 
we do not guarantee any obligations of these partnerships  and our exposure is limited to the amount of our investments 
we record the tax benefit related to these investments as a reduction in the provision for federal income taxes and as an increase in taxable equivalent revenues 
we recorded million of fee and other income in  up from million of income in the million increase in fee and other income was driven by a million increase in transaction and technology fees resulting primarily from increased remic transaction volumes and a million increase in net gains from the sale of securities 
these increases were offset partially by a million increase in credit enhancement expenses and a million increase in impairment write downs on a variety of investments 
the increase in credit enhancement expenses was attributable to an increase in the volume of business covered by credit enhancements purchased directly by fannie mae  stemming from our expansion into new products and markets 
fee and other income totaled million for  up million over expense of million recorded in primarily because of a million increase in technology and transaction fees 
the increase in technology and transaction fees resulted largely from greater use of fannie mae s desktop underwriter and desktop originator systems and higher structured transaction fees  such as remic fees  attributable to record mortgage business volumes 
a hedging loss on an anticipated benchmark notes issuance that occurred in april also contributed to the year over year increase in fee and other income in credit related expenses credit related expenses include foreclosed property expenses income and the provision for losses 
in  we reclassified recoveries in excess of charged off amounts on foreclosed properties from charge off recoveries to foreclosed property expense income 
in addition  with the rescission of the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position  accounting for foreclosed assets sop in the fourth quarter of  we now include estimated selling costs in the determination of our initial charge off when we foreclose on a loan 
we adjusted our provision for losses to reflect a charge equal to the net change in charge offs 
we have also retroactively reclassified any excess recoveries in previous periods for comparability purposes 
credit related expenses increased million over to million  primarily due to an increase in multifamily credit related losses stemming from two properties 
we recorded a provision for losses of million in  an increase of million over the increase in our provision was partially offset by million in additional foreclosed property income primarily due to gains on foreclosed property dispositions 
foreclosed property income totaled million in  compared with million in the 
table of contents increase in credit related expenses follows a million decline in that was largely due to a reduction in our provision for losses 
our provision for losses decreased million in to million 
we also had forgone interest on non performing assets that reduced our net interest income by million in  million in  and million in although foreclosed single family property acquisitions increased in to  from  in and  in  average severities declined due to strong home prices and credit enhancement proceeds 
we previously recorded gains from the sale of foreclosed properties and related mortgage insurance claims against our allowance for losses as a recovery of charge offs 
during  we reclassified these gains to foreclosed property expense income 
additionally  the aicpa rescinded sop during the fourth quarter of under sop  we recorded selling costs related to the disposition of foreclosed properties in our income statement under foreclosed property expense income 
we now include selling costs in our initial charge off estimate 
all prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation 
the reclassified amounts result in equal and offsetting changes to our provision for losses and foreclosed property expense income line items within our previously reported income statements 
these reclassifications have no impact on previously reported net income  total credit related expenses  total credit related losses  or the combined balance of the allowance for loan losses and guaranty liability 
despite significant growth in our book of business and overall weaker economic conditions during and  credit losses as a percentage of fannie mae s average book of business have steadily declined to 
basis points in  from 
basis points in  and 
basis points in our book of business includes mortgages and mbs in our mortgage portfolio and outstanding mbs held by other investors 
credit losses include charge offs net of recoveries and foreclosed property income 
the strong appreciation in home prices during and helped in strengthening the credit risk profile of our book of business 
in addition  we have been able to effectively manage credit risk by using credit enhancements to minimize our credit losses during the economic slowdown  monitoring and assessing the sensitivity of our credit risk to changes in the economic environment  and taking an aggressive approach to problem asset management 
administrative expenses administrative expenses include those costs incurred to run our daily operations  such as personnel costs and technology expenses 
administrative expenses increased percent to billion in the above average growth in administrative expenses was due primarily to costs incurred on a multi year project initiated in to re engineer our core infrastructure systems and expenses associated with relocating our primary data center 
in addition  compensation expense increased percent to million in  resulting primarily from a percent increase in the number of employees and annual salary increases 
administrative expenses grew percent to billion in from million in  primarily due to increased compensation expense related to percent growth in the number of employees and annual salary increases  increased costs related to the multi year core infrastructure project  and a contribution of million in to support victims and families of victims affected by the september tragedy 
we evaluate growth in administrative expenses based on growth in taxable equivalent revenues and our average book of business 
taxable equivalent revenues is a supplemental non gaap measure discussed further in md a core business earnings and business segment results 
while administrative expenses have grown in the past two years  the ratio of administrative expenses to taxable equivalent revenues  which we refer to as our efficiency ratio  has increased only modestly to percent from percent in our efficiency ratio for and remained fairly steady and improved over the percent level of primarily due to strong growth in net interest income during both years 
the ratio of administrative expenses to our average book of business has also remained relatively stable at 
percent in  compared with 
percent in  and 
percent in 
table of contents special contribution special contribution expense reflects a contribution we made to the fannie mae foundation 
we committed during the fourth quarter of to contribute million of our common stock to the fannie mae foundation 
the fannie mae foundation creates affordable homeownership and housing opportunities through innovative partnerships and initiatives that build healthy  vibrant communities across the united states 
it is a separate  private  nonprofit organization that we do not consolidate  but is supported solely by fannie mae 
we expect the contribution to the fannie mae foundation to reduce the foundation s need for contributions over the next several years 
we acquired the shares through open market purchases and contributed them to the foundation in the first quarter of purchased options expense purchased options expense includes the change in the fair value of the time value of purchased options in accordance with fas the change in the fair value of the time value of purchased options will vary from period to period with changes in interest rates  market pricing of options  and our derivative activity 
our reported income results for were unfavorably affected by billion in purchased options expense related to changes in the time value of purchased options  significantly more than the million expense recorded in the substantial increase in expense during was caused by an increase in the average notional balance of caps and swaptions  two types of purchased options we commonly use to manage interest rate risk  to billion in from billion in  coupled with a sharp decline in interest rates that resulted in a decrease in time value 
under fas  we are not allowed to recognize in earnings changes in the intrinsic value of some of these options  which  in combination with the fair value of options in our mortgage assets and callable debt  would have more than offset the decrease in the time value of these options during prior to the adoption of fas on january   we amortized premiums on purchased options into interest expense on a straight line basis 
in  we recorded million in purchased options amortization expense that is included as a component of net interest income 
during the fourth quarter of  we refined our methodology for estimating the initial time value of interest rate caps at the date of purchase and prospectively adopted a preferred method that resulted in a million pre tax reduction in purchased options expense and increased our diluted eps for by 
under our previous valuation method  we treated the entire premium paid on purchased at the money caps as time value with no allocation to intrinsic value 
our new methodology allocates the initial purchase price to reflect the value of individual caplets  some of which are above the strike rate of the cap  which results in a higher intrinsic value and corresponding lower time value at the date of purchase 
this approach is more consistent with our estimation of time value subsequent to the initial purchase date 
this change does not affect the total expense that will be recorded in our income statement over the life of our caps and has no effect on our non gaap core business earnings measure 
debt extinguishments fannie mae strategically repurchases or calls debt securities and related interest rate swaps on a regular basis as part of our interest rate risk management efforts and to reduce future debt costs 
we record gains and losses on debt extinguishments in this category 
we recognized a pre tax loss of million in from the call and repurchase of debt  compared with a pre tax loss of million in market conditions during and made it advantageous for us to repurchase billion and billion  respectively  of debt securities that were trading at historically wide spreads to other fixed income securities 
we also called over billion of high coupon debt securities and notional principal of interest rate swaps in and billion in the weighted average cost of redeemed debt and interest rate swaps in and was percent and percent  respectively 
during  we repurchased or called billion in debt securities and notional principal of interest rate swaps carrying a weighted average cost of percent and recognized a gain of million 
during the second quarter of  we adopted financial accounting standard no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no

this standard eliminates the extraordinary treatment of the gains and losses on our debt

for comparative purposes  we have reclassified all prior periods to conform to the current presentation 
income taxes the provision for federal income taxes  including tax related to the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  decreased to billion in from billion in the decrease in tax expense was primarily related to the tax benefit recorded on the increased purchased options expense 
our tax provision totaled billion in the combined effect of our low income housing tax credits and the reduction in our pre tax income from purchased options expense caused our effective tax rate on reported net income to decline to percent from percent in and percent in our effective tax rate based on our core business earnings  which is adjusted for the impact of fas on our purchased options  was percent in and percent in and see md a core business earnings and business segment results 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle effective january   we adopted fas  as amended by financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and certain hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
our adoption of fas on january   resulted in a cumulative after tax increase to income of million million pre tax in the cumulative effect on earnings from the change in accounting principle was primarily attributable to recording the fair value of the time value of purchased options  which are used as a substitute for callable debt securities 
core business earnings and business segment results management relies primarily on core business earnings  a supplemental non gaap measure developed in conjunction with our january  adoption of fas  to evaluate fannie mae s financial performance 
while core business earnings is not a substitute for gaap net income  we rely on core business earnings in operating our business because we believe core business earnings provides our management and investors with a better measure of our financial results and better reflects our risk management strategies than our gaap net income 
core business earnings excludes the unpredictable volatility in the time value of purchased options because we generally intend to hold these options to maturity  and we do not believe the period to period variability in our reported net income from changes in the time value of our purchased options accurately reflects the underlying risks or economics of our hedging strategy 
core business earnings includes amortization of purchased options premiums on a straight line basis over the original expected life of the options 
the net amount of purchased options amortization expense recorded under our core business earnings measure will equal the net amount of purchased options expense ultimately recorded under fas in our reported net income over the life of our options 
however  our amortization treatment is more consistent with the accounting for embedded options in our callable debt and more accurately reflects the underlying economics of our use of purchased options as a substitute for issuing callable debt two alternate hedging strategies that are economically very similar but require different accounting under fas management also relies on several other non gaap performance measures related to core business earnings to evaluate fannie mae s performance 
these key performance measures include taxable equivalent revenues  core net interest income  and net interest margin 
we discuss these measures further in this section and provide a discussion of our business segments  which we also evaluate based on core business earnings 
our core business earnings measures are not defined terms within gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
core business earnings we delivered record core business earnings in for the th consecutive year 
core business earnings increased percent over to billion due primarily to strong mortgage portfolio and net interest 
table of contents margin growth 
our core business earnings in grew percent over to billion  also due to strong portfolio and net interest margin growth 
financial highlights include percent increase in total taxable equivalent revenues percent growth in the average net mortgage portfolio percent increase in the total book of business basis point increase in the net interest margin decline in our credit loss ratio to 
basis points from 
basis points in while our core business earnings measures should not be construed by investors as an alternative to net income and other measures determined in accordance with gaap  they are critical performance indicators for fannie mae s management 
core business earnings is the primary financial performance measure used by fannie mae s management not only in developing the financial plans of our lines of business and tracking results  but also in establishing corporate performance targets and determining incentive compensation 
in addition  the investment analyst community has traditionally relied on our core business earnings measures to evaluate fannie mae s earnings performance and to issue earnings guidance 
we believe these measures also can serve as valuable assessment tools for investors to judge the quality of our earnings because they provide more consistent accounting and reporting for economically similar interest rate risk hedging transactions  which allows investors to more readily identify sustainable trends and gauge potential future earnings trends 
table shows our line of business and consolidated core business earnings results for   and we have reclassified certain amounts in our prior years results to conform to our current presentation 
the only difference in core business earnings and reported net income relates to the fas accounting treatment for purchased options  which affects our portfolio investment business 
the fas related reconciling items between our core business earnings and reported results have no effect on our credit guaranty business

table of contents while the reconciling items to derive our core business earnings are significant components in understanding and assessing our reported results and financial performance  investors may not be able to directly discern the underlying economic impact of our interest rate risk management strategies without our core business results 
we believe our core business earnings measures help to improve transparency and enhance investors understanding of our operations  as well as facilitate trend analysis 
the specific fas related adjustments affecting our portfolio investment business that we identify in table include a purchased options amortization expense this amount represents the straight line amortization of purchased options premiums over the original expected life of the options that we include in our core net interest income 
we include this amount in core business earnings instead of recording changes in the time value of purchased options because it is more consistent with the accounting for the embedded options in our callable debt and the vast majority of our mortgages 
b purchased options expense this amount  which is recorded in our income statement under purchased options expense  represents changes in the fair value of the time value of purchased options recorded in accordance with fas we exclude this amount from our core business earnings measure because the period to period fluctuations in the time value portion of our options does not reflect the economics of our current risk management strategy  which generally is to hold our purchased options to maturity or exercise date 
consequently  we do not expect to realize the period to period fluctuations in time value 
c cumulative after tax gain upon adoption of fas this non recurring amount represents the one time transition recorded upon the adoption of fas on january  we exclude the transition gain from core business earnings because it relates to unrealized gains on purchased options that were recorded when we adopted fas d provision for federal income taxes adjustment represents the net federal income tax effect of core business earnings adjustments based on the applicable federal income tax rate of percent 
core business earnings does not exclude any other accounting effects related to the application of fas or any other non fas related adjustments 
the guaranty fee income that we allocate to the credit guaranty business for managing the credit risk on mortgage related assets held by the portfolio investment business is offset by a corresponding guaranty fee expense allocation to the portfolio investment business in our line of business results 
thus  there is no inter segment elimination adjustment between our total line of business guaranty fee income and our reported guaranty fee income 
we allocate transaction fees received for structuring and facilitating securities transactions for our customers primarily to our portfolio investment business 
we allocate technology related fees received for providing desktop underwriter and other on line services and fees received for providing credit enhancement alternatives to our customers primarily to our credit guaranty business 
as discussed in md a risk management interest rate risk derivative instruments  we use various funding alternatives  including option based derivative instruments  that produce similar economic results to manage interest rate risk and protect against the prepayment option in mortgages 
the adjustments made to our portfolio investment business to derive core business earnings provide consistent accounting treatment for purchased options and the embedded option in callable debt securities economically equivalent funding transactions by allocating the cost of purchased options on a straight line basis over the original expected life of the option in a manner similar to our accounting for options in callable debt 
we calculate the original expected life of european options based on the exercise date 
we calculate the original expected life of american options based on the expected life at the time the option is purchased 
there is a difference in the original expected lives of european and american options because european options are exercisable only on one specific date in the future  while american options are exercisable any time after a specific future date 
the actual life of an american option may differ from our original expected life because of movements in interest rates subsequent to the exercise date that may affect the value and benefit of exercising the option at a given time 
we can protect our net interest margin against changes in interest rates by either issuing callable debt to fund the purchase of mortgages or using a combination of callable debt  purchased options  and noncallable 
table of contents debt 
we generally use the method that helps us achieve our desired funding flexibility and lowest cost 
if interest rates fall and our mortgages prepay  we have the option of retiring callable debt and issuing debt at a lower rate to preserve our interest spread on new mortgage purchases 
if interest rates fall and we have instead used a combination of noncallable debt and purchased options such as a swaption that would allow us to enter into a pay variable interest rate swap we can exercise our option to allow us to pay a variable or lower interest rate and receive a fixed rate of interest 
the fixed rate of interest that we receive would offset the cost of our noncallable  fixed rate debt 
this hedging strategy would lower our funding costs and preserve our net interest margin as interest rates fall in a manner very similar to retiring callable debt and issuing new  lower cost debt 
however  because the accounting for this hedging strategy is different under fas  the cost of the purchased option would not be reflected in our reported net interest yield 
we would be required to record the change in the fair value of the time value of the purchased option as a separate amount in our income statement 
on the other hand  if interest rates increase  we would not exercise the option to call debt since the cost of issuing new debt would be higher 
similarly  we would not exercise the option provided by a purchased swaption to enter a pay variable swap because under a higher interest rate environment  we could enter into a similar transaction with more favorable terms 
see md a risk management interest rate risk management derivative instruments for further discussion on how we use purchased options to simulate callable debt 
if we issue noncallable debt and purchased options to fund the purchase of mortgages and protect against the prepayment option in mortgages  we are required under fas to record the unrealized period to period fluctuations in the changes in time value of the purchased options in earnings 
if instead  we issue callable debt to fund the purchase of the same mortgages  the expense related to the option in our callable debt would be recognized ratably over the option period as part of interest expense 
although the two transactions produce similar economic results  gaap requires different accounting treatment 
under our core business earnings measure  the accounting treatment for purchased options is consistent and also comparable to the accounting treatment applied to these items in periods prior to the adoption of fas taxable equivalent revenues taxable equivalent revenues represent total revenues adjusted to reflect the benefits of investment tax credits and tax exempt income based on applicable federal income tax rates and is net of the straight line amortization of purchased options expense that would have been recorded prior to the adoption of fas for analytical purposes  we calculate revenues on a taxable equivalent basis to measure income from lower yielding investments that are tax exempt or generate tax credits on a basis comparable to higher yielding taxable investments 
table compares taxable equivalent revenues and the components for   and 
table of contents table taxable equivalent revenues year ended december  dollars in millions net interest income guaranty fee income fee and other income expense  net total revenues taxable equivalent adjustments investment tax credits tax exempt investments purchased options amortization expense taxable equivalent revenues includes net losses on certain tax advantaged investments totaling million  million  and million in   and  respectively

represents non gaap adjustment for straight line amortization of purchased options premiums that would have been recorded prior to the adoption of fas in this expense is included in net interest income in taxable equivalent revenues increased percent to billion in  compared with a percent increase in to billion 
the increase in both years was primarily attributable to growth in net interest income resulting from the low rate environment that contributed to strong mortgage portfolio growth and a reduction in our average cost of debt relative to our mortgage asset yields 
tighter mortgage to debt spreads reduced mortgage portfolio growth during the first half of and slowed the increase in taxable equivalent revenues to levels more in line with our expectations 
our growth rate was higher than expected because of the increased supply of mortgages in the secondary market and attractive mortgage to debt spreads 
core net interest income core net interest income and our related net interest margin are supplemental non gaap measures that management uses to evaluate fannie mae s performance 
core net interest income includes our reported net interest income adjusted for the non gaap amortization of purchased options premiums on a straight line basis over the original expected life of the options to reflect the cost associated with using purchased options to hedge the borrowers prepayment option in mortgages 
we also calculate core net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis to determine our net interest margin 
we believe these measures are beneficial in understanding and analyzing fannie mae s performance because they reflect consistent accounting for purchased options and callable debt  two of the principal instruments we use interchangeably to hedge the prepayment option in our mortgage investments 
these measures also consistently reflect income from taxable and tax exempt investments 
table reconciles taxable equivalent core net interest income to our reported net interest income and presents an analysis of our net interest margin based on the average balances and yields of mortgage assets  nonmortgage investments  and debt 
our taxable equivalent core net interest income and net interest margin are significantly different than our reported taxable equivalent net interest income and net interest yield because our core measures include the amortization of our purchased options premiums on a straight line basis over the life of the option  which is not in accordance with gaap

the portfolio investment business also capitalized on opportunities presented by the decline in interest rates that began in to reduce our debt costs and increase the net interest margin basis points to basis points 
in  the average net mortgage portfolio grew percent and the net interest margin increased basis points to basis points 
low mortgage rates boosted originations of fixed rate mortgages in the primary market to record levels in however  during the first half of  primary market lenders retained a higher than traditional level of mortgage loans in their own portfolios 
the demand for mortgage investments also increased among other secondary market participants 
we believe this occurrence was in response to equity market volatility and the perceived safety of mortgage related investments in a period of significant uncertainty about the impact of the economy on corporate creditworthiness 
in addition  the steep yield curve lowered borrowing costs for banks and other primary market participants  which made it more attractive to hold mortgage investments 
the increased competition for mortgages in the first half of resulted in tighter spreads between mortgage yields and our debt costs mortgage to debt spreads  which slowed our overall portfolio growth 
our portfolio growth accelerated in the second half of the year as a sharp drop in mortgage rates sparked a refinancing wave that increased the supply of mortgages in the secondary market and generated wider mortgage to debt spreads 
we substantially increased our mortgage commitments in response to these more attractive spreads 
we also experienced higher portfolio growth in because of attractive mortgage to debt spreads stemming from an increased supply of mortgage assets in the secondary market because of a reduction in intermediate term rates that boosted mortgage refinancings and originations 
the sharp decline in short term interest rates relative to long term interest rates during resulted in a steeper yield curve that persisted throughout our net interest margin in continued to benefit from actions taken during in response to opportunities presented by the unusually steep yield curve and low short term interest rates 
the portfolio investment business was able to replace significant amounts of called or maturing debt in with lower cost  shorter term debt more quickly than our mortgage assets matured or prepaid 
these actions temporarily reduced our debt cost relative to asset yield and elevated our net interest margin in our net interest margin remained elevated in as the unusually steep yield curve and low interest rate environment persisted  and we called or otherwise retired additional high cost debt

table of contents table option embedded debt instruments dollars in billions issued during the year outstanding at year end percentage of total net mortgage portfolio credit guaranty business core business earnings for our credit guaranty business grew percent in to billion and percent in to billion 
the increase in core business earnings was driven primarily by a percent increase in guaranty fee income 
guaranty fee income for our credit guaranty business increased largely due to percent growth in our average book of business and a 
basis point increase in the average fee rate to basis points 
the average fee rate for our credit guaranty business includes the effect of guaranty fee income allocated to the credit guaranty business for managing the credit risk on mortgage related assets held by the portfolio investment business 
it therefore differs from our consolidated effective average guaranty fee rate  which excludes guaranty fees on fannie mae mbs held in our portfolio because these fees are reported as interest income 
growth in earnings for the credit guaranty business lagged growth in guaranty fee income primarily due to increases in credit enhancement expenses  higher administrative expenses  and an increase in the effective tax rate 
administrative expenses increased primarily due to higher compensation costs and expenses related to re engineering our core infrastructure systems and relocating our primary data center 
record expansion of residential mortgage debt outstanding during and  combined with our ability to offer reliable  low cost mortgage funds  fueled growth in our book of business 
the demand for housing was strong throughout and  and borrowers also took advantage of the low interest rate environment to refinance their mortgages and extract equity from the appreciation in their homes 
residential mortgage debt outstanding increased percent in to trillion  percent in to trillion  and percent in to trillion 
refinancings represented percent of total market originations in and percent in  compared with percent in growth in fannie mae s mortgage credit book of business outpaced growth in residential mortgage debt outstanding during   and earnings growth in for the credit guaranty business was also driven by an increase in guaranty fees 
guaranty fees rose percent  stemming from percent growth in the average book of business that more than offset a basis point drop in the average fee rate to basis points 
despite significant growth in our mortgage credit book of business and a softer economy  the credit guaranty business was successful in reducing credit losses as a percentage of fannie mae s average book of business to 
basis points in  from 
basis points in and 
basis points in in the third quarter of  we announced increases in the upfront price adjustment fannie mae charges on cash out refinance mortgages with loan to value ltv ratios between and percent that we plan to implement during as a result of these increases  which will better compensate us for the higher risk on these loans  the upfront price adjustments on cash out refinance mortgages we purchase or guarantee with ltv ratios greater than percent will range from to basis points 
in conjunction with these increases and to better align our underwriting  pricing policy  and relative risk profile of refinance transactions  we modified our loan purpose definitions on refinance transactions 
we now define cash out refinance transactions as a refinance transaction in which the funds are used for purposes other than to pay off an existing first mortgage lien  to pay off any permissible subordinate mortgage liens  and to provide limited unrestricted cash proceeds to the borrower 
we expect the increased price adjustments  which will be allocated to our credit guaranty business  to modestly increase our future guaranty fees 

table of contents off balance sheet transactions we enter into certain off balance sheet financial arrangements to facilitate our statutory purpose of providing mortgage funds to the secondary market and reduce fannie mae s exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
these arrangements  which may involve elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of amounts recognized on fannie mae s balance sheet  primarily include guaranteed mbs and other mortgage related securities and commitments to purchase mortgage assets or issue and guarantee mbs 
following is an overview of our off balance sheet exposure related to these transactions  including a description of how our mbs are created and our role in the process 
guaranteed mbs and other mortgage related securities we issue mbs that are backed by mortgage loans from a single lender or from multiple lenders  or that are transferred from our held for sale mortgage portfolio 
single lender mbs are typically issued through lender swap transactions whereby a lender exchanges pools of mortgages for mbs 
multiple lender mbs allow several lenders to pool mortgages and receive  in return  mbs referred to as fannie majors representing a proportionate share of a larger pool 
lenders may retain the mbs or sell them to other investors 
when we issue mbs  we assume trustee responsibilities 
the loans underlying mbs are not our assets 
therefore  we do not record them on our balance sheet except when acquired and held in our mortgage portfolio for investment purposes  nor do we record them as liabilities 
in some instances we buy mortgage loans or mortgage related securities and concurrently enter into a forward sale commitment 
we designate these loans as held for sale when acquired  and we sell them from the mortgage portfolio as mbs 
the credit guaranty business receives a guaranty fee for assuming the credit risk and guaranteeing timely payment of scheduled principal and interest to mbs investors and investors in other mortgage related securities 
the guaranty fee varies  depending on factors such as the risk profile of the loans securitized as well as the level of credit risk we assume 
we are ultimately responsible for guaranteeing timely payment of scheduled principal and interest to investors whether or not we share primary default risk on loans underlying outstanding mbs 
we accrue a liability on our balance sheet for our guaranty obligation based on the probability that mortgages underlying the trillion of outstanding mbs will not perform according to contractual terms 
at december   we have accrued a liability of million for estimated losses on our guaranty of outstanding mbs  compared with million at december  these amounts are a component of the guaranty liability for mbs line on our balance sheet 
we issue remics backed by single class mbs  stripped mbs smbs  government national mortgage association ginnie mae mortgage related securities  other remic securities  or whole loans that are not owned or guaranteed by fannie mae 
the portfolio investment business receives transaction fees for structuring remics backed by mbs  smbs  ginnie mae securities  or existing fannie mae remic classes 
when we issue remics  we assume trustee responsibilities 
remics backed by guaranteed mbs do not subject us to any additional mortgage credit risk 
we are only subject to additional credit risk if fannie mae guarantees remics backed by whole loans owned by other entities or private label securities 
remics are not our assets except when acquired and held in our mortgage portfolio for investment purposes  nor do we record them as liabilities

total issued includes billion  billion  and billion of mbs purchased by fannie mae in   and  respectively 
total issued excludes billion  billion  and billion of mbs in   and  respectively  that fannie mae issued from loans in our portfolio 
guaranteed mbs and other mortgage related securities held by investors other than fannie mae  which we refer to as outstanding mbs  grew percent to trillion at december   from billion at december  remics that could subject fannie mae to additional credit exposure totaled billion at december  or percent of outstanding mbs held by investors other than fannie mae 
total mbs  which includes guaranteed mbs and other mortgage related securities held in our mortgage portfolio  grew percent to trillion at year end from trillion at year end mbs issues acquired by investors other than fannie mae increased billion to billion in  while liquidations of outstanding mbs increased billion to billion 
the increase in mbs issuances and liquidations in was attributable to the decline in mortgage interest rates during the year resulting in higher levels of mortgage originations  including refinancings 
total mbs issues  excluding mbs issued from fannie mae s portfolio  increased percent to billion in from billion in  while total mbs liquidations grew percent to billion from billion in remic issuances totaled billion in  compared with billion in our remic issuances rebounded in with the rest of the remic market and steadily increased in the steeper yield curve made the remic market more attractive  resulting in an increased demand for remics 
in addition  lower interest rates contributed to higher mbs issuances and increased collateral available for remics 
the outstanding balance of remics including remics held in fannie mae s portfolio was billion at december   compared with billion at december  commitments fannie mae enters into master delivery commitments on either a mandatory or an optional basis 
under a mandatory master commitment  a lender must either deliver loans under an mbs contract at a specified guaranty fee rate or enter into a mandatory portfolio commitment with the yield established upon executing the portfolio commitment 
we also accept mandatory or lender option delivery commitments not issued pursuant to a master commitment 
these commitments may be for our portfolio or for issuances of fannie mae mbs 
the guaranty fee rate on mbs lender option commitments is specified in the contract  while the yield for portfolio lender optional commitments is set at the date of conversion to a mandatory commitment 
we generally hedge the cost of funding future portfolio purchases upon issuance of  or conversion to  a mandatory commitment 
therefore  we largely mitigate the interest rate risk relating to loans purchased pursuant to those commitments 
our outstanding mandatory portfolio commitments  excluding commitments under master agreements  totaled billion and billion at december  and  respectively 

table of contents application of critical accounting policies fannie mae s financial statements and reported results are based on gaap  which requires us in some cases to use estimates and assumptions that may affect our reported results and disclosures 
we describe our significant accounting policies in the notes to financial statements under note  summary of significant accounting policies 
several of our accounting policies involve the use of accounting estimates we consider to be critical because they are likely to change from period to period because they require significant management judgment and assumptions about highly complex and uncertain matters  and the use of a different estimate or a change in estimate could have a material impact on our reported results of operations or financial condition 
our critical accounting estimates include determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and guaranty liability for mbs  projecting mortgage prepayments to calculate the amortization of deferred price adjustments on mortgages and mortgage related securities held in portfolio and guaranteed mortgage related securities  and estimating the time value of our purchased options 
management has specifically discussed the development and selection of each critical accounting estimate with the audit committee of fannie mae s board of directors 
our audit committee has also reviewed our disclosures in this md a regarding fannie mae s critical accounting estimates 
allowance for loan losses and guaranty liability for mbs we establish an allowance for loan losses and guaranty liability for mbs on single family and multifamily loans in our book of business 
we maintain a separate allowance for loan losses and guaranty liability for mbs 
however  we use the same methodology to determine the amounts of each because the risks are the same 
the allowance for loan losses is held against loans in our mortgage portfolio 
we also have a guaranty liability for our guaranty of mbs held by us or by other investors 
our allowance and guaranty liability for mbs consist of the following key elements single family we evaluate various risk characteristics such as product type  original loan to value ratio  and loan age to determine the allowance and guaranty liability for single family assets 
we estimate defaults for each risk characteristic based on historical experience and apply a historical severity to each risk category in accordance with financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for contingencies fas 
severity refers to the amount of loss suffered on a default relative to the unpaid principal balance of the loan 
in addition  we apply financial accounting standard no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan fas  to determine the amount of impairment on specific loans that have been restructured 
we charge off single family loans when we foreclose on the loans 
multifamily we determine the multifamily allowance and guaranty liability by separately evaluating loans that are impaired and all other loans 
impaired loans consist of loans that are not performing according to their original contractual terms 
for loans that we consider impaired  we apply fas to estimate the amount of impairment 
for all other loans  we apply fas to establish an allowance and guaranty liability by rating each loan not individually evaluated for impairment and segmenting the loan into one of the main risk categories we use to monitor the multifamily portfolio 
we then apply historical default rates  adjusted for current conditions  and a corresponding severity to the loans in each segment to estimate the probable loss amount at each balance sheet date 
we believe the accounting estimate related to our allowance for loan losses and guaranty liability for mbs is a critical accounting estimate because it requires us to make significant judgments about probable future losses in our book of business as of the balance sheet date based on assumptions that are uncertain 
we may have to increase or decrease the size of our overall allowance for loan losses and guaranty liability based on changes in delinquency levels  loss experience  economic conditions in areas of geographic concentration  and profile of mortgage characteristics 
different assumptions about default rates  severity  counterparty risk  and other factors that we could use in estimating our allowance for loan losses and guaranty liability could have a material effect on our results of operations 
we include the allowance for loan losses in the balance sheet under mortgage portfolio  net

represents ratio of allowance and guaranty liability balance by loan type to book of business by loan type 
over the past five years  our combined allowance for loan losses and guaranty liability for mbs have remained relatively stable although our book of business has expanded 
this trend reflects improvements in the credit performance of our book of business 
fannie mae s allowance and guaranty liability as a percentage of the book of business has declined to 
percent in  from

over the last three years  our credit loss ratio has declined in each year to 
basis points in  from 
basis points in  and 
basis points in we recorded a provision for losses of million  million  and million  respectively  in   and our provision represented between and percent of our pre tax reported income and core business earnings in each of the past three years 
management believes the combined balance of our allowance for loan losses and guaranty liability for mbs are adequate to absorb losses inherent in fannie mae s book of business 

table of contents deferred price adjustments when fannie mae buys mbs  loans  or mortgage related securities  we may not pay the seller the exact amount of the unpaid principal balance upb 
if we pay more than the upb and purchase the mortgage assets at a premium  the premium reduces the yield we recognize on the assets below the coupon amount 
if we pay less than the upb and purchase the mortgage assets at a discount  the discount increases the yield above the coupon amount 
in addition  we may charge an upfront payment in lieu of a higher guaranty fee for certain loan types that have higher credit risk 
to facilitate the pooling of mortgages into a fannie mae mbs  we also may adjust the monthly mbs guaranty fee rate that we receive by either negotiating an upfront cash disbursement to the lender a buy up or an upfront cash receipt from the lender a buy down when the mbs is formed 
the upfront payment results in an adjustment to the monthly guaranty fee so that the coupons on mbs are always in increments of whole or half interest rates  which are more easily traded 
we recognize the impact of premiums  discounts  and other purchase price adjustments over the estimated life of the purchased assets as an adjustment to income in accordance with financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans and initial direct costs of leases fas 
we amortize deferred premium and discount into interest income  which affects the results of our portfolio investment business 
amortization of deferred price adjustments relating to our guaranty fees affects guaranty fee income  which affects the results of our credit guaranty business 
we apply the interest method to amortize the premiums  discounts  and other purchase price adjustments into income 
we estimate future mortgage prepayments to calculate the constant effective yield necessary to apply the interest method 
we believe the accounting estimates related to deferred premium discount and deferred guaranty fees are critical accounting estimates because they require us to make significant judgments and assumptions about borrower prepayment patterns in various interest rate environments that involve a significant degree of uncertainty 
on a periodic basis  we evaluate whether we should change the estimated prepayment rates used in the amortization calculation 
we reassess our estimate of the sensitivity of prepayments to changes in interest rates and compare actual prepayments versus anticipated prepayments 
if changes are necessary  we recalculate the constant effective yield and adjust net interest income or guaranty fee income for the amount of premiums  discounts  and other purchase price adjustments that would have been recorded if we had applied the new effective yield since acquisition of the mortgage assets or inception of a guaranty

reflects after tax effect on reported net income from the change in net amortization based on the applicable federal income tax rate of percent 
calculated based on an instantaneous change in interest rates 
deferred premium discount as shown in table  fannie mae moved to a net premium position of million in our mortgage portfolio at the end of from a net discount position of billion at year end and billion at year end because of declining interest rates throughout  we paid premiums on a higher than average proportion of our mortgage purchases during the year 
net interest income recognized from the amortization of deferred price adjustments related to our mortgage portfolio increased our reported net income by percent in  percent in  and percent in table discloses the estimated adjustments that we would have to make to our net interest income based on and basis point instantaneous changes in interest rates at year end beyond the levels assumed in our base prepayment rate models 
our prepayment sensitivity analysis indicates that a basis point instantaneous increase in interest rates beyond the levels assumed in base prepayment rate models would have resulted in less than a 
percent decrease in net interest income in   and we estimate that a basis point decrease in interest rates at december    and would have increased our net interest income in each of those years by approximately percent 
the effect of declines in interest rates has a larger impact on net interest income than interest rate increases because declines in interest rates result in prepayments that lower the weighted average coupon of our mortgage assets more significantly than instantaneous increases in interest rates raise the weighted average coupon of our mortgage assets 
as a result  the adjustment of net interest income from a downward shift in interest rates would be larger than the adjustment of net interest income from a rising shift in interest rates 
despite being in a net premium position at year end  an instantaneous decrease in interest rates would 
table of contents have a positive impact on net interest income largely because those mortgage assets in a net premium position have a lower average coupon than those mortgage assets in a net discount position 
consequently  the estimated downward adjustment of net interest income for the amortization of the premium after an instantaneous decline in interest rates would be lower than the estimated upward adjustment of net interest income for the amortization of the discount 
this sensitivity analysis is only one component of fannie mae s overall net interest income at risk assessment 
it does not include the effect of new business or the impact of changes in interest rates on our debt costs or net cash flows related to our derivatives contracts 
a comprehensive analysis of the impact of interest rate changes on projected net interest income is presented in md a risk management interest rate risk management net interest income at risk 
deferred guaranty fees our net discount position on deferred guaranty fee price adjustments increased to billion at year end from a net discount position of million at year end and a net premium position of million at year end a net discount position reflects that the combined up front payments we collect in lieu of higher guaranty fees on more risky loans and the up front payments we receive from lenders in exchange for a lower guaranty fee rate over time exceed the up front payments we make to lenders in exchange for a higher guaranty fee rate over time 
a net premium position indicates that our upfront payments to lenders exceed the upfront fees collected from lenders 
the significant increase in our net discount position on deferred guaranty fees in was largely attributable to an increase in up front payments collected on loans with higher credit risk 
amortization of deferred guaranty fee adjustments increased guaranty fee income by million in percent of reported net income and reduced guaranty fee income by million in percent of reported net income and million in less than percent of reported net income 
the upward adjustment to guaranty fee income in was primarily related to accelerating the recognition of discount during the second half of as interest rates fell to historically low levels and prepayments accelerated 
in addition  we made enhancements in to better reflect the impact of interest rates on prepayment behavior and guaranty fee income that accelerated the recognition of discount 
our prepayment sensitivity analysis at the end of each year for deferred guaranty fees indicates that a basis point instantaneous increase in interest rates beyond the levels assumed in base prepayment rate models at year end would have less than a percent upward effect on guaranty fee income in   and a basis point instantaneous decrease in interest rates at year end would have increased our guaranty fee income by approximately percent in and reduced our guaranty fee income by approximately percent and percent in and  respectively 
the growth and age of the net discount position in is the primary driver of the positive impact on guaranty fee income from an instantaneous basis point decrease in interest rates 
time value of purchased options fannie mae issues various types of debt to finance the acquisition of mortgages 
we typically use derivative instruments to supplement our issuance of debt in the capital markets and hedge against the effect of fluctuations in interest rates on our debt costs to preserve our net interest margin 
with the adoption of fas  we began recording all derivatives on our balance sheet at estimated fair value 
we record changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci 
we recognize in our reported earnings changes in the fair value of the time value associated with purchased options and changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges 
fannie mae s purchased options portfolio currently includes swaptions and caps  which are discussed in more detail under md a risk management interest rate risk management derivative instruments 
the total fair value for purchased options consists of the time value plus the intrinsic value 
under fas  the mark to market on the time value component of our purchased options flows through our reported earnings 
the time value of purchased options will vary from period to period with changes in interest 
table of contents rates  expected interest rate volatility  and derivative activity 
however  the total expense included in earnings over the original expected life of an option will generally equal the initial option premium paid 
since adopting fas  we have reported significant fluctuations in our reported net income because of unrealized fluctuations in the estimated time value of purchased options 
as a result of the declining interest rate environment in and the increase in the notional value of our purchased options  we recorded billion in purchased options expense in  compared with million in our methodology for valuing purchased options is based on commonly used market conventions and assumptions 
we obtain quoted market prices for a benchmark set of interest rate options  which include caps and swaptions 
based on these quoted market prices  we apply our valuation model  which effectively utilizes these prices to estimate the fair value of our purchased options 
we then allocate the fair value of our purchased options into the time value and intrinsic value components 
because the benchmark securities are only a subset of the purchased options that we hold  the estimation of time value is not exact and can vary depending on the market source and methodology used 
this variation could have a material effect on our reported net income 
hence  we believe our estimate of the time value component of purchased options is a critical accounting estimate 
during the fourth quarter of  we refined our methodology for estimating the initial time value of interest rate caps at the date of purchase 
under our previous valuation method  we treated the entire premium paid on purchased at the money caps as time value with no allocation to intrinsic value 
we now allocate the purchase price to reflect the value of individual caplets  some of which are above the strike rate of the cap 
this approach  which is more consistent with our estimation of time value subsequent to the initial purchase date  results in a higher intrinsic value and lower time value at the date of purchase 
we adopted this preferred valuation method prospectively on caps purchased after third quarter  which resulted in a million pre tax reduction in our purchased options expense 
the change has no effect on the total expense that will be recorded in our income statement over the life of our caps and no effect on our core business earnings 
to gauge the potential sensitivity of changes in the estimated time value of our purchased options  we recalculated our estimates based on plus and minus changes of percent and percent in the time value portion of our outstanding purchased options at december  and an increase in the estimated time value of our purchased options would reduce our purchased options expense and increase our reported net income and stockholders equity  while a decrease in the estimated time value would increase purchased options expense and reduce our reported net income and stockholders equity 
these changes are generally greater than changes we have observed historically in our valuation process 
table shows the potential effect on our and reported results from these changes in time value 
there would be no effect on our results as we adopted fas on january  table impact of changes in the time value of purchased options percentage of change in fair reported net percentage of total value adjustment income stockholders equity dollars in millions change in time value na na na change in time value na na na reflects after tax effect of time value adjustment based on applicable federal income tax rate of percent

a plus or minus change of percent in the time value portion of our purchased options at december  and would change our reported net income by approximately percent and percent  respectively 
changing the time value portion of our purchased options by percent or percent would change our total stockholders equity by approximately percent or percent  respectively  at december  and our core business earnings results would not be affected by these estimates

risk management fannie mae is subject to three major areas of risk interest rate risk  credit risk  and operations risk 
active management of these risks is an essential part of our operations and a key determinant of our ability to maintain steady earnings growth 
the following discussion highlights the strategies we use to manage these three risks 
interest rate risk management interest rate risk is the risk of loss to future earnings or long term value that may result from changes in interest rates 
our interest rate risk is concentrated primarily in our mortgage portfolio where nearly percent of our mortgages are intermediate term or long term  fixed rate loans that borrowers have the option to prepay at any time without penalty 
we are exposed to interest rate risk because the cash flows of our mortgage assets and the liabilities that fund them are not perfectly matched through time and across all possible interest rate scenarios 
the cash flows from our mortgage assets are highly sensitive to changes in interest rates because of the borrower s prepayment option 
as interest rates decrease  borrowers are more likely to refinance fixed rate mortgages  resulting in increased prepayments and mortgage cash flows that are received earlier than expected 
replacing the higher rate loans that prepay with lower rate loans has the potential of reducing our interest spread unless we are able to also reduce our debt cost 
conversely  an increase in interest rates may result in slower than expected prepayments and mortgage cash flows that are received later than expected 
in this case  we have the risk that our debt may reprice faster than our mortgage assets and at a higher cost  which could also reduce our interest spread 
the objective of our interest rate risk management process is to maintain long term value through a low variability of future earnings due to changes in interest rates  while preserving stable earnings growth and a competitive return on equity over time 
the board of directors oversees interest rate risk management through the adoption of corporate goals and objectives and the review of regular reports on performance against them 
senior management is responsible for ensuring that appropriate long term strategies are in place to achieve the goals and objectives 
management establishes reference points for the key performance measures that we use to signal material changes in risk and to assist in determining whether we should adjust portfolio strategy to achieve long term objectives 
management regularly reports these measures and reference points to the board of directors 
the portfolio investment committee  which includes our senior mortgage portfolio managers  meets weekly and reviews current financial market conditions  portfolio risk measures  and performance targets 
the committee develops and monitors near term strategies and the portfolio s standing relative to its long term objectives 
the results of portfolio investment committee meetings are reported to the weekly asset and liability management committee  which is comprised of senior management and includes our chief executive officer 
fannie mae s overall objective in managing interest rate risk is to deliver consistent net interest income growth and target returns on capital over a wide range of interest rate environments 
central elements of our approach to managing interest rate risk include funding assets by issuing liabilities that have similar cash flow patterns through time and in different interest rate environments  regularly assessing the portfolio s exposure to changes in interest rates using a diverse set of analyses and measures  and setting parameters for rebalancing actions to help attain corporate objectives 
funding mortgage assets with liabilities that have similar cash flow patterns through time and in different interest rate environments 
when we purchase mortgages we attempt to match the initial estimated life  or duration  of our liabilities to our assets within a range to achieve a stable and competitive net interest margin 
we issue a mix of debt securities across a broad spectrum of final maturities to achieve the desired liability durations 
because the estimated lives of mortgage assets change as interest rates change  we frequently issue 
table of contents callable debt or use derivatives to alter the estimated life of our liabilities to partially match the expected change in duration of our mortgage assets 
the duration of callable debt  like that of a mortgage  shortens when interest rates decrease and lengthens when interest rates increase 
if interest rates decrease  we are likely to call debt that carries an interest rate higher than the current market 
we use interest rate swaps and other derivatives with embedded interest rate options to achieve our desired liability structure and to better match both the duration and prepayment risk of our mortgage assets 
these derivatives  coupled with appropriate debt securities  are close substitutes for callable and noncallable debt 
through the use of these derivatives  we can synthetically create debt with cash flows similar to our mortgage assets 
regularly assessing the portfolio s exposure to changes in interest rates using a diverse set of analyses and measures 
interest rate risk measurement we utilize a wide range of risk measures and analyses to manage the interest rate risk inherent in the mortgage portfolio 
we categorize these risk measures and analyses into three types ongoing business risk measures and analyses  run off measures of the existing portfolio  and stress test scenarios 
the combination of ongoing business and run off risk measures and analyses present a comprehensive picture of fannie mae s current risk position that we use for day to day risk management decisions 
stress test scenarios provide information on our risk to more extreme but lower probability events 
our ongoing business risk measures and analyses include net interest income at risk and repricing gap analyses 
we base net interest income at risk measures on the mortgage portfolio as of a certain date plus projections of future business activity 
future business activity includes projected mortgage purchases and funding actions 
management believes that ongoing business risk measures and analyses provide a better perspective on the interest rate risk we face as a continuing business and a more comprehensive depiction of our risk profile than run off measures 
however  they contain more assumption risk due to the inherent uncertainty in projecting future business activity 
run off measures of interest rate risk include duration  convexity  and repricing gaps 
we base run off measures on the mortgage portfolio as of a certain date without incorporating future business activity 
run off measures provide an assessment of the interest rate risk of the existing portfolio without the assumption risk inherent in projecting future business activity 
however  we believe it is important to manage interest rate risk in the context of ongoing business activity because future business is highly probable and has a pronounced effect on our interest rate risk profile 
stress test scenarios include extreme movements in risk factors on both ongoing business and run off measures of risk 
we periodically measure and analyze the effects that extreme movements in the level of interest rates and the slope of the yield curve would have on the company s risk position 
in addition  we evaluate stress scenarios that include severe changes in expected prepayment speeds and the level of interest rate volatility 
while stress testing is an integral part of our risk management process  the ongoing business and run off measures of risk are the primary inputs in daily risk management decisions 
many of our projections of mortgage cash flows in our interest rate risk measures depend on our proprietary prepayment models 
while we are highly confident in the quality of these models  we recognize the historical patterns that serve as input for our models may not continue in the future 
the models contain many assumptions  including those regarding borrower behavior in certain interest rate environments and borrower relocation rates 
other assumptions such as projections of interest rates  shape of the yield curve  and interest rate volatility are also critical components to our interest rate risk measures 
we maintain a research program to constantly evaluate  update  and enhance these assumptions  models  and analytical tools as appropriate to reflect management s best assessment of the environment 

table of contents net interest income at risk net interest income at risk is our primary ongoing business measure of interest rate risk 
net interest income at risk measures the projected impact of changes in the level of interest rates and the shape of the yield curve on the mortgage portfolio s expected or base core net interest income over the immediate future one and four year periods 
to determine our base core net interest income  we estimate core net interest income over a wide range of interest rate environments using stochastic interest rate simulations 
stochastic interest rate simulations are a widely used statistical method to estimate the path and pattern of interest rates 
our stochastic simulations produce probability distributions of future interest rates based on expected interest rate volatility and are based on proprietary interest rate models 
we generate several hundred interest rate paths distributed around the current fannie mae yield curve from these simulations 
the fannie mae yield curve represents market assumptions regarding our expected cost of funds over a variety of maturities and takes into account the risk premium on our debt relative to benchmark interest rates 
we project core net interest income for four years along each path based on the characteristics of the current mortgage portfolio and projected future business activity 
the expected or base core net interest income is calculated based on the average core net interest income across all simulation paths and serves as the basis for determining our interest rate risk profile 
our projections of future business activity used in these simulations are reported to senior management and our board of directors and provide the basis for fannie mae s current earnings forecasts 
we determine the amount of net interest income at risk by assuming a sudden change or shock to the current yield curve and repeating the simulation 
we regularly evaluate a wide range of instantaneous shocks to both the level and shape of the yield curve and create the net interest income at risk profile by comparing the percentage change in core net interest income between each shocked simulation and the base simulation 
our net interest income at risk disclosures  which we report to the public on a monthly basis  represent the extent to which our core net interest income over the next one year and four year periods is at risk due to a plus or minus basis point parallel change in the current fannie mae yield curve and from a basis point change in the slope of fannie mae s yield curve 
we selected these shocks for our monthly disclosure because they capture approximately percent of historical changes in interest rates over a one month reporting period 
duration gap the portfolio duration gap is a run off measure of interest rate risk 
the duration gap is the difference between the estimated durations of portfolio assets and liabilities 
duration gap summarizes the extent to which estimated cash flows for assets and liabilities are matched  on average  over time and across interest rate scenarios 
a positive duration gap signals a greater exposure to rising interest rates because it indicates that the duration of our assets exceeds the duration of our liabilities 
a negative duration gap signals a greater exposure to declining interest rates because the duration of our assets is less than the duration of our liabilities 
we apply the same interest rate process  prepayment models  and volatility assumptions used in our net interest income at risk measure to generate the portfolio duration gap 
the duration gap reflects the current mortgage portfolio  including priced asset and debt commitments 
we do not incorporate projected future business activity or nonmortgage investments into our duration gap measure 
we regularly evaluate the sensitivity of the duration gap over a wide range of instantaneous changes to both the level and shape of the yield curve 
the duration gap provides a relatively concise and simple measure of the interest rate risk inherent in the existing mortgage portfolio  but it is not directly linked to expected future earnings performance 
future business activity  which is not reflected in the duration gap  can have a significant effect even over a very short horizon 
we disclose on a monthly basis our duration gap at the end of each month along with our net interest income at risk  which together we believe provide a more informative profile of our overall interest rate risk position than either measure alone 

table of contents setting the parameters for rebalancing actions to help attain corporate objectives 
management develops rebalancing actions based on a number of factors that include the relative standing of both net interest income at risk and duration gap  as well as analyses based on additional risk measures and current market activities and conditions 
we establish internal reference points  or indicators  for our risk measures to signal when we should re examine the risk profile of our assets 
our reference points are set by fannie mae s management  not by any external or regulatory requirement  to provide a tool for determining when and to what extent we should consider rebalancing actions 
these reference points do not represent absolute risk limits 
they are generally consistent with levels of interest rate risk that we project will not result in significant variability in future earnings and long term value 
as these risk measures begin to move beyond our internally established reference points  we consider actions to bring them within our preferred ranges in a manner that is consistent with achieving fannie mae s earnings objectives 
as a risk measure moves further outside our preferred range  we place significantly greater emphasis on reducing our risk exposure and less emphasis on earnings objectives 
we have not established a specific time horizon over which rebalancing actions must take place 
risk management results was a year of significant interest rate movements coupled with unprecedented levels of interest rate volatility 
fannie mae s disciplined risk management process was critical to successfully meeting the company s interest rate risk objectives throughout this challenging environment 
during the first half of  our interest rate risk measures were within our reference points  and no significant rebalancing actions were considered necessary 
between june and september  interest rates declined significantly and our primary risk measures began to move outside of our preferred range 
as these risk measures approached our internally established reference points  we developed strategies to moderately rebalance the portfolio 
as rates continued to fall  we increased the pace of rebalancing significantly 
after our interest rate risk measures reached peak levels in august  we continued to aggressively rebalance to bring our risk measures within our established reference points 
we utilized a wide range of tools to execute this rebalancing  including increased mortgage purchases  reduced fixed rate debt issuances  debt repurchases  and derivative transactions

compared to and  the net interest income at risk was at somewhat higher levels and more variable during the results for reflect the extreme low level of interest rates as well as unprecedented levels of interest rate volatility related to uncertainty about the economic outlook 

table of contents logo logo 
table of contents table presents our net interest income at risk based on an instantaneous basis point increase and a basis point decrease in interest rates 
the risk measure is an extension of our voluntary monthly net interest income at risk disclosure  and we use the same data  assumptions  and methodology 
we consider our net interest income at risk at december  to be low as our exposure to a basis point instantaneous increase in interest rates was estimated not to exceed percent and percent over a year and year horizon  respectively  and our exposure to a basis point instantaneous decrease in rates was estimated not to exceed more than percent over a year and year horizon 
in comparison  we had what we consider to be a moderate level of risk exposure at december  to increasing rates and a benefit from decreasing rates 
the changes in the profile of net interest income at risk from december  to december  were driven by changes in the level of interest rates and shape of the yield curve  changes in the composition of the portfolio  and changes in forecast assumptions 
actual portfolio net interest income may differ from these estimates because of specific interest rate movements  changing business conditions  changing prepayments  and management actions 
table net interest income at risk december  december  year portfolio year portfolio year portfolio year portfolio net interest net interest net interest net interest income at risk income at risk income at risk income at risk assuming a basis point increase in interest rates assuming a basis point decrease in interest rates duration gap fannie mae s duration gap was minus months at december   versus plus months at december  the negative shift in our duration gap during was primarily the result of historically low interest rates that resulted in a surge in expected refinancings 
the significant increase in our expectation of mortgage prepayments caused the durations of our mortgages to shorten by more than the durations of our debt during our monthly duration gap turned sharply negative during the year  falling to minus months at the end of august before narrowing to minus months by the end of the year 
the movement in the duration gap during was not unusual given our historical experience during previous refinance waves or periods of significant interest rate volatility 
our duration gap also moved significantly during each of the prior major refinancing waves in   and over the past decade  fannie mae s duration gap has been wider than plus or minus months approximately one third of the time 
during  our monthly duration gap was wider than plus or minus months three times 
although periods of heavy refinancing are typically associated with somewhat higher risk levels  these periods historically have provided positive opportunities for our portfolio 
through our normal business activities of buying mortgages and issuing debt  we historically have been able to bring our duration gap measure within our target range in a manner and pace that does not put undue demands on the market 
opportunities to add new business during the latter half of developed at about the pace we anticipated in a low rate environment 
the increased business activity fueled our purchase of long term  fixed rate mortgages  which helped to lengthen the duration of our mortgage assets and offset our negative duration gap 
in addition  we took a number of specific rebalancing actions in the latter half of to reduce our negative duration gap  including funding our longer duration mortgage purchases with shorter term debt  repurchasing long term outstanding debt  terminating certain long term pay fixed interest rate swaps  and entering into option based derivatives transactions 
if interest rates increase  some of our rebalancing actions could result in lower portfolio returns than would have occurred without the rebalancing 
however  our objective is to maintain an interest rate risk profile that is balanced to protect us against both increases and decreases in interest rates 
because managing our duration gap through rebalancing actions is a routine part of our interest rate risk management strategy  we do not expect these actions to have a material adverse effect on our future earnings objectives 

table of contents the graph below shows fannie mae s monthly duration gap compared with the yield on fannie mae year debt for the last three years 
logo convexity convexity measures are commonly used as a supplement to duration measures to reflect the degree to which durations are likely to change in response to movements in interest rates 
convexity provides us with information on how quickly and by how much the portfolio s duration gap may change in different interest rate environments 
our primary strategy for managing convexity risk is to either issue callable debt or purchase interest rate derivatives with embedded options 
we may also change the mix of assets we purchase to manage convexity risk 
for example  arms  shorter term fixed rate mortgages  and some seasoned loans have less prepayment risk relative to new year fixed rate mortgages  and as a result  reduce convexity risk 
generally  our preferred option is to issue callable debt or purchase optionality rather than change the mix of our assets because we find greater value in investing in longer term  fixed rate loans 
during  we continued to take advantage of the opportunity to reduce our debt costs by redeeming significant amounts of callable debt in response to the sharp decline in short term interest rates that began in at the same time  we continued to reduce the portfolio s convexity by aggressively increasing the amount of option protection through the issuance of callable debt or the purchase of interest rate derivatives with embedded options 
these instruments give us the option to reduce the duration of our liabilities to offset potential increases in mortgage prepayments that usually occur when mortgage rates fall 
by the end of  we had increased our option embedded debt  which includes callable debt and option based derivatives  as a percentage of our net mortgage portfolio to percent from percent at the end of as part of our rebalancing strategy during the last half of  we increased our use of short term european options  which temporarily increased the percentage of our mortgage portfolio with option embedded rate protection beyond the average range of the past years 
at december   the remaining outstanding notional amount of these options totaled approximately percent of our net mortgage portfolio 
callable debt and option based derivative instruments debt represented percent and percent  respec 
table of contents tively of the billion in option embedded debt outstanding at december  in comparison  callable debt and option based derivative instruments  represented percent and percent  respectively of the billion in option embedded debt outstanding at december  interest rate sensitivity of net asset value another indicator of the interest rate exposure of fannie mae s existing business is the sensitivity of the fair value of net assets net asset value to changes in interest rates 
table presents our estimated net asset value as of december  and  and the impact on our estimated net asset value of a hypothetical plus and minus basis point instantaneous shock in interest rates 
our analysis is based on these interest rates changes because we believe they reflect reasonably possible near term outcomes 
table interest rate sensitivity of net asset value net asset percentage of net asset percentage of value net asset value value net asset value dollars in millions december assuming a basis point increase in interest rates assuming a basis point decrease in interest rates changes in net asset value incorporate various factors  including estimated changes in the values of all mortgage assets and the debt funding these assets  estimated changes in the value of net guaranty fee income from off balance sheet mbs obligations  estimated changes in the value of interest rate derivatives 
as indicated in table  the projected fair value of our net assets at december  for a basis point instantaneous increase would increase by approximately percent  while a basis point instantaneous decline in interest rates would reduce the fair value by approximately percent 
the sensitivities at december  reflect that we have greater risk exposure to a decline in interest rates  similar to the results generated by our duration gap  but slightly different than the results of our net interest income at risk measure due to the effects of the future business activity included in that measure 
the difference in the risk profile from december  and december  is largely due to lower interest rates and a change in the mix of the portfolio 
the net asset value at december   as presented in table  is the same as that disclosed in the notes to financial statements under note  disclosures of fair value of financial instruments 
we derived the net asset values for the hypothetical interest rate scenarios in a manner consistent with the estimation procedures described in note the net asset value sensitivities do not necessarily represent the changes that would actually occur because the sensitivities are based on liquidating business and do not include the going concern effects of adding new business 
derivative instruments purpose and benefit of derivatives derivative instruments are important tools that we use to manage interest rate risk and supplement our issuance of debt in the capital markets 
we are an end user of derivatives and do not take speculative positions with derivatives or any other financial instrument 
we use a combination of option embedded and non option embedded derivatives to better match the cash flow variability inherent in mortgages 
we also use derivative instruments to hedge against changes in interest rates prior to debt issuance 
interest rate derivatives allow us to essentially lock in our funding cost at the time we commit to purchase mortgages rather than at the time of our next benchmark debt issuance 
in addition  we use currency derivatives to convert debt issued in foreign currencies to us dollars to minimize or negate any currency risk 

table of contents fannie mae primarily uses derivatives as a substitute for notes and bonds we issue in the debt markets 
when we purchase mortgage assets  we fund the purchases with a combination of equity and debt 
the debt we issue is a mix that typically consists of short and long term  noncallable debt and callable debt 
the varied maturities and flexibility of these debt combinations help us in reducing the cash flow mismatch between the performance of our assets and liabilities 
we can use a mix of debt issuances and derivatives to achieve the same duration matching that would be achieved by issuing only debt securities 
the following is an example of funding alternatives that we could use to achieve similar economic results rather than issuing a year noncallable fixed rate note  we could issue short term debt and enter into a year interest rate swap with a highly rated counterparty 
the derivative counterparty would pay a floating rate of interest to us on the swap that we would use to pay the interest expense on the short term debt  which we would continue to reissue periodically 
we would pay the counterparty a fixed rate of interest on the swap  thus achieving the economics of a year fixed rate note issue 
similarly  instead of issuing a year fixed rate note callable after three years  we could issue a year note and enter into a pay fixed swaption that would have the same economics as a year callable note 
if we want to extend the debt beyond three years  the swaption would give us the option to enter into a swap agreement where we would pay a fixed rate of interest to the derivative counterparty over the remaining year period 
the ability to either issue debt securities or modify debt through the use of derivatives increases our funding flexibility and potentially reduces our overall funding costs 
we may be able to obtain a specific funding structure using derivatives that we cannot obtain through the issuance of callable debt 
in addition  it can be less expensive to use the mix of debt securities and derivatives to achieve a given funding objective 
we generally use the method that provides the lowest funding costs and desired flexibility 
table gives an example of equivalent funding alternatives for a mortgage purchase with funding derived solely from debt securities versus funding with a blend of debt securities and derivatives 
as illustrated by table  we can achieve similar economic results by funding our mortgage purchases with either debt securities or a combination of debt securities and derivatives 
table equivalent debt and derivative funding fund with debt securities debt securities and derivatives percentage type of debt percentage type of debt short term debt short term debt year noncallable debt year noncallable debt year noncallable debt short term debt plus year swap year callable in years year noncallable debt plus pay fixed swaption this example indicates the possible funding mix and does not represent how an actual purchase would necessarily be funded 
fannie mae also uses derivatives to hedge against fluctuations in interest rates on planned debt issuances 
the hedging of anticipated debt issuances enables us to maintain an orderly and cost effective debt issuance schedule so we can fund daily loan purchase commitments without significantly increasing our interest rate risk or changing the spread of our funding costs versus other market interest rates 
most of the mortgages that fannie mae commits to purchase are for a future settlement date  typically two weeks to three months into the future 
fannie mae would be exposed to additional interest rate risk from changes in market rates prior to settlement if we did not issue debt at the time of the commitment or did not lock in an interest rate by hedging the anticipated debt issuance 
by hedging anticipated debt issuance versus issuing debt at the time of 
table of contents commitment  we are able to issue debt in larger size and on a regular schedule so that liquidity is enhanced while our relative cost of funds is reduced 
fannie mae uses derivatives to hedge foreign currency exposure 
we occasionally issue debt in a foreign currency 
because all of our assets are denominated in us dollars  we enter into currency swaps to effectively convert the foreign denominated debt into us dollar denominated debt 
by swapping out of foreign currencies completely at the time of the debt issue  we minimize our exposure to any currency risk 
our foreign denominated debt represents less than one percent of total debt outstanding 
primary types of derivatives used table summarizes the primary derivative instruments fannie mae uses along with the key hedging strategies we employ to manage our various interest rate risk exposures 
table primary types of derivatives used derivative hedging instrument hedged item purpose of the hedge transaction pay fixed  receive variable interest rate swap variable rate debt anticipated issuance of debt to protect against an increase in interest rates by converting the debt s variable rate to a fixed rate

basis swap or spread lock variable rate assets and liabilities to lock in or preserve the spread between variable rate  interest earning assets and variable rate  interest bearing liabilities 
pay fixed swaption variable rate debt to protect against an increase in interest rates by having an option to convert floating rate debt to a fixed rate 
caps variable rate debt to protect against an increase in interest rates by providing a limit on the interest costs on our debt in a rising rate environment 
receive fixed swaption noncallable fixed rate debt to protect against a decline in interest rates by having an option to convert fixed rate debt to floating rate debt 
foreign currency swaps foreign currency denominated debt to protect against fluctuations in exchange rates on non us dollar denominated debt by converting the interest expense and principal payment on foreign denominated debt to us dollar denominated debt 
as table indicates  we use what the marketplace generally regards as relatively straightforward types of interest rate derivative instruments  primarily interest rate swaps  basis swaps  swaptions  and caps 
swaps provide for the exchange of fixed and variable interest payments based on contractual notional principal amounts 
these may include callable swaps a combination of a swap and swaptions  which gives counterparties or fannie mae the right to terminate interest rate swaps before their stated maturities 
they may also include foreign currency swaps in which fannie mae and counterparties exchange payments in different types of currencies 
basis swaps provide for the exchange of variable payments that have maturities similar to hedged debt  but have payments based on different interest rate indices 
swaptions give fannie mae the right to enter into a swap at a future date 
interest rate caps provide ceilings on the interest rates of 
table of contents variable rate debt 
purchased options are another important risk management tool we use to reduce the cash flow mismatches driven by the prepayment option in mortgages 
american homeowners have options to pay off their mortgages at any time 
we use options of our own to manage this prepayment option risk on the loans we hold in portfolio 
we obtain these options by either issuing callable debt or purchasing stand alone options and linking them to the debt they are hedging

the exposure to counterparty default after offsetting arrangements  such as master netting 
table of contents agreements and the value of related collateral  is the appropriate measure of the actual credit risk of derivative contracts 
we believe the risk of loss on fannie mae s derivatives book is low for three primary reasons our stringent counterparty eligibility standards  our conservative collateral policy  which has provisions requiring collateral on our derivative contracts in gain positions  and our intensive exposure monitoring and management 
fannie mae has never experienced a loss on a derivative transaction due to credit default by a counterparty 
the credit risk on our derivative transactions is low because our counterparties are of very high credit quality 
our counterparties consist of large banks  broker dealers  and other financial institutions that have a significant presence in the derivatives market  most of whom are based in the united states 
we manage derivative counterparty credit risk by contracting only with experienced counterparties that have high credit ratings 
we initiate derivative contracts only with counterparties rated a or better 
as an additional precaution  we have a conservative collateral management policy with provisions for requiring collateral on our derivative contracts in gain positions 
we also monitor credit exposure on our derivatives daily by valuing them using internal pricing models and dealer quotes 
we make collateral calls daily based on the results of our internal models and dealer quotes 
we enter into master agreements that provide for netting of amounts due to us and amounts due to counterparties under those agreements 
new york law governs all of our master derivatives agreements 
the estimated total notional balance of the global derivatives market was trillion at june  based on combined data from the bank for international settlements for over the counter derivatives and published figures for exchange traded derivatives 
fannie mae s outstanding notional principal balance of billion at december  represented less than 
percent of the total estimated derivatives market 
although notional principal is a commonly used measure of volume in the derivatives market  it is not a meaningful measure of market or credit risk since the notional amount does not change hands other than in the case of foreign currency swaps 
counterparties use the notional amounts of derivative instruments to calculate contractual cash flows to be exchanged 
however  the notional amount is significantly greater than the potential market or credit loss that could result from such transactions 
the fair value of derivatives in a gain position is a more meaningful measure of our current market exposure on derivatives

fannie mae s exposure on derivative contracts taking into account master settlement agreements that allow for netting of payments and excluding collateral received was billion at december   compared with million at december  we expect the credit exposure on derivative contracts to fluctuate with both changes in interest rates and implied volatility 
we held billion of collateral through custodians for derivative instruments at december  and million of collateral at december  assuming the highly unlikely event that all of our derivative counterparties to which fannie mae was exposed at december  were to default simultaneously  it would have cost an estimated million to replace the economic value of those contracts 
this replacement cost represents approximately percent of our pre tax core business earnings

in comparison  five counterparties rated aa or better by s p and aa or better by moody s accounted for percent of our net exposure of million at december  the percentage of our net exposure with counterparties rated aa or better by s p and aa or better by moody s fell during because of a change in the relative mix of our derivative products in response to changes in market conditions that shifted the relative level of activity and exposure between individual counterparties 
we mitigate our net exposure on derivative transactions through a collateral management policy  which consists of four primary components minimum collateral thresholds  collateral valuation percentages  overcollateralization based on rating downgrades  and daily monitoring procedures 
minimum collateral thresholds derivative counterparties are obligated to post collateral to fannie mae when we are exposed to credit losses exceeding agreed upon thresholds that are based on counterparty credit ratings 
we determine the collateral amount that counterparties are required to post based on their credit rating and our level of credit exposure 
the amount of collateral generally must equal the excess of fannie mae s exposure over the threshold amount

table of contents us treasury securities with a small amount of agency mbs 
all of the collateral posted by our counterparties was in the form of cash or us treasury securities at december  we assign each type of collateral a specific valuation percentage based on its relative risk 
for example  cash receives a percent valuation  while certain us treasury instruments may receive only a percent valuation percentage 
in cases where the valuation percentage for a certain type of collateral is less than percent  we require counterparties to post an additional amount of collateral to meet their requirements 
overcollateralization based on low credit ratings we further reduce our net exposure on derivatives by generally requiring overcollateralization from counterparties whose credit ratings have dropped below predetermined levels 
counterparties falling below these levels must post collateral beyond the amounts previously noted to meet their overall requirements

working with the business unit leaders  regional customer management teams ensure that pricing and transaction terms are structured appropriately to meet the unique needs and risks of fannie mae s various lender partners 
regional officers have credit authority to make credit decisions or develop customized mortgage solutions up to certain thresholds as outlined in the credit risk policy committee s written delegation of authority 
delegating certain credit authority and responsibility to our regional offices has allowed us to work closely with our lender partners  which has been integral to achieving a track record of effective credit risk management 
mortgage credit risk our mortgage credit risk stems from our mortgage credit book of business  where we bear the risk that borrowers fail to make payments required on their mortgages 
our mortgage credit book of business consists of mortgages we own  mortgages and mbs we guarantee  and other contractual arrangements or guarantees 
the credit guaranty business manages our mortgage credit risk 
we are exposed to credit risk on our mortgage credit book of business because we either own the assets or have guaranteed the timely payment of scheduled principal and interest to third parties 
for example  in the event of the default of a borrower on a mortgage underlying an mbs  we absorb any losses  net of the proceeds of any credit enhancements  that result and pay to the mbs investor all accrued interest and the full outstanding principal balance of the defaulted loan 
a certain level of credit losses is an inherent consequence of engaging in the credit guaranty business 
our risk management focus is on controlling the level and volatility of credit losses that result from changes in economic conditions

fannie mae s overall objective in managing mortgage credit risk is to deliver consistent earnings growth and target returns on capital in a wide range of economic environments 
central elements of our approach include managing the profile and quality of mortgages in the mortgage credit book  using credit enhancements to reduce credit losses  assessing the sensitivity of the profitability of the mortgage credit book of business to changes in composition and the economic environment  and managing problem assets to mitigate credit losses 
given the important differences in the nature and management of credit risk between single family and multifamily loans  we manage and discuss these two types of loans separately 

table of contents single family the single family mortgage credit book primarily consists of loans  mbs in our mortgage portfolio  mbs and other mortgage related securities guaranteed by fannie mae and held by other investors outstanding mbs  and other mortgage related securities we own backed by loans on properties that have four or fewer residential units 
this section details our single family risk management practices  risk characteristics  and performance 
while we manage the credit risk on the entire single family mortgage credit book  in some cases we may not have certain loan level information to report risk characteristics and performance disclosures 
therefore  unless otherwise noted  the credit statistics on fannie mae s conventional single family mortgage credit book presented in this section will generally include only mortgage loans in portfolio  mbs in portfolio  and outstanding mbs where we have more comprehensive  detailed loan level transaction information 
these loans represent percent of our single family mortgage credit book at the end of most of the remaining percent of our conventional single family mortgage credit book consists of mortgage related securities rated aaa at acquisition  including mortgage related securities guaranteed by freddie mac and ginnie mae 
managing the profile and quality of mortgages in the single family mortgage credit book 
mortgage credit risk on a particular single family loan is affected by numerous characteristics  including the type of loan  the down payment amount  and the strength of the borrower s credit history 
these and other factors  such as home price appreciation  affect both the level of expected credit loss on a given loan and the sensitivity of that loss to changes in the economic environment 
we attempt to understand the overall credit risk in our loans  earn an attractive risk adjusted return from appropriate guaranty fee pricing  and mitigate our risks through the use of credit enhancements and effective asset management 
our risk mitigating activities reduce the incidence and severity of loss and minimize the volatility of credit losses  which helps fannie mae in achieving stable earnings growth and a competitive return on equity over time 
we establish detailed policies and employ various processes to validate that the characteristics of the loans purchased or guaranteed comply with key underwriting and eligibility criteria 
we also assess the characteristics and quality of a lender s loans and processes through an audit program and our customer relationship management teams 
mortgage loans that we buy or guarantee must comply with certain underwriting and eligibility characteristics to ensure that the overall risk of the particular loan is within acceptable limits 
lenders represent and warrant compliance with our asset acquisition requirements when they sell mortgage loans or securities to us or seek a guarantee from us 
we may require the lender to repurchase a loan or enforce some other remedy if we identify any deficiencies 
since  we have developed and refined du to assist lenders in underwriting and complying with our other loan eligibility criteria 
du consistently and objectively applies risk analytics  underwriting  and eligibility standards to prospective mortgage loans 
approximately percent of the single family conventional loans we purchased or guaranteed in were processed through du  up from percent in and percent in we also buy or guarantee loans underwritten manually or through other automated underwriting systems  subject to appropriate lender representations and warranties 
in certain circumstances involving use of automated underwriting  we may relieve lenders of a limited number of the standard representations and warranties 
using credit enhancements to reduce credit losses 
credit enhancements are contracts in which a third party agrees to pay fannie mae if there is a credit event  such as a loan default 
credit enhancements enable us to transform the risk and return profile of the mortgage credit book of business to be consistent with our objectives 
single family credit enhancements include primary loan level mortgage insurance  pool mortgage insurance  recourse arrangements with lenders  and other customized risk sharing contracts 
the majority of our single family credit enhancement is primary loan level mortgage insurance 
when we require primary loan level mortgage insurance on loans with loan to value ratios above percent  we typically require greater coverage than the minimum level of credit enhancement required by our charter act if primary mortgage insurance is the only source used to meet our credit enhancement requirement 
subject to our policies and to the homeowners protection act of  primary loan level mortgage insurance can be 
table of contents cancelled either automatically or at the borrower s option in certain circumstances where the loan to value ratio has decreased below percent 
we also may require or acquire supplemental credit enhancement on loans based on risk and pricing 
while credit enhancements reduce our mortgage related credit losses  they also generate institutional counterparty risk that we discuss in the institutional counterparty credit risk section 
we focus credit enhancement coverage on loans in our mortgage credit book of business with a higher risk profile 
the percentage of our conventional single family credit book of business with credit enhancements was percent at december   down from percent at december  the decrease in credit enhancement coverage during was primarily due to the high level of refinance loans acquisitions with lower loan to value ratios that did not require credit enhancement 
because of the lower risk profile of these loans  we elected not to purchase credit enhancement on these loans 
assessing the sensitivity of the profitability of the single family mortgage credit book of business to changes in composition and the economic environment 
we use analytical tools to measure credit risk exposures  assess performance of our single family mortgage credit book of business  and evaluate risk management alternatives 
we continually refine our methods of measuring credit risk  setting risk and return targets  and transferring risk to third parties 
we use our analytical models to establish forecasts and expectations for the credit performance of loans in the mortgage credit book of business and compare actual performance to those expectations 
comparison of actual versus projected performance and changes in other key trends may signal a change in risk or return profiles and provide the basis for changing policies  standards  guidelines  credit enhancements  or guaranty fees 
for example  we use models to project guaranty fee income and credit losses  including forgone interest on nonperforming assets  for the single family mortgage credit book across a wide range of potential interest rate and home price environments 
we use current data on home values  borrower payment patterns  non mortgage consumer credit history  and management s economic outlook to assess our sensitivity to credit losses 
we closely examine a range of potential economic scenarios to monitor the sensitivity of credit losses 
as part of our voluntary safety and soundness initiatives  we elected to disclose on a quarterly lagged basis the sensitivity of the present value of future single family credit losses to an immediate percent decline in home prices 
table shows the results at the end of   and our models indicate that home price movements are an important predictor of credit performance 
we selected a percent immediate decline in home prices because it is a stressful scenario 
based on housing data from ofheo  the national average rate of home price appreciation over the last twenty years has been about percent  while the lowest national average growth rate in any single year has been 
percent 
historical statistics from ofheo s housing index report indicate that there has never been a nationwide decline of percent in home prices within a one year period since the federal government began tracking this data in 
table of contents table single family credit loss sensitivity december  dollars in millions gross credit loss sensitivity projected credit risk sharing proceeds net credit loss sensitivity represents total economic credit losses  which include net chargeoffs recoveries  foreclosed property expenses  forgone interest  and the cost of carrying foreclosed properties 
measures the gross sensitivity of our expected future economic credit losses to an immediate percent decline in home values for all single family mortgages held in our single family mortgage credit book  followed by an increase in home prices at the rate projected by fannie mae s credit pricing models 
managing problem assets to mitigate credit losses 
we closely manage single family loans in partnership with the servicers of our loans to minimize both the frequency of foreclosure and the severity of loss in the event of foreclosure 
we have developed detailed servicing guidelines and work closely with the loan servicers to ensure that they take appropriate loss mitigation steps on our behalf 
our loan management strategy begins with payment collection guidelines and work rules designed to minimize the number of borrowers who fall behind on their obligations and help borrowers who are delinquent from falling further behind on their payments 
we seek alternative resolutions of problem loans to reduce the legal and management expenses associated with foreclosing on a home 
early intervention is critical to controlling credit expenses 
most of our servicers use risk profiler sm  a default prediction model created by fannie mae  to monitor the performance and risk of each loan and identify loans requiring problem loan management 
risk profiler uses credit risk indicators such as mortgage payment record  updated borrower credit data  current property values  and mortgage product characteristics to evaluate the risk of the loan 
in  percent of our conventional single family loans were scored through risk profiler  up from percent in we may pursue various resolutions of problem loans as an alternative to foreclosure  including repayment plans in which borrowers repay past due principal and interest over a reasonable period of time generally no longer than months through a temporarily higher monthly payment  loan modifications in which past due principal and interest  net of any borrower contribution  are added to the loan amount and recovered over the remaining life of the loan and other terms of the loan may be adjusted  deeds in lieu of foreclosure in which the borrower signs over title to the property without the added expense of a foreclosure proceeding  and preforeclosure sales in which the borrower  working with the servicer  sells the home and pays off all or part of the outstanding loan  accrued interest  and other expenses with the sale proceeds 
we use analytical models and work rules to determine which alternative resolution  if any  may be appropriate for each problem loan 
we track the ultimate performance of alternative resolutions and adjust our models and rules as appropriate 
of the loans that recover through modification and repayment plans  our performance experience after at least three years following the inception of such plans has been that approximately two thirds of these loans remain current or pay off in full 
if we acquire the property in the event of default  we seek to maximize the sales proceeds and ensure we receive all credit enhancement payments 
we maintain a centralized property disposition unit to manage the foreclosure process to minimize foreclosure costs 
table presents statistics on our problem loans for   and

single family mortgage credit book characteristics and performance economic conditions and home values strongly affect the credit risk profile of our single family mortgage credit book and our credit losses and impact the likelihood of default and the severity of any losses 
economic trends beginning in and extending through early  the us economy experienced a mild recession 
economic growth  as measured by the change in gdp  began to slowly recover in gdp growth was very robust at percent in the first quarter of  but fell to percent during the fourth quarter 
unemployment  a lagging economic indicator  peaked at percent in april  gradually declined to percent in september  before rising again to percent by year end 
in spite of these trends  home prices continued to grow at a rate above long term historical averages in although home price growth has slowed from the record levels attained in the past few years 
based on ofheo s fourth quarter house price index report  average home prices at the national level increased percent in no census region or state experienced negative home price growth in over the last five years  us home appreciation has averaged percent annually 
single family loan risk characteristics we monitor an array of risk characteristics to assess the sensitivity of our credit losses to economic changes 
some of these risk characteristics are described below and quantified in tables and we typically obtain the data for these statistics from the sellers or servicers of the mortgage loans 
we receive representations and warranties as to the accuracy of the information from those providing it 
except for quality assurance efforts  we do not independently verify the reported information 
we generally collect loan level statistics only on conventional single family mortgage loans held in our portfolio and loans backing fannie mae guaranteed mbs 
these loans  collectively  represent the vast majority of our single family mortgage credit book of business 
loan to value ltv ratio ltv ratio is the ratio of upb to the value of the property that serves as collateral 
original ltv is based on the value reported to fannie mae at acquisition of the loan 
current ltv is based on current upb and original value updated for subsequent changes in home values using fannie mae s internal home valuation models 
ltv ratio is a strong predictor of credit performance 
the likelihood of default and the gross severity of a loss in the event of default are lower as the ltv ratio decreases  all other factors held equal 
the estimated average current ltv ratio on the mortgage credit book of business which is a weighted average based on current upb increased marginally to percent at december  from percent at the end of  largely due to the substantial volume of new business purchased or guaranteed in that has not yet had the opportunity to experience home price appreciation 

table of contents product type product type is defined by the nature of the interest rate applicable to the mortgage fixed for the duration of the loan or adjustable subject to contractual terms and by the maturity of the loan 
we divide our business into three categories long term  fixed rate mortgages with original terms of greater than years  intermediate term  fixed rate mortgages with original terms of years or less  and adjustable rate mortgages arms of any term 
arms tend to have higher default risk than fixed rate loans  all other factors held equal 
our single family mortgage credit book of business continues to be heavily concentrated in long and intermediate term  fixed rate products that are generally regarded as lower risk investments 
at december   percent of our single family book of business consisted of long term  fixed rate or intermediate term  fixed rate mortgages 
property type we classify mortgages secured by housing with up to four living units as single family 
mortgages on one unit properties tend to have lower credit risk than mortgages on multiple unit properties  such as duplexes  all other factors held equal 
the majority of fannie mae s book of business consists of loans secured by one unit properties 
the proportion of loans secured by multiple unit properties has remained relatively stable over the past two years 
occupancy type borrowers may purchase a home as a primary residence  second or vacation home  or investment rental property 
mortgages on properties occupied by the borrower as a principal or second residence tend to have lower credit risk than mortgages on investment properties  all other factors held equal 
the vast majority of fannie mae s book of business consists of mortgages on properties occupied by the borrower as the principal residence 
the proportion of loans secured by investment properties has remained relatively stable over the past three years 
credit score borrower credit history is a record of the use and repayment of varying forms of credit by the borrower 
since this information is typically complex and voluminous  statistical models are employed to summarize the information typically into a single numeric indicator of borrower credit quality 
we use several internal proprietary models to assess borrower credit quality at acquisition 
credit score is one measure often used by the financial services industry  and by fannie mae in some cases  to assess borrower credit quality 
credit scores are generated by credit repositories and calculated based on proprietary statistical models that evaluate many types of information on a borrower s credit report and compare this information to the patterns in other credit reports 
one statistical model used widely in the financial services industry was developed by fair  isaac company  inc fair isaac 
this model is used to create a credit score called the fico score 
fico scores can vary depending on which credit repository is using the fair isaac model to supply the score 
fico scores  as reported by the credit repositories  may range from a low of to a high of according to fair isaac  a high fico score indicates a lesser degree of risk 
a higher credit score is an indicator of lower default risk  while a lower credit score indicates higher risk  all other factors held equal 
on approximately two thirds of the mortgages on which we acquire credit risk through purchase or guaranty  lenders provide credit scores that typically reflect the borrower s credit history just prior to our acquisition of the loan 
for most of the remaining loans  we obtain credit scores soon after acquisition 
for a small proportion of loans  credit scores are not available 
the credit score of an individual borrower can vary depending upon several factors  including the timing of when the score is calculated and the credit repository from which the score is obtained 
management believes  however  that the average credit score across our book of business is a strong indicator of default risk within the single family mortgage credit book of business 
the credit quality of borrowers in our book remained high at december   as evidenced by an average credit score of at the time of loan purchase or guarantee 
loan purpose loan purpose indicates how the borrower intends to use the funds 
we designate the loan purpose as either purchase  cash out refinance  or other refinance 
the funds in a purchase transaction are used to acquire a property 
the funds in a cash out refinance transaction are used for purposes other than to pay off an existing first mortgage lien  to pay off any permissible subordinate mortgage liens  and to provide limited unrestricted cash proceeds to the borrower 
all other refinance transactions are defined as other refinancings 
cash out refinance transactions generally have a higher risk profile than purchase or other refinance transactions  all other factors held equal 
the significant 
table of contents refinance activity of the past two years resulted in a substantial shift in the proportion of refinance loans in our conventional single family mortgage credit book to percent at december  from percent at the end of geographic concentration local economic conditions affect borrowers ability to repay loans and the value of the collateral underlying a loan  all other factors held equal 
we analyze geographic exposure at a variety of levels of geographic aggregation  including at the regional level 
geographic diversification reduces mortgage credit risk  and our geographic distributions have been consistently well diversified 
we have significant business volumes in the west  with percent at the end of   and however  this exposure is low relative to the distribution of the overall mortgage market because of our conforming loan limit  which restricts us in serving the financing needs of borrowers in higher cost areas such as california 
loan age we closely track year of origination and loan age  defined as the number of years since origination 
the peak ages for default are from three to seven years after origination 
the average age of our portfolio has decreased in the past year largely due to the high level of refinancings 
as of december   approximately percent of our portfolio was three years old or less and only percent of the loans were in the peak default years  down from percent at the end of at december   percent of the loans were three years old or less 
at the end of  percent were three years old or less and percent were within their peak default years

serious delinquency a key measure of credit performance and future defaults for the single family mortgage credit book is the serious delinquency rate  although not all loans that become seriously delinquent result in a default 
a serious delinquency occurs when a borrower has missed three or more consecutive monthly payments  and the loan has not yet been brought current or been extinguished through foreclosure  payoff  or other resolution 
a loan referred to foreclosure but not yet foreclosed is also considered seriously delinquent 
the serious delinquency rate is the number of mortgages that are seriously delinquent divided by the total number of loans outstanding 
the rate at which new loans become seriously delinquent and the rate at which existing seriously delinquent loans are resolved significantly affects the level of future credit losses 
effective december   we changed how we report our single family serious delinquency rate to be more consistent with our current business and credit risk management practices 
traditionally  we reported our single family serious delinquency rate for those loans where we have the primary risk of default 
for example  we did not include loans that had substantial recourse to lenders or were covered by significant supplemental pool insurance from mortgage insurance companies in our serious delinquency statistics 
a significant portion of our business represents loans where we bear some risk  but share a portion of that risk with others 
as a result  we believe it is more meaningful to report our single family delinquency rate on all of our conventional loans and distinguish between loans on which we benefit from credit enhancement and loans on which we do not benefit from credit enhancement 
we have reclassified prior period statistics to conform to the current year s presentation 
table compares the serious delinquency rates for conventional single family loans with credit enhancements and without credit enhancements 
table conventional single family serious delinquency rates serious serious serious book delinquency book delinquency book delinquency outstanding rate outstanding rate outstanding rate credit enhanced non credit enhanced total conventional loans reported based on unpaid principal balance

for conventional loans in our single family mortgage credit book  our total serious delinquency rate increased modestly to

nonperforming single family loans we stop accruing interest on single family loans that we own  including delinquent loans purchased from an mbs trust pursuant to the terms of the trust indenture  when a principal and interest on these loans is at least days past due and b collection of principal and interest is doubtful 
these loans are classified as nonperforming 
table provides a summary for each of the past five years of the following information on our single family nonperforming loans the amount of nonaccrual loans that we owned within our single family mortgage portfolio at the end of each year  the amount of forgone interest income that we would have recorded each year if these loans had performed according to contractual terms during the year  and the amount of interest income recognized during the year on the loans when they were performing 
table nonperforming single family loans dollars in millions nonaccrual loans at december interest income forgone interest income recognized during year accruing loans past due days and greater at december forgone interest income represents the amount of interest income that would have been recorded during the year on nonperforming loans at december had the loans performed according to contractual terms 
represents estimated interest income recognized during the year on loans classified as nonperforming at december principal balance of loans at december that are days or greater past due and continuing to accrue interest because we believe collection of principal and interest is reasonably assured 
forgone interest income on non accrual loans increased significantly in because we purchased a higher level of seriously delinquent loans out of mbs pools and added them to our portfolio 
we take this action pursuant to the terms of the relevant securities when the cost of advancing interest to mbs investors at the security coupon rate exceeds the cost of holding the nonperforming loan in our mortgage portfolio 
any net interest remitted to mbs investors but not received from the servicer is included as part of the charge offs should the loan be foreclosed 
subsequent to a decision to purchase the seriously delinquent loan out of the mbs  the cost of holding the loan in our portfolio is reflected as a reduction to net interest income 
we may recover a portion of forgone interest income when we liquidate foreclosed properties and collect credit enhancement proceeds 
single family credit losses the application of various credit risk management strategies throughout a loan s life helped minimize single family credit losses in despite weak economic conditions 
single family credit losses include charge offs plus foreclosed property expense income 
interest forgone on nonperforming loans and other assets in our mortgage portfolio  which is presented in table  reduces our net interest income but is not reflected in our credit loss total 
as shown in table  single family credit related losses decreased million in to million

strong housing prices helped boost recoveries on foreclosed properties  which offset the increase in foreclosed property expense associated with a larger number of foreclosed properties 
the number of properties acquired through foreclosure increased to  in from  in  contributing to a million increase in charge offs 
while the number of acquired properties increased percent credit related losses fell by million as average severities continued to drop  especially in the northeast and west regions where foreclosure costs had been higher in the recent past 
this trend is primarily due to the effect of strong home prices and proceeds from credit enhancements 
finally  low interest rates led us to repurchase a higher level of seriously delinquent loans out of mbs  resulting in an increased amount of forgone interest income

multifamily we also purchase or guarantee loans on multifamily properties properties with more than four residential units 
we provide financing either in the form of a single asset loan  principally through the delegated underwriting and servicing dus product line  or through a negotiated transaction involving a pool of multifamily properties 
the principal credit risks of multifamily property financings involve the following physical condition and financial performance of the property market conditions in the geographic location of the property 
table of contents ability and intent of the borrower to repay the loan structure of the financing managing the profile and quality of mortgages in the multifamily mortgage credit book 
numerous characteristics impact the mortgage credit risk on a particular multifamily loan 
these characteristics include the type of mortgage loan  the type and location of the property  the condition and value of the property  counterparty strength  and the current and anticipated cash flows on the property 
these and other factors affect both the amount of expected credit loss on a given loan and the sensitivity of that loss to changes in the economic environment 
we attempt to understand and control the overall risk in each loan we purchase or guarantee 
under the dus product line  we purchase or securitize mortgages from approved risk sharing lenders without prior review of the mortgages if the mortgages are less than million 
lenders represent and warrant that dus loans they originate are consistent with our underwriting requirements 
approximately percent of our multifamily mortgage credit book consisted of dus products or business at december   compared with percent at the end of we manage multifamily mortgage credit risk throughout the investment life cycle 
the cycle begins with the formulation of sound underwriting and servicing policies and procedures 
when application of these policies and procedures is delegated to our lending partners  we actively monitor results through post purchase underwriting reviews of loans delivered to us 
we conduct on site assessments of dus lenders servicing and their financial condition 
we closely track property condition and financial performance throughout the life of the assets we finance 
we also evaluate borrower  geographic  and other types of risk concentrations at the loan and portfolio level 
using credit enhancements to reduce credit losses 
we use credit enhancements to transform the risk and return profile of multifamily loans that we purchase or guarantee consistent with our corporate credit risk management objectives 
in most of our business arrangements  lenders in the dus product line bear losses on the first five percent of upb and share in remaining losses up to a prescribed limit 
on structured transactions  we generally have full or partial recourse to lenders or third parties for loan losses 
the recourse provider may back up its obligation with letters of credit  investment agreements  or pledged collateral 
third party recourse providers for structured and other transactions include government and private mortgage insurers 
while credit enhancements reduce our mortgage related credit losses  they also generate institutional counterparty risk  which we discuss further in the institutional counterparty credit risk section 
we seek to concentrate credit enhancement coverage on the riskier loans

table of contents assessing the sensitivity of the profitability of the multifamily mortgage credit book of business to changes in composition and the economic environment 
we use analytical tools to measure credit risk exposures  assess performance of our book  and evaluate risk management alternatives 
we combine these analyses with assessments of any problem loan situations to develop forecasts of future guaranty fee revenue and credit losses 
we carefully monitor the relevant local market economic indicators that may signal changing risk or return profiles in the book and cause a change in risk management policies  credit enhancements  or guaranty fees 
for example  we closely monitor rental payment trends and vacancy levels in local markets to identify loans meriting closer attention or loss mitigation actions 
managing problem assets to mitigate credit losses 
as part of our risk management activities  we perform detailed loss reviews  address borrower and geographic concentrations  assess lender qualifications  evaluate counterparty risk  and track property performance and contract compliance 
the loss mitigation team manages troubled assets from default through foreclosure and property disposition  if necessary 
given the size of multifamily loans  we generally require servicers to submit periodic operating information and property condition reviews to monitor the performance of individual loans 
we use this information to evaluate the credit quality of our book  identify potential problem loans  and initiate appropriate loss mitigation activities 
multifamily mortgage credit book performance the economic downturn in the us economy had a modest impact on multifamily credit losses in because property values have remained strong 
if the economy weakens further and property values decline  we would anticipate a higher level of credit losses in than we have experienced in the recent past 
multifamily credit related losses totaled million in  up million from the higher level of credit losses in was due primarily to two large properties in the midwest 
although the level of multifamily losses increased in  we have had historically low credit loss ratios of less than basis points over the past three years as shown in table table multifamily credit loss performance year ended december  dollars in millions charge offs foreclosed property expense credit related losses credit loss ratio serious delinquency rate properties acquired through foreclosure prior year numbers have been restated to reflect our new method of reporting delinquencies and include fannie mae s credit enhancement of housing bonds issued by state and local government entities 
multifamily serious delinquencies include loans that are days or more past due 
we base the multifamily serious delinquency rate on the upb of delinquent loans divided by the upb of multifamily loans we own or guarantee 
our multifamily serious delinquency rate declined to 
percent at year end from 
percent at the end of at the end of  our multifamily serious delinquency rate was 
percent 
the increase in was due to two seriously delinquent loans totaling million on properties in new york city affected by the world trade center disaster 
these obligations were restructured or became current in 
table of contents over the last three years  multifamily credit losses and serious delinquencies have been at historically low levels 
management anticipates that multifamily credit losses  over time  will return to a level more reflective of the current economic environment 
we generally stop accruing interest on multifamily loans that we own when principal and interest on these loans is days past due and collection of principal and interest is doubtful 
table summarizes the amount of nonaccrual multifamily loans at december  through december  in addition  it identifies the amount of interest income that we would have recorded during those periods if nonperforming loans had performed according to contractual terms during the year  the amount of interest income accrued on those loans during the portion of the year when they were performing  and the amount of any interest income accrued on loans past days due 
table nonperforming multifamily loans dollars in millions nonaccrual loans at december interest income forgone interest income recognized during year accruing loans past due days and greater at december forgone interest income represents the amount of interest income that would have been recorded during the year on nonperforming loans at december had the loans performed according to contractual terms 
represents estimated interest income recognized during the year on loans classified as nonperforming at december principal balance of loans at december that are days or greater past due and continuing to accrue interest because we believe collection of principal and interest is reasonably assured 
equity financing for multifamily properties we also provide equity financing for multifamily properties 
equity financing typically takes the form of limited partnership investments in affordable housing projects that produce low income housing tax credits 
the tax benefits we receive from these properties represents our primary economic return on our equity investments 
because our equity financings have the same property related credit risks as other multifamily financings  we track property condition and financial performance throughout the life of these investments 
we also evaluate the strength of our investment sponsors and third party asset managers through periodic financial and operational assessments 
approximately percent of our equity investments in low income housing tax credit properties have an economic return guaranteed by an investment grade counterparty 
internal revenue service requirements govern the recognition of tax credits 
these requirements include maintaining the properties with a specified level of affordable housing units over a year period 
failure to meet irs requirements can trigger a recapture of tax credits from the irs 
for the years ended december    and the amounts of tax credit recapture were not significant 
institutional counterparty credit risk a secondary credit risk is the possibility that institutional counterparties may be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations to us 
for example  our credit losses would increase if a credit enhancement counterparty were unable to reimburse us in the event of loss on a covered mortgage loan 
accepting a certain level of counterparty risk is integral to our interest rate and credit risk management and liquidity objectives 
we have a dedicated counterparty risk management team that quantifies aggregate counterparty risk exposures across business activities  maintains a corporate credit policy framework for managing counterparty risk  and manages the counterparty risk associated with mortgage insurance companies 

table of contents our overall objective in managing institutional counterparty credit risk is to maintain individual counterparty exposures within a range that allows us to achieve our overall financial performance objective of stable and predictable earnings 
central elements of our approach to managing institutional counterparty credit risk include stringent counterparty eligibility standards appropriate to each exposure type and level  collateralization of exposures where appropriate  policies to ensure our counterparty exposures are diversified to avoid excessive concentration of risk  and intensive exposure monitoring and management 
maintaining stringent counterparty eligibility standards appropriate to each exposure type 
we generally require that our counterparties have an investment grade credit rating 
a rating of bbb baa bbb or higher by standard poor s  moody s investor service  and fitch  respectively  is considered an investment grade rating 
for mortgage insurance counterparties  we have generally required a minimum rating of aa aa for our risk sharing  recourse  and mortgage servicing counterparties  we do not always require an investment grade credit rating because we believe the risk of loss is lower 
we have ongoing  extensive mortgage purchase and mortgage servicing relationships with these counterparties 
in some instances  we also have collateral  letters of credit  or investment agreements to secure the obligation 
individual business units maintain policies and procedures governing the eligibility of counterparties and approval requirements for accepting exposure to them 
for example  we maintain requirements governing eligibility of insurers to provide primary loan level mortgage insurance on single family loans we buy or guarantee 
we conduct a comprehensive counterparty analysis before approving a mortgage insurance company 
we review a mortgage insurer s business plan  financial statements  insurance portfolio characteristics  master insurance policies  reinsurance treaties  and ratings on ability to pay claims 
we monitor approved insurers through a quarterly reporting and analysis process combined with onsite business reviews 
requiring collateralization of exposures  where appropriate 
we may require collateral  letters of credit  or investment agreements as a condition to accepting exposure to a particular counterparty 
we may also require that a counterparty post collateral in the event of an adverse event such as a ratings downgrade 
we also have contractual rights that can offset exposure in the event of a counterparty default 
for example  if an insurer cannot provide mortgage insurance in accordance with our requirements  most of our mortgages have provisions that allow us to use borrower paid mortgage insurance premiums to obtain substantially equivalent protection 
if this insurance is unavailable at an acceptable cost  we can retain the premium and use it to obtain other credit enhancement or as a loss reserve 
similarly  we have the contractual right to terminate a single family or multifamily lender s status as a servicer in the event the lender fails to fulfill its servicing obligations or fails to reimburse fannie mae for losses that the lender assumed 
in that event  we would either sell the servicing rights or use the servicing fees to offset any losses related to the lender s failure 
establishing policies to ensure diversification of our exposure 
we monitor counterparty exposure in total by industry and by individual counterparty 
in addition  we have established exposure tolerance levels by counterparty based on our assessment of each counterparty s credit strength 
these tolerance thresholds allow us to prioritize our monitoring activities and avoid excessive concentrations of credit risk 
monitoring and managing exposures intensively within business lines and across fannie mae 
individual business units are responsible for managing the counterparty exposures routinely associated with their activities 
the counterparty risk management team reviews business unit policies  procedures  and approval authorities  and the credit risk policy committee approves these internal controls 
non derivative institutional counterparty risk primarily includes exposure created by mortgage insurance policies  other credit enhancement arrangements with lenders and others  mortgage servicing contracts with lenders  and liquidity investments in corporate obligations or nonmortgage asset backed securities 

table of contents lenders with risk sharing the primary risk associated with lenders where we have risk sharing agreements is that they will fail to reimburse us for losses as required under these agreements 
we had recourse to lenders for losses on single family loans totaling an estimated billion at december  and billion at december  the quality of these counterparties is high  with investment grade counterparties accounting for percent and percent of lender recourse obligations at the end of and  respectively 
we also require some lenders to pledge collateral to secure their recourse obligations 
at december  and  we held million and million in collateral  respectively  to secure single family lender recourse transactions 
in addition  single family lenders with recourse obligations received servicing fees on trillion and trillion of mortgages at year end and  respectively 
a portion of these servicing fees effectively serves as collateral 
we had recourse to lenders on multifamily loans totaling billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
our multifamily recourse obligations were secured by reserves held in custodial accounts  insurance policies  letters of credit from investment grade counterparties rated a or better  and investment agreements 
in addition  all multifamily lenders with recourse obligations received servicing fees  a portion of which effectively serves as collateral 
mortgage servicers the primary risk associated with mortgage servicers is that they will fail to fulfill their servicing obligations 
mortgage servicers collect mortgage and escrow payments from borrowers  pay taxes and insurance costs from escrow accounts  monitor and report delinquencies  and perform other required activities on our behalf 
a servicing contract breach could result in credit losses for us  or we could incur the cost of finding a replacement servicer  which could be substantial for loans that require a specialized servicer 
we mitigate this risk by requiring mortgage servicers to maintain a minimum reserve servicing fee rate to compensate a replacement servicer in the event of a servicing contract breach 
we also manage this risk by requiring servicers to follow specific servicing guidelines and by monitoring each servicer s performance using loan level data 
we conduct on site reviews of compliance with servicing guidelines and mortgage servicing performance 
we also work on site with nearly all of our major servicers to facilitate loan loss mitigation efforts and improve the default management process 
in addition  we review quarterly financial information on servicers 
our ten largest single family mortgage servicers serviced percent of our single family book of business at the end of and fannie mae s largest multifamily mortgage servicers serviced percent of our multifamily book of business at year end  compared with percent at year end we have purchased mortgage related securities secured by manufacturing housing that were issued by entities other than fannie mae both for our portfolio and  to a limited extent  for securitization into remic securities we have issued and guaranteed 
we currently own or guarantee approximately billion of these securities 
due to weakness in the manufactured housing sector and the financial condition of conseco finance corp  which services approximately percent of these securities  the major securities rating agencies downgraded several of the securities 
as of december   the vast majority of these securities were rated aa or better  and the entire billion of securities either had investment grade ratings or were insured by counterparties which had investment grade ratings 
management believes that any potential impairment that might be recorded in the future will not be material to fannie mae s operating results 
on march   the us bankruptcy court for the northern district of illinois issued a final order approving the servicing arrangements for the securities serviced by conseco finance corp 
the order  based upon an agreement reached between conseco finance  cfn investment holdings the new owner and servicer  fannie mae and other certificate holders  provided for revised servicing fees and an enhanced servicing protocol 
cfn is expected to complete the acquisition in the second quarter of mortgage insurers the primary risk associated with mortgage insurers is that they will fail to fulfill their obligations to reimburse us for claims under insurance policies 
we were the beneficiary of primary mortgage insurance coverage on billion of single family loans in portfolio or underlying mbs at december  and 
table of contents billion at december  seven mortgage insurance companies  all rated aa or higher by standard poor s  provided approximately percent of the total coverage at the end of and liquid investments the primary credit risk associated with our liquid investments  which includes the lip  our early funding portfolio  and cash and cash equivalents  is that issuers will not repay us in accordance with contractual terms 
the level of credit risk in our liquid investments is low because these investments are primarily high quality  short and medium term investments 
these investments include our early funding portfolio  which consists primarily of repurchase agreements  and other high quality short term investments in nonmortgage assets  such as federal funds and time deposits  commercial paper  asset backed securities  and corporate floating rate notes 
the majority of our nonmortgage asset backed securities are rated aaa by standard poor s 
unsecured investments in the portfolio are generally rated a or higher by standard poor s 
our lip  which accounts for the majority of our liquid investments  totaled billion and billion at the end of and  respectively 
approximately percent of our lip had a credit rating of a or higher at december   compared with percent at december  operations risk management operations risk is the risk of potential loss resulting from a breakdown in  or failure to establish  controls and procedures 
examples of control breakdowns include circumvention of internal controls  human error  systems failure and fraud 
management has implemented extensive policies and procedures to both establish and monitor internal controls to decrease the likelihood of any control breakdowns 
fannie mae s office of auditing also independently tests the adequacy of  and adherence to  internal controls and related policies and procedures 
we actively manage fannie mae s operations risk through numerous oversight functions  such as exception reporting and management oversight of financial and forecasting information through verification  reconciliation and independent testing management questionnaires that identify key risks  controls in place to mitigate those risks  and control weaknesses key performance indicators kpis that track operational metrics and potential risk exposure quarterly senior and executive management internal control certifications internal audit work that substantiates the adequacy of the internal control environment as well as direct reporting of this work to the audit committee of the board of directors comprehensive disaster recovery planning and testing management regularly reconciles financial and accounting information and model results to source documents to ensure completeness and accuracy of financial reporting 
financial forecast model results are regularly reconciled to actual results and the models are recalibrated as necessary to mitigate modeling risk 
the office of auditing also periodically benchmarks the critical models  evaluates the reasonableness of the underlying assumptions  and validates the key algorithms embedded within them 
control weaknesses are identified as well as the steps being taken to address them 
the office of auditing reviews and validates these assessments for reasonableness and accuracy 
kpis have been established to monitor primary operational metrics and to facilitate quick and effective senior management attention should any adverse trends develop 
kpis focus on the following operational risks modeling losses due to improperly modeled interest rate risk and credit risk underwriting effectiveness losses due to the failure of management or our lender counterparties to apply appropriate underwriting techniques counterparty losses due to inadequate monitoring and risk mitigation resulting in exposure to counterparties who fail to meet their obligations to fannie mae 
these counterparties include 
table of contents lender servicers  providers of credit enhancement  document custodians  derivatives counterparties  and other service providers transaction processing losses due to inadequate transaction processing controls  such as ineffective management oversight and reconciliation processes 
examples include erroneous wire transfers or loan deliveries  fraud  trade failures  or release of inaccurate securities information systems availability inability to achieve corporate goals due to a lack of systems availability  consistent performance  or capacity to recover from a disaster information security financial loss and incurrence of additional liability due to unauthorized systems access  corruption or destruction of critical  proprietary or confidential data mission alignment ineffective leadership or inappropriate business models resulting in litigation  regulatory sanctions  and reputation damage due to noncompliance with applicable laws  regulations  and charter act requirements financial reporting economic and reputational loss or disruption due to erroneous or delayed release of financial reports each kpi is based upon clearly defined and quantifiable performance thresholds that are monitored by our office of auditing 
senior managers are responsible for evaluating and monitoring kpi activity as well as implementing prompt corrective action 
the office of auditing also tests the integrity of this process on a periodic basis 
the operations  transactions and investments committee headed by our chief operating officer reviews the kpis and ensures prompt and effective resolutions 
on a quarterly basis  senior and executive management certify that internal controls are adequate  questionnaires and kpis are accurate  and that all significant issues or control weaknesses that could have a material impact on the financial statements have been disclosed 
the office of auditing reviews these certifications for reasonableness 
the quarterly certifications are one of the key inputs for our chief executive officer and chief financial officer s written certifications that our financial statements fairly present fannie mae s financial condition and results of operations in all material respects 
in addition to the oversight functions indicated above  the office of auditing assesses risk and the underlying control environment annually throughout the company and then implements a comprehensive audit plan to assess risk and validate key controls 
the office of auditing also performs third party audits as an important part of assessing counterparty exposure as well as to further substantiate adequacy of related internal controls 
a primary example is performing audits of entities that sell loans to fannie mae or who service loans for us 
in these audits  we evaluate the financial and operational controls of these entities by reviewing the financial statements and assessing compliance with our net worth and insurance coverage requirements to assess eligibility and capability of doing business with us  testing cash and custodial accounting controls to ensure both fannie mae and borrower funds are held in qualified institutions and that the funds are properly accounted for  safeguarded and remitted 
determining that key controls associated with loan underwriting  accounting  reporting and servicing are in place and operating effectively  that activity is reported to us accurately and that our mortgage assets are protected 
fannie mae has also developed comprehensive disaster recovery plans covering both systems and business operations that are designed to restore critical operations with minimal interruption 
major elements of this plan are tested annually at established contingency sites 
controls and procedures within days prior to the date of this report  we carried out an evaluation  under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer  of the effectiveness of our 
table of contents disclosure controls and procedures 
based on this evaluation  our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective 
disclosure controls and procedures are controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information we disclose in our periodic reports is recorded  processed  summarized  and reported within the designated time periods 
in addition  based on this most recent evaluation  we have concluded that there were no significant changes in our internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect these controls subsequent to the date of their last evaluation  including any corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses 
liquidity and capital resources fannie mae s statutory mission requires that we provide ongoing assistance to the secondary market for mortgages 
our ability to continually raise low cost capital is critical to fulfilling our housing mission of providing liquidity to the secondary mortgage market and promoting homeownership to low and moderate income families 
we primarily rely on debt to purchase mortgage assets and to supply liquidity to the secondary market 
in  our mortgage asset purchases totaled billion based on unpaid principal balance 
we issued trillion in debt to fund those purchases and to replace maturing  called or repurchased debt 
we take a long term approach to our funding and capital management strategy because of our continuous requirements for large amounts of funding 
fannie mae s liquidity and capital position is actively managed to preserve stable  reliable  and cost effective sources of cash to meet all current and future normal operating financial commitments  meet our regulatory capital requirements  and handle any unforeseen liquidity crisis 
liquidity fannie mae s primary sources of liquidity include proceeds from the issuance of debt  principal and interest received on our mortgage portfolio  guaranty fees earned on our mbs  and principal and interest received on our liquid investment portfolio 
primary uses of liquidity include the purchase of mortgage assets  repayment of debt  interest payments  administrative expenses  taxes  and fulfillment of fannie mae s mbs guaranty obligations 
our liquid assets totaled billion at december   compared with billion at december  in  we adopted the principles for sound liquidity management established by the basel committee on banking supervision as part of our voluntary safety and soundness initiatives 
these principles outline the appropriate structure for managing liquidity and market access  a process for measuring and monitoring net funding requirements  the need for contingency plans  the necessary controls for liquidity risk management  and the role of public disclosure and regulatory oversight 
we monitor our liquidity position through a combination of daily  weekly and monthly reports to help set strategies and make funding decisions 
our analyses include projected cash flows and funding needs  targeted funding terms and various funding alternatives for achieving those terms  cost of debt and the most efficient ways to achieve desired funding  and market conditions and upcoming economic indicators and other factors that could impact the capital markets and our funding capabilities 
we have historically had ready access to funding for the following reasons our credit quality in february  standard poor s assigned fannie mae a aa risk to the government rating 
in february  moody s investors service assigned us an a bank financial strength rating 
the highest possible levels for these ratings are aaa from standard poor s and a from moody s 
these ratings are continuously monitored by each rating agency 
additionally  our senior unsecured debt has been rated aaa  aaa  and aaa by fitch  inc  moody s investors service  and standard poor s  respectively 
fitch  moody s  and standard poor s rated our short term debt f  prime or p  and a  respectively 

table of contents our standing in the capital market we are an active participant in the global financial markets and one of the world s largest private issuers of debt securities 
our debt obligations are traded in the agency securities market 
the agency securities market includes securities issued by government sponsored enterprises gses 
while the us government does not guarantee our debt  directly or indirectly  securities issued by gses are typically perceived to be of high credit quality 
our efficiency we have demonstrated a long term commitment to investors in the organized way we bring debt issues to market and monitor performance in the secondary market 
we have successfully developed new funding products and markets with a variety of terms and features to appeal to a wide spectrum of investors 
in addition  we may transform the debt into terms and other features that better match our funding needs through our efficient use of derivatives 
given the importance of debt to our funding strategy  we have a contingency plan to protect us in the event of a major market disruption that would prevent us from issuing debt 
as part of our voluntary safety and soundness initiatives  we maintain contingency plans for handling a liquidity crisis under an assumption that we cannot access the new issue debt markets for a period of at least three months 
each day we update and analyze cash commitments and anticipated cash flows for the next days 
our analysis indicates how we expect to obtain funds during that period in the event we cannot access the capital markets 
in the event of a market disruption in which we could not issue debt  we could liquidate our liquid investment portfolio or borrow against our mortgage portfolio to meet our operational needs fannie mae s liquid investment portfolio primarily consists of high quality securities that are readily marketable or have short term maturities and serves as the primary means for ensuring that we maintain sufficient liquidity 
if our access to the debt capital markets is ever impeded  we first will utilize assets in our lip to generate the cash necessary to meet our liquidity needs 
our initial source of funds would come from the ongoing maturity of short term investments in the portfolio 
if additional funds were needed  we would sell assets from the lip to generate these funds 
as part of our voluntary commitments  we have publicly pledged to maintain a portfolio of high quality  liquid  nonmortgage related securities equal to at least percent of total on balance sheet assets 
our lip and other liquid assets together totaled billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
the ratio of our liquid assets to total assets was percent and percent at december  and  respectively 
fannie mae s mortgage portfolio consists of assets that could be pledged as collateral for financing in the repurchase agreement market 
we are able to borrow against fannie mae s mortgage assets in the market for mortgage repurchase agreements 
we test this capability through periodic issuance 
at december  and  we had approximately billion and billion  respectively  in eligible mortgage securities 
at december   we had billion in outstanding mandatory commitments and billion in outstanding optional commitments for the purchase and delivery of mortgages in at december   fannie mae had billion in outstanding mandatory commitments and billion in outstanding optional commitments for the purchase and delivery of mortgages in capital resources core capital defined by ofheo as the stated value of outstanding common stock  the stated value of outstanding noncumulative perpetual preferred stock  paid in capital  and retained earnings  less treasury stock grew to billion at december  from billion at december  core capital excludes accumulated other comprehensive income because aoci incorporates unrealized gains losses on derivatives and certain securities  but not the unrealized losses gains on the remaining mortgages and securities or liabilities used to fund the purchase of these items

table of contents at december   aoci totaled negative billion  compared with a negative balance of billion at december  upon adoption of fas on january   we recorded a billion reduction in aoci  which was primarily attributable to recording derivatives mostly pay fixed interest rate swaps that qualify as cash flow hedges on the balance sheet at fair value 
the decline in interest rates during and caused a decline in the fair value of these derivatives and has reduced aoci since the adoption of fas in conjunction with the adoption of fas  we also  in a non cash transfer  reclassified investment securities and mbs with an amortized cost of approximately billion and unrealized gains and unrealized losses of million and million  respectively  from held to maturity to available for sale 
on september   concurrent with the implementation of a new risk based capital rule issued by ofheo  we reclassified billion of securities in our mortgage and nonmortgage investment portfolios from held to maturity to available for sale in accordance with fas at the time of this noncash transfer  the securities had gross unrealized gains of billion and losses of million 
prior to ofheo s risk based capital rule  fannie mae was not subject to a risk based capital standard 
ofheo s new risk based capital rule establishes a risk weight for fannie mae s assets 
fas specifically identifies a significant increase in the risk weights of debt securities used for regulatory risk based capital purposes as a change in circumstance under which a company may reclassify securities from held to maturity to available for sale without calling into question the intent to hold other securities to maturity in the future

we issued billion of subordinated debt securities that received a rating of aa from standard poor s and aa from moody s investors service in subordinated debt serves as a supplement to our equity capital  although it is not a component of core capital 
it provides a risk absorbing layer to supplement core capital for the benefit of senior debt holders and is intended to serve as a consistent and early market signal of credit risk for investors 
by the end of  we intend to issue sufficient subordinated debt to bring the sum of total capital and outstanding subordinated debt to at least percent of on balance sheet assets  after providing adequate capital to support off balance sheet mbs 
total capital and outstanding subordinated debt represented percent of on balance sheet assets at december   compared with percent at december  regulatory environment fannie mae is subject to capital adequacy standards established by the federal housing enterprises financial safety and soundness act of act and continuous examination by ofheo  which was established by the act 
the capital adequacy standards require that our core capital equal or exceed a minimum capital standard and a critical capital standard 
the portfolios and capital committee  chaired by the chief financial officer  ensures compliance with economic and regulatory risk based capital requirements

the reclassification will not have a material effect on these amounts 
the act also established our risk based capital requirements  and it required ofheo to adopt regulations establishing a risk based capital test 
ofheo published regulations under the act in september  as amended on march   establishing a risk based capital test to determine the amount of total capital we must hold under the risk based capital standard on a quarterly basis 
ofheo implemented the risk based capital standard on september  at december   our risk based capital requirement was billion 
our total capital was billion at year end  billion higher than the risk based capital requirement 
performance outlook we expect fannie mae s core business earnings to continue to increase in  although at a growth rate below the above average trend rates of and we project that our net interest margin will move lower in as the benefits from the actions we took during and to lower our debt costs begin to diminish 
we anticipate some increase in our effective average guaranty fee rates because of recent pricing trends 
we also believe that while credit expenses may move higher in  they will remain at historically low levels 
should economic conditions deteriorate  we believe our book of business is well positioned to perform better than in prior slowdowns because of improved loan underwriting through desktop underwriter  lower loan to value ratios  more third party credit enhancements  and superior credit loss mitigation efforts 
our administrative expense growth rate should decline in but remain above historical levels as we complete our core infrastructure project and begin to expense stock based compensation 
see md a forward looking information 

table of contents new accounting standards accounting for stock compensation we elected to adopt the expense recognition provisions of financial accounting standard no 
fas  accounting for stock based compensation  effective january  in accordance with fas  we will recognize the fair value of stock based compensation at grant date over the service period of the employee as an administrative expense in our income statement 
we have elected to apply this change in accounting prospectively to all awards granted on january  and thereafter 
we will continue to account for stock based compensation awarded prior to january  under accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
we estimate that the impact of adopting the expense recognition provisions of fas will result in additional expense of approximately million in guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees in november  fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of other fin 
fin will primarily apply to guaranteed mbs issued to investors other than fannie mae on or after january  by fannie mae as trustee  and it will require that we recognize the fair value of our guarantee on mbs as an asset and the fair value of our guaranty obligations as a liability 
under fin  we will amortize our guaranty asset and liability amounts equally over the estimated life of the loans underlying the mbs as an adjustment to guaranty fee income 
there will be no effect on fannie mae s guaranty fee income or stockholders equity from adopting this accounting rule because the guaranty asset and liability will be equal under fin special purpose entities spes in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
fin provides guidance on when a company should include in its financial statements the assets  liabilities and activities of a variable interest entity vie 
under fin  a variable interest entity must be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
we have not identified any current fannie mae arrangements that meet the vie consolidation criteria of fin therefore  we do not believe that fin will have a material impact on fannie mae 
our off balance sheet mbs activities are outside the scope of fin because we conduct those activities through trusts that are qualifying spes 
our investments in low income housing tax credit partnerships are also outside the scope of fin because they do not meet the definition of variable interest entities
