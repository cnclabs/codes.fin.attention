our operations our consolidated financial statements include three distinct business segments us wireless  caribbean wireless and caribbean broadband 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
us wireless in the united states  we provide digital wireless service in two geographic clusters  covering approximately million net pops 
our midwest cluster includes parts of indiana  michigan and ohio  and our southeast cluster includes parts of louisiana  mississippi and texas 
our clusters are comprised of small cities and rural areas that generally have lower penetration levels and fewer competitors than major metropolitan areas 
through clustering  we believe we are able to achieve critical mass and operating efficiencies while developing a respected brand image within our service areas 
further  these clusters are near major metropolitan markets  and we benefit from the traffic generated by subscribers of other wireless service 
table of contents providers who roam into our coverage areas 
below are some key statistics regarding our us wireless business approximately  wireless subscribers at the end of fiscal  of which were postpaid  revenue of million for fiscal  an increase of from fiscal  operating income of million for fiscal  as compared to million for fiscal  adjusted operating income of million for fiscal  an increase of from fiscal  representing adjusted operating income margins of and in fiscal and  respectively  capital expenditures of million in fiscal  an increase of from fiscal  total monthly revenue including roaming revenue per wireless subscriber  or arpu  of for fiscal and for fiscal  and postpaid churn of and for fiscal and  respectively  and for the three months ended may   down from for the same period in we have long term roaming agreements with at t wireless services  inc and cingular wireless llc 
these roaming agreements enable us to offer nationwide plans at attractive rates and provide predictable roaming revenue for us 
we believe that the quality and coverage of our network provide us with a strategic advantage over our competitors 
we own mhz of spectrum in the mhz frequency band in each of our us wireless markets 
our network currently employs both analog and tdma time division multiple access digital technology 
we have begun to overlay our midwest cluster network with gsm global system for mobile communications technology that will support gprs general packet radio service advanced data technology and will align our technology with our largest roaming partners 
we expect to launch gsm service in the midwest cluster by the end of we intend to begin the overlay of our southeast cluster network with gsm technology after we complete the overlay of our midwest cluster  and we expect to launch gsm service in the southeast cluster in in connection with the at t wireless roaming agreement  at t wireless granted us two separate options to purchase mhz of spectrum covering an aggregate of approximately million pops in michigan and indiana that is contiguous to our midwest cluster for an aggregate price of million 
this option provides us with the opportunity to expand our us wireless operations 
we are still evaluating this business opportunity  which would require us to incur additional capital expenditures if we elected to build out our network in these areas 
the options expire in late and early caribbean region in the caribbean region  we have an established business with attractive adjusted operating income margins  substantial adjusted operating income and significant growth potential 
we offer wireless  wireline and cable television services in puerto rico  wireless and wireline services in the dominican republic and wireless services in the us virgin islands 
we derived approximately of our caribbean revenue for fiscal from our puerto rico operations 
puerto rico is a us dollar denominated and federal communications commission  or fcc  regulated commonwealth of the united states 
we believe wireless telecommunications services are experiencing significant growth in this region due to lower wireless penetration and lower wireline teledensity as compared to other parts of the united states 
we also believe that lower wireline teledensity has resulted in significant substitution of wireline services for wireless services 
this is evidenced by a increase in postpaid minutes of usage per month from for fiscal to for fiscal this compares to approximately minutes  according to the cellular telecommunications and internet association  for wireless subscribers in the united states for the twelve months ended december  for this reason  we focus on intensive postpaid users of service generating higher arpus 

table of contents caribbean wireless 
our caribbean wireless operations cover a population of approximately million and serve puerto rico  the dominican republic and the us virgin islands using the same digital technology  called cdma code division multiple access 
we launched wireless services in puerto rico in december  in the dominican republic in october and in the us virgin islands in june below are some key statistics regarding our caribbean wireless business approximately  wireless subscribers at the end of fiscal  of which were postpaid  revenue of million for fiscal  an increase of from fiscal  operating income of million for fiscal  as compared to an operating loss of million for fiscal  adjusted operating income of million for fiscal  an increase of from fiscal  representing adjusted operating income margins of and for fiscal and  respectively  capital expenditures of million for fiscal  a decrease of from fiscal  wireless arpu of for fiscal and for fiscal  and postpaid churn of and for fiscal and  respectively  and of for the three months ended may   down from for the same period in we provide wireless services in puerto rico pursuant to a mhz license in the mhz frequency band which also covers the us virgin islands 
our wireless network is supported by our high capacity terrestrial and undersea fiber optic network  which decreases our marginal network costs 
in fiscal  for example  our puerto rico wireless operating expenses per minute were lower than our us wireless operations  and our puerto rico wireless network capital expenditures for each incremental minute of use were lower than those of our us wireless operations 
in the dominican republic  we own of all america cables and radio  inc  our dominican republic subsidiary which operates under the name centennial dominicana and holds a mhz license at the mhz frequency band 
our dominican republic operations are experiencing significant growth  and  while adjusted operating income for fiscal was negative  it was positive in the fourth quarter of fiscal caribbean broadband 
our caribbean broadband business includes wireline operations in puerto rico and the dominican republic and cable television operations in puerto rico 
we launched broadband services in puerto rico in august and in the dominican republic in april  and we acquired cable television operations in puerto rico in september below are some key statistics and other information regarding our caribbean broadband business switched and dedicated access line equivalents of  at the end of fiscal  approximately  cable subscribers at end of fiscal  revenue of million for fiscal  an increase of from fiscal  operating loss of million for fiscal  as compared to an operating loss of million for fiscal  adjusted operating income of million for fiscal  an increase of from fiscal  representing adjusted operating income margins of and for fiscal and  respectively  capital expenditures of million for fiscal  a decrease of from fiscal  and a client base of multinational corporations  including cisco systems  inc  ibm corporation  lucent technologies inc  microsoft corporation  the procter gamble company and most of puerto rico s wireless carriers 

table of contents in puerto rico  we have built a fully integrated communications company since our launch in and are the only significant fiber based competitive local exchange carrier  or clec  on the island 
we provide a full range of services  including switched voice  private line services  international long distance  data  cable television  toll free and internet related services  to business and residential customers over our own fiber optic  coaxial and microwave network 
our digital cable television system serves southern and western puerto rico 
this digital cable system allows us to bring last mile broadband services to these less densely populated areas of puerto rico and enables us to bundle high speed data services with video  which we believe is an important factor in attracting and retaining customers 
in the dominican republic  we have constructed a terrestrial fiber optic network in santo domingo  the country s capital  and offer broadband services there 
currently  the majority of our broadband revenue in the dominican republic is derived from terminating the long distance traffic of other carriers originating in the united states 
to complement our terrestrial fiber networks  we own significant undersea fiber optic capacity connecting key markets in the caribbean with our international gateway switch in miami  florida 
this extensive fiber network allows us to offer customers with operations in our caribbean service area low cost  high quality  end to end broadband solutions 
for example  we provide america online  inc with telecommunications services to enable it to bring its internet services to puerto rico 
competitive strengths significant and improving cash flow 
our us wireless networks have been upgraded for digital tdma technology and our gsm network build out is in progress and expected to be substantially completed by the end of the build out of our caribbean wireless  fiber optic and cable television networks is substantially complete 
a decline in capital expenditures and a increase in adjusted operating income from fiscal to have resulted in improved cash flow 
competitive advantage through our owned fiber optic network in the caribbean 
our extensive terrestrial fiber optic network supports all of our services in the caribbean and  along with the purchased capacity we have on undersea fiber optic cables  allows us to offer our customers a single vendor solution for broadband connectivity to the united states 
our broadband and wireless businesses share other infrastructure  including switching equipment  and back office functions  which we believe enables us to transmit traffic more cheaply than our competitors 
we maximize this advantage by serving intensive users of telecommunication services 
extensive direct distribution 
over of our wireless sales in the united states and caribbean and substantially all of our broadband and cable television sales are made through our employees 
we believe this extensive company owned distribution network  consisting of stores and kiosks and  sales associates as of may   enables us to provide a superior sales and customer service experience to our customers 
we believe our competitors rely more heavily on higher cost  indirect distribution channels 
high quality network 
we believe that the quality and coverage of our network contributes to our high customer retention 
our monthly postpaid customer retention rate was for our us wireless operations for fiscal  which we believe is among the highest in the industry 
further  we are overlaying our network with gsm technology  which is the most commonly used global standard and is employed by our largest roaming partners 
the primary benefits of gsm gprs technology are better network capabilities and a superior selection of handsets in terms of price  functions and style 
market opportunity in the caribbean 
we believe that puerto rico and the dominican republic are large  politically stable markets with lower penetration rates and lower teledensity rates than the united states for both wireless and broadband telecommunications services and present an attractive market opportunity for us 
geographic focus 
we believe that we are able to give our geographic markets more focused attention than the national and multinational telecommunications operators with whom we compete 
generally  our markets are not large enough to be of critical importance to national and global competitors  which we believe 
table of contents permits us to provide superior customer service and tailored service offerings to these specific regions and customers 
strong management team and equity investors 
we have assembled our management team from several of the world s leading telecommunications operators  including alltel corporation communications co  bell atlantic corporation now verizon communications inc  sbc communications inc  bellsouth corporation and millicom international cellular sa welsh  carson  anderson stowe  or welsh carson  and the blackstone group  leading private equity investors  are controlling stockholders of centennial 
business strategy target high quality wireless customers 
we target high usage wireless customers in our caribbean service area by offering service plans with a significant number of minutes in exchange for a higher monthly fee 
we grew our postpaid customer base in our caribbean service area by in fiscal the arpu for our caribbean postpaid wireless customers was for fiscal  and bad debt expense for our caribbean operations was of service revenue for fiscal we believe we are able to generate high customer revenue because we provide superior customer service and we are able to offer rate plans with a large number of minutes 
increase penetration of our broadband business 
we are the only significant facilities based competitor to the puerto rico telephone company  or prtc  the incumbent wireline carrier in puerto rico 
we have laid approximately  miles of fiber optic cable in puerto rico that reaches approximately  buildings 
we believe that our ability to extend this extensive owned fiber optic network directly to the customer premises enables us to quickly meet customer demands for high bandwidth services 
we believe this network  coupled with our competitive prices  allows us to capture a large share of new  high capacity landline services in puerto rico 
we intend to continue to leverage this network to increase our market share 
we currently serve some of the largest enterprises  carriers and governmental institutions in puerto rico  including cisco  ibm  lucent  microsoft  proctor gamble and the university of puerto rico 
deploy gsm gprs in our us wireless network 
we have begun to overlay our midwest cluster network with gsm technology that will support gprs advanced data technology and expect to launch gsm service in our midwest cluster by the end of we intend to begin the overlay of our southeast cluster network with gsm technology after we complete our overlay in our midwest cluster  and we expect to launch gsm service in the southeast cluster in gsm gprs provides faster data services and makes available lower cost  more attractive  multi functional handsets  such as camera phones 
further  it aligns us technologically with our principal roaming partners 
we expect this deployment will improve our service offerings and will be important in attracting and retaining customers for our us wireless operations 
continue to build brand 
brand development is essential in the increasingly competitive telecommunications environments 
our brand emphasizes a superior customer experience by providing a quality network and effective customer service 
as a regional telecommunications provider  we tailor our brand to the three markets we serve trusted advisor in the united states  en confianza in puerto rico and centennial te escucha in the dominican republic 
we believe the success of our brand building efforts during fiscal was demonstrated by our lowest ever level of postpaid churn   in the fourth quarter

the nature of the products and services we offer varies depending on the market 
our principal source of revenue is derived from providing network access and airtime minutes of use to wireless telephone subscribers 
we offer primarily postpaid and  to a lesser extent  prepaid wireless services 
other value added services available to wireless telephone subscribers are similar to those provided by conventional landline telephone systems  including custom calling features such as voice mail  caller id  call forwarding  call waiting and conference calling 
in the united states  we also offer our customers short messaging services and access to information from the internet through their wireless phones 
in puerto rico  our recently upgraded next generation networks give our customers access to the wireless web directly from their handsets through our mobile web offering 
we offer our wireless customers a variety of handsets employing tdma technology in the united states and cdma technology in the caribbean 
we offer for sale a variety of handsets and accessories incorporating the latest in digital technology that is supportable on our network and a variety of rate plans designed to meet the varied needs of our customers 
most rate plans consist of a fixed monthly charge with varying allotments of included minutes  plus variable charges for additional minutes of use 
these handsets allow  among other things  our customers to roam onto other carriers digital or analog networks 
we offer handsets primarily from nokia  kyocera  motorola  panasonic and samsung 
broadband 
in our puerto rico and dominican republic service areas  we offer a broad range of communications services including atm asynchronous transfer mode  frame relay  dedicated access  dedicated internet ports  international long distance  switched access  high speed internet access  dial up internet access and private line services 
we also offer cable television services in our puerto rico service area 
all services are provided over our own fiber optic  coaxial and microwave network 
we also offer customers web page design  development  hosting and web casting  integration services and a variety of e commerce design and related services 
roaming in the united states  a significant portion of our revenue is generated from roaming 
we have negotiated agreements with our roaming partners that allow both companies customers to make and receive calls outside of their home calling areas 
during the last several years  we significantly lowered the prices for our roaming partners to discourage them from building networks in our service areas and moving roaming minutes off our network 
as part of these agreements  we significantly reduced our incollect costs the costs we pay other carriers when our subscribers are roaming on their networks 
our roaming revenue in fiscal was million  or approximately of our total consolidated revenue 
we expect roaming revenue in fiscal to be significantly less than in fiscal due to fewer minutes from roaming partners with cdma networks and reduced rates for partners with tdma gsm networks 
we 
table of contents have entered into long term roaming contracts with at t wireless and cingular for analog  tdma and gsm roaming 
these long term contracts provide us with greater predictability for roaming revenue and provide us with attractive incollect costs to enable us to offer national rate plans and enhance our competitive position 
in connection with the at t wireless roaming agreement  at t wireless granted us two separate options to purchase mhz of spectrum covering an aggregate of approximately million net pops in michigan and indiana 
the aggregate exercise price of the options is million  but the options may be exercised on a partial basis for less than all of the million net pops 
the options expire in late and early we are still evaluating this business opportunity  which would require us to incur additional capital expenditures if we elect to build out the network in these areas 
sales and marketing in the united states we market our services and products under the name centennial wireless 
in puerto rico  we market our wireless services and products under the name centennial de puerto rico  and in the dominican republic  we market our services and products under the name centennial dominicana 
nearly two years ago  we introduced a branding campaign named trusted advisor in the united states  and in the past year we introduced branding campaigns named en confianza in puerto rico and centennial te escucha in the dominican republic which are designed to convey our strategy based on delivering superior service 
our marketing objective is to increase our customer base  increase usage and reduce subscriber cancellations 
our current marketing strategy emphasizes continued net subscriber growth and targets customers who are likely to generate higher monthly revenue and low churn rates 
in marketing our services  we stress our superior sales and customer service  our quality wireless service  competitive prices  technologically advanced features and the local presence of our sales and customer service representatives and technical staff 
in the caribbean  we focus on marketing our services to postpaid customers 
in the united states  we focus on customers who live and work in our licensed serving areas  which keeps a significant portion of the minutes of use on our own network 
we also offer nationwide calling plans for customers who are attracted to one flat wireless rate 
the nationwide calling area offered in the united states includes our licensed area plus the roaming areas of at t wireless  cingular  verizon and alltel 
the long term roaming contracts we entered into with at t wireless and cingular enable our us wireless operation to offer nationwide rate plans at competitive rates 
as of may   we operated stores and kiosks in the united states  including a kiosk program in shopping malls and larger retail centers  and stores and kiosks in the caribbean  including company owned stores and kiosks in retail centers 
in puerto rico and the us virgin islands  we have a store or kiosk presence in most major shopping centers 
we use a variety of television  billboard  radio and newspaper advertising to stimulate interest in our services  increase our customer base  increase usage and reduce subscriber cancellations 
in both our us and caribbean wireless operations  we use both our own internal sales force and  to a lesser extent  independent agents and dealers to obtain customers for our services 
we believe we rely less on outside agents and dealers than larger  nationwide or global carriers 
as of may   we had an internal sales force of  these employees are generally paid a base pay plus commissions 
sales commissions are structured to take into account the rate plan selected and the length of the subscriber s contract and the type of wireless telephone sold 
we also maintain an ongoing training program to improve the effectiveness of our internal sales force 
our dealers are independent contractors paid solely on a commission basis 
customer service we are committed to assuring consistently high quality customer service 
both our us and caribbean wireless operations have a local staff  including a manager  customer service representatives and technical engineering staff 
we have established local customer support facilities for all of the us wireless telephone systems and the caribbean integrated communication system 
we believe that by having local offices and customer support facilities  we are better able to service customers and monitor the technical quality of our 
table of contents telecommunications services 
in the united states we have a centralized customer service center located in fort wayne  indiana 
in our caribbean service area  we have centralized customer service centers located in san juan  puerto rico  and santo domingo  dominican republic  as well as customer service support located in our retail stores 
system construction  operation and development wireless telephone technology is based upon the radio coverage of a given geographic area by a number of overlapping cells 
each cell contains a transmitter receiver at a base station or cell site that communicates by radio signal with wireless telephones located in the cell and is connected to a mobile telephone switching office  or the switch  which is connected to the local landline telephone network 
because wireless telephone systems are fully interconnected with the landline telephone network and long distance networks  subscribers can receive and originate both local and long distance calls from their wireless telephones 
if a wireless telephone user leaves the service area of the wireless telephone system during a call  the call is generally continued and carried through a technical interface established with an adjacent system through intersystem networking arrangements 
such an arrangement is referred to as roaming 
construction of wireless telephone systems is capital intensive  requiring a substantial investment for land and improvements  buildings  towers  switches  cell site equipment  microwave equipment  engineering and installation 
until technological limitations on maximum capacity are approached  additional wireless telephone system capacity can normally be added in increments that closely match demand after the initial construction phase is complete 
we use cdma technology in our caribbean wireless markets 
during fiscal  we constructed cell sites in our us wireless operations  and  as of may   our us wireless operations had cell sites 
during fiscal  we added cell sites in our caribbean wireless operations  and  as of may   our caribbean wireless operations had cell sites 
we expect continued network investment to support customer growth  increased usage per customer and new services 
in accordance with our strategy of developing market clusters  we have selected wireless switching systems that are capable of serving multiple markets with a single switch 
where we have deemed it appropriate  we have implemented microwave links and fiber connections in our us wireless telephone systems and caribbean integrated communication system  which provide ongoing cost efficiency and generally improve system reliability 
our us wireless systems are served by five technologically advanced nortel networks supernode switches in fort wayne  indiana  alexandria  louisiana  vidor  texas  and lafayette  louisiana 
for our us wireless operations  we intend to deploy a gsm network over our existing tdma network and to offer gprs advanced data technology 
this technology will maintain technological compatibility with our largest roaming partners and provide the speed and capacity to support a variety of innovative mobile data applications  including e mail  e commerce and web browsing 
in may  we entered into a multi year contract with ericsson  inc  to overlay our us wireless networks with gsm gprs technology 
gsm gprs technology provides faster data services and makes available lower cost  more attractive multi functional handsets  such as camera phones 
the new gsm gprs technology will provide us with the foundation for continued evolution of products and services through the future development of next generation products 
our puerto rico network uses cdma technology 
the latest generation of this technology is capable of carrying voice and data traffic at speeds significantly higher than the previous wireless technology and faster than dial up landline internet connections 
the construction of our caribbean integrated communication system is capital intensive 
in addition  the plans of our clec business to extend our fiber optic network and to enter into large commercial and residential buildings and industrial parks will necessitate further capital expenditures 
we have three switches in puerto rico 
in our caribbean service area  we use network equipment manufactured by lucent technologies 
in june  we entered into an agreement with nortel pursuant to which nortel will supply our dominican republic wireless operations with a cdma third generation network 

table of contents in  our cable network in puerto rico underwent digitization of its primary headend and transport equipment and offers its customers digital service 
high speed data service is being deployed and is currently available 
billing and operational support systems we operate management information systems to handle customer care  billing  network management  financial and administrative services 
we have outsourced with alltel information systems  a network management and operations support systems provider  to provide billing services to facilitate network fault detection  correction and management  performance and usage monitoring and security for our wireless operations throughout our company 
we maintain stringent controls for both voluntary and involuntary deactivations 
we attempt to minimize subscriber disconnects by identifying needed activation and termination policy adjustments through pre activation screening  credit review and call pattern profiling in order to detect any prior fraudulent or bad debt activity 
in our caribbean service area  we completed the implementation of our broadband billing and customer service systems in february we are continuing to invest in operations support systems  further enhancing our provisioning and billing of broadband services 
our cable television systems in puerto rico use csg systems for billing and customer service needs 
we are currently in the process of improving our cable television operational support systems to facilitate the rollout of new products and services 
competition wireless 
in the united states and puerto rico  the fcc can grant commercial mobile radio service  or cmrs  licenses to up to eight companies to provide different types of wireless telephone services in each of our service areas 
the fcc licenses cellular systems in geographically defined market areas  which comprised msas and rsas 
in each market  cellular frequencies are divided into two equal mhz blocks  which are designated as non wireline block a and wireline block b 
the fcc also grants two mhz licenses to operate broadband personal communication systems  or pcs  in each of defined major trading areas  or mtas  and one mhz and three mhz licenses in each of basic trading areas  or btas  which are component parts of mtas 
however  the fcc also allows cmrs carriers to subdivide and assign their spectrum allocations and or their geographic market areas to other carriers 
this creates the possibility of more than eight cmrs carriers having the ability to serve a single market 
we currently control mhz cellular licenses in msas and rsas in the united states  one mhz broadband pcs license in the puerto rico mta which includes the us virgin islands and a mhz pcs license in the dominican republic  which is not subject to fcc regulation 
our wireless systems compete directly with both cellular and broadband pcs licensees in each market on the basis of  among others  quality  price  area served  network coverage  services offered and responsiveness of customer service 
the telecommunications industry is experiencing rapid technological change 
with the development of new technologies  products and services  competition for wireless subscribers has intensified 
in general  in each of our us wireless markets we have between four and five competitors 
pcs operators have continued to build out their networks in our service areas and we expect this trend to continue 
our primary competitors in our us wireless markets are alltel  at t wireless  us cellular  cingular  nextel  sprint pcs and sprint affiliates  t mobile and verizon wireless 
we also compete to a lesser extent with paging  dispatch services and resellers 
as wireless service is becoming a viable alternative to traditional landline phone service  we are increasingly competing directly with the traditional landline telephone companies for customers 
the puerto rico wireless market is highly competitive 
in puerto rico  we compete with five other wireless carriers at t wireless  cingular  movistar partially owned by telef nica de espana  sprint pcs and verizon wireless 
the telecommunications market in the dominican republic is also highly competitive 
we compete with three other wireless carriers compania dominicana de telefonos c 
por a  a subsidiary of verizon wireless 
table of contents that is doing business as codetel  france telecom  which does business under the name orange  and tricom  sa controlled by gfn corporation  ltd  one of the dominican republic s largest private holding companies  and motorola 
most of our competitors have greater financial resources than we do 
we expect competition for wireless subscribers in our markets to continue to remain intense 
in the future  we may also compete against emerging wireless technologies  including satellite based mobile voice and data services and g wireless technologies 
broadband 
our caribbean operations hold an authorization to provide broadband services in puerto rico  a concession to provide a variety of telecommunications services in the dominican republic and authorization to provide facilities based international long distance service in the united states 
our main competitor for our broadband services in puerto rico is the prtc  the incumbent telephone company and a subsidiary of verizon 
there are no other facilities based clecs with significant operations at this time  but we cannot be sure that other clecs will not emerge in puerto rico in the future 
in the dominican republic  we compete primarily against the incumbent provider codetel  which has a substantial market share  and tricom  which provides both wireline and fixed wireless service 
cable 
we are the only cable television operator in our franchise areas 
liberty media and adelphia communications also operate cable television companies in puerto rico  but not in our franchise areas 
our cable television company in puerto rico competes primarily against the direct broadcast satellite companies  namely directv and echostar 
regulation us federal regulation our operations in the united states  puerto rico  and the us virgin islands are governed by  among other regulations  the communications act of  or the communications act  which was substantially amended by the telecommunications act of  or the act 
the communications act has provisions dealing specifically with our wireless services and our cable television services  as well as provisions applicable to both our wireless and landline services 
matters specific to wireless carriers 
the cellular and pcs systems we operate  known as cmrs systems  are licensed and regulated by the fcc under the communications act 
the fcc regulates the licensing  construction  operation  acquisition and sale of cmrs systems 
prior fcc rules prohibited licensees from controlling more than mhz of licensed cmrs spectrum in any cmrs market 
under these rules  acquisitions of spectrum below this limitation were essentially always permitted and acquisitions of spectrum above this limitation were essentially always prohibited 
in early  this bright line spectrum limitation was replaced with a rule under which cmrs spectrum acquisitions are assessed on a case by case basis  without regard to whether they would have been permissible or impermissible under the old limitation 
this rule change potentially allows us to acquire additional spectrum in some areas  but also adds uncertainty to our ability to acquire spectrum in areas where  under the old rule  approval would have been essentially automatic 
we do not currently expect to need additional spectrum in any of our service areas 
the fcc generally issues cmrs licenses for a term of ten years  after which they must be renewed 
cmrs licenses may be revoked and license renewal applications denied by the fcc for cause 
under present rules  there may be competition for a cmrs license upon the expiration of its initial license term 
while there can be no assurance that any license will be renewed  the fcc s rules provide for a significant renewal preference to cellular and pcs licensees that have used their spectrum for its intended purpose  have built a network and have complied with fcc regulations and federal communication statutes 
if a cmrs licensee is awarded a renewal expectancy  its renewal will be granted without further consideration of any competing applications 
while our cellular licenses have been renewed regularly by the fcc in the past  and we believe 
table of contents that we have used our spectrum for its intended purpose and completely within applicable legislation and have built an extensive network  there can be no assurance that all of our licenses will be renewed in the future 
the fcc also regulates other aspects of the operation and ownership of cmrs systems 
operational regulations include the cellular rules requiring coordination of proposed frequency usage with adjacent cellular licensees to avoid electrical interference between adjacent systems 
in addition  the height and power of base station transmitting facilities and the type of signals they emit must fall within specified parameters 
in november  an fcc rule expired that had expressly prohibited cmrs carriers from placing restrictions on the resale of their services by parties who would buy blocks of numbers and services and resell them to end users 
however  we remain subject to provisions of the communications act requiring us to apply only just  reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms to our services  so it is unclear what effect  if any  the expiration of the fcc s rule will have on our operations 
the fcc also imposes radio frequency radiation limitation requirements on cmrs licensees 
there can be no assurance that any fcc requirements currently applicable to our cmrs system will not be changed in the future 
ownership regulations include the requirement to obtain prior fcc approval before completing most types of acquisitions and assignments of fcc licenses 
acquisitions of minority interests generally do not require fcc approval 
whenever fcc approval is required  any interested party may file a petition to dismiss or deny the application for approval of the proposed transfer or assignment 
in addition to regulation by the fcc  wireless systems are also subject to federal aviation administration  or faa  regulations regarding the siting and construction of wireless transmitter towers and antennas  as well as local zoning requirements 
the fcc also requires that all licensees register and obtain fcc registration numbers for all of their antennas and or towers that require prior faa clearance 
all new towers must be registered at the time of construction 
failure to properly register a tower could lead to enforcement action  such as the imposition of a penalty 
we believe that we are in compliance with the tower registration requirements 
matters relevant to both wireless and landline telephone operations 
amendments to the communications act made by the act were aimed at opening local telecommunications markets to competition 
the provisions of the communications act added by the act govern  among other things  the removal of barriers to market entry and impose on incumbent local exchange carriers  or ilecs  duties to negotiate reasonable and nondiscriminatory interconnection agreements and access to unbundled elements of the ilec s network at any technically feasible point 
the law encourages competition through these provisions and others governing resale  number portability  dialing parity  access to rights of way and numbering administration 
the overall effect of the amendments made by the act on our business continues to be unclear 
the fcc has issued numerous rules and regulations to implement the act and all significant fcc rulings have been appealed to the courts 
generally speaking  the fcc has prevailed in the courts  but in some cases it has not  and even when it eventually prevails  the ongoing litigation which has reached the united states supreme court in two cases creates uncertainty for companies such as us trying to comply with the legislation and associated fcc regulations 
we have  however  benefited from reduced costs in acquiring required communication services  such as ilec interconnection  and we have benefited from the right to receive compensation for the termination of traffic as discussed below 
however  provisions relating to interconnection  telephone number portability  equal access and resale could subject us to increased competition and additional economic and regulatory burdens 
reciprocal compensation refers to payments that one carrier makes when it sends traffic to another carrier for completion 
reciprocal compensation applies to calls between landline networks and between a landline and a cmrs network 
we both send and receive traffic to and from landline networks and so both pay and receive reciprocal compensation 
the treatment of compensation for calls to internet service providers  or isps  which affects us in puerto rico  has been particularly controversial 
the fcc has established rules generally intended to reduce and  possibly  eventually eliminate the compensation paid by one carrier to another for jointly handling isp bound calls 
this lower compensation  however  only applies where the incumbent telephone company also agrees to receive lower compensation for calls it receives whether bound 
table of contents for isps or not 
the courts have confirmed that these rules may remain in effect while the fcc continues its legal and regulatory analysis of the issue  which remains ongoing 
in july  we concluded arbitration of a new interconnection agreement with the prtc that generally reflects these new fcc rules 
see matters specific to our puerto rico operations 
centennial both sends traffic to  and receives traffic from  prtc  so the fcc s compensation rules apply to both centennial and prtc 
we continue to disagree with prtc about whether compensation is due under the fcc rules for certain types of isp bound calls and we expect this issue will remain in dispute for the foreseeable future 
as a result  it is unclear how and to what extent the implementation of the fcc rules will affect us 
state and local regulation 
under the communications act  no state may regulate the entry of cmrs providers or the rates charged for cmrs service 
however  states can regulate other terms and conditions of service 
the siting and construction of cmrs facilities  including transmission towers  antennas and equipment shelters  may be subject to state or local zoning  land use and other local regulations 
before a system can be put into commercial operation  the holder of a cmrs license must obtain all necessary zoning and building permit approvals for the transmitter sites and switching locations 
local jurisdictions control access to the rights of way and state governments often public utility commissions have the right to set rules relating to customer service 
for example  some states and several local communities have enacted ordinances restricting the use of wireless phones while driving a motor vehicle 
several other state and local legislative bodies have proposed legislation to adopt similar laws 
these laws could reduce subscriber usage and lead to potential litigation against wireless carriers 
service requirements 
the fcc has adopted requirements for cmrs providers to implement basic and enhanced services  or e e is being rolled out in phases 
e capabilities will enable cmrs systems to determine the location of persons making emergency calls 
the fcc s rules require cmrs carriers to work with local public safety officials to process the calls  including those made from analog mobile telephones that are not registered with the carrier s cellular system 
since april  cmrs carriers have been required to be able to identify the cell from which the call has been made as well as the identification of the calling party number 
the rules also require cmrs systems to continue to improve their ability to locate wireless callers within a cell 
fcc rules generally required that by october   nationwide cmrs carriers be able to provide location information with a greater degree of accuracy in accordance with standards set by the fcc 
for regional cmrs providers such as ourselves  the fcc extended the compliance deadline to march   or to a mutually acceptable date agreed to by the wireless provider and local governmental authorities responsible for services 
in some cases the local governmental authorities in our service areas have not yet asked us to meet these requirements  in other cases  we have negotiated or are in the process of negotiating mutually acceptable compliance dates 
we believe that we are materially in compliance with our e obligations 
the fcc has ruled that the costs associated with the various phases of e compliance are not reimbursable 
thus  these e rules require us to spend additional capital to implement the e requirements 
electronic surveillance standards 
the communications assistance for law enforcement act requires all telecommunications carriers  including us and other cmrs licensees  to implement equipment changes necessary to assist law enforcement authorities in achieving enhanced ability to conduct electronic surveillance of those suspected of criminal activity 
the fcc has established varying deadlines for different aspects of this legislation 
in august  the fcc added additional surveillance capability requirements  which carriers were required to meet by september  however  on august   a federal circuit court of appeals vacated and remanded some of these requirements 
the fcc then reexamined and reissued these requirements  which are commonly referred to as the punchlist items  and extended the september  punchlist compliance deadline to june  due to centennial s network upgrade schedule  centennial did not meet some of the compliance deadlines 
however  centennial currently has waivers on file with the fcc requesting an extension of the applicable compliance deadlines 
issues relating to when and how carriers may obtain reimbursement from the federal government for equipment upgrades associated with such requirements are still unresolved 

table of contents universal service 
our us wireless and puerto rico wireless and wireline operations are required to contribute to the federal universal service fund and to any equivalent state fund 
in general  these funds are created to subsidize telecommunications services in rural and high cost areas of the united states 
centennial is currently receiving federal universal service non rural high cost support for its operations in puerto rico 
in addition  we have recently filed applications in louisiana  mississippi  indiana and michigan to receive support in these states as well 
under the fcc s current regulations and nationwide benchmark costing model  puerto rico was found to be below the national benchmark for receiving high cost support 
as a consequence  the federal funds available to puerto rico will be reduced gradually over the next several years 
under the current scheme  support for puerto rico would be completely phased out by however  support is distributed by wire center and thus support for lower cost wire centers in puerto rico could be phased out prior to the fcc proceeding to review these issues is currently pending after remand from the courts 
thus  centennial s future ability to receive universal service support is unclear 
in addition  the fcc is conducting a review of its rules applicable to the amount of funding available to competitive carriers providing services supported by the high cost funding system 
it is impossible to predict the outcome of this fcc review  which may result in centennial receiving materially less universal service support than it does today 
rate integration 
rate integration is the averaging of interstate long distance rates throughout a provider s customer base 
the fcc is currently examining the applicability of current rate integration requirements on cmrs offerings  particularly to wide area calling plans 
until this process is concluded it will be uncertain what obligations  if any  cmrs providers will have in this regard 
however  implementation of rate integration requirements could have an effect on our current service offerings and rate plans and hinder our pricing flexibility  making it harder for us to compete in our markets 
number pooling 
the telecommunications industry has been faced with an apparent shortage of available telephone numbers  arising from many different factors within the industry 
as a consequence  the fcc and state regulators have become concerned with promoting the efficient use of the available numbers 
the fcc has imposed what is referred to as thousand block pooling 
beginning november   carriers may only request and will only be assigned numbers in blocks of one thousand numbers rather than the previous blocks of ten thousand numbers 
to request additional blocks  carriers must meet utilization thresholds set by the fcc 
this more restrictive pooling requirement will force carriers to more closely track their number utilization  imposing greater administrative burdens and increased pressure to implement number portability  which may require possible equipment upgrades 
number portability 
number portability allows a cmrs carrier s customer who moves to another carrier to take along  or port  his or her phone number 
the original cmrs carrier must be able to transmit calls to the ported number 
until july   cmrs carriers were required to provide number portability by november  on july   the fcc voted to extend this deadline to november  a legal challenge seeking to extend that deadline further was rejected by the courts in june as a result  wireless carriers who provide services in any of markets specifically designated by the fcc must provide for wireless number portability in these markets by november  and in all other markets by may puerto rico and fort wayne  indiana are included in these designated markets and constitute of our net pops 
the implementation of number portability will increase competition and require equipment and network upgrades 
these upgrades will require expenditures of additional capital with no immediate new sources of revenue 
we cannot predict the impact of these anticipated capital expenditures on our operations 
hearing aid compatibility 
in july  the fcc modified its rules that exempt wireless phones from the requirements of the hearing aid compatibility act and created new rules that impose obligations on wireless carriers and handset manufacturers to make available handsets that meet certain requirements that allow hearing aid users to have access to digital wireless services 
the new rules require that within two years handset manufacturers and wireless carriers make available two wireless phone models that have the required air interface standard for radio frequency interference 
within three years  two wireless phone models must be available that meet the t coil compatibility standard  and by all phones must meet the radio frequency interference standard 
all of these requirements impose obligations that will require wireless providers like us to invest in handsets that meet the required criteria and as such may increase the cost of the wireless phones we offer our customers 

table of contents matters specific to our puerto rico operations 
comprehensive telecommunications reform legislation was enacted in by the commonwealth of puerto rico 
this legislation  titled the puerto rico telecommunications act of  or the puerto rico act  is intended to open the puerto rico telecommunications market to competition 
among other things  it established the telecommunications regulatory board of puerto rico  or trb  which was given primary regulatory jurisdiction in puerto rico over all telecommunications services  all service providers  and all persons with a direct or indirect interest in said services or providers 
increased competition in puerto rico has put pressure on our operation to become more aggressive in pricing plans and product offerings  which in turn has added to our interconnection requirements 
in july  we concluded the arbitration of a new interconnection agreement with prtc 
the agreement was formally affirmed by the trb  in december the new agreement reflects our view that our local calling areas should determine whether a landline call between us and prtc is rated as local or toll for purposes of intercarrier compensation 
as our local calling areas are larger  fewer calls will cross local calling area boundaries  thereby lowering our costs by reducing the amount of access charges we might owe to prtc 
in addition  the agreement affirms our right to use our extensive physical interconnections with prtc s network to provide direct connections to business customers seeking to shift some or all of their business to us 
however  the agreement contains prtc proposed traffic classifications that prtc will argue relieve it of its obligation to compensate us for some isp bound calls  and which may result in an obligation on our part to pay prtc relatively high access charges on some calls on which we believe we should pay lower reciprocal compensation rates 
in january  prtc filed an appeal of the trb s ruling in federal court in puerto rico  challenging the trb s decision to use our calling areas to classify traffic 
in our response  we challenged the trb s decision to use prtc s traffic classifications in the way just noted above 
the matter is now pending before the court 
there can be no assurance that we will prevail on our challenge to the trb s decision  nor that prtc s challenge to the trb s decision to rely on our calling areas will be rejected 
in addition  several long distance providers in puerto rico have requested that we provide equal access for our wireline customers 
equal access would allow customers to reach their long distance providers by dialing one plus the number 
we implemented equal access in puerto rico during fiscal the implementation of equal access could have an impact on our long distance business by increasing competition 
dominican republic the telecommunications regulatory framework in the dominican republic consists of general telecommunications law no 
 enacted on may   resolutions promulgated under that law  the dominican republic s reference document filed with the world trade organization and concession agreements entered into by the dominican government with individual service providers 
none of the outstanding concession agreements contains an exclusive arrangement with any wireless carrier and the dominican government has announced a policy of encouraging growth through competition in the telecommunications industry 
in addition  the law created a governing body to regulate telecommunication activities 
this body is referred to as the dominican institute of telecommunications  or indotel 
indotel is headed by a five member council  which includes a representative from the telecommunications industry 
indotel has control over all frequency bands and channels of radio transmission and communications within the country and over its jurisdictional water 
we believe that this modern legislation  combined with technological advances and the sustained growth of private investment  will significantly contribute to the development of the telecommunications sector in the dominican republic 
to substantially broaden the number of its citizens with access to a telephone and to allow for the establishment and growth of other modern telecommunications services  the dominican government adopted a policy of liberalization of the telecommunications sector beginning in the late s 
in  the dominican government enacted a series of interconnection resolutions that required all service providers in the dominican republic to contractually interconnect with all other service providers  under guidelines articulated 
table of contents in the resolutions 
this telecommunication law establishes a basic framework to regulate the installation  maintenance and operation of telecommunication networks and the provision of telecommunications services and equipment in the country 
the law ratifies the universal service principle  by guaranteeing the access of telecommunications services at affordable prices in low income rural and urban areas  to be achieved through market conditions and through the development of the telecommunications sector 
it creates a fund for the development of the telecommunications sector that will be supported by a levy on industry participants of of all telecommunication service billings 
as a result of the new interconnection rate structure  the rate for the termination of international inbound calls to the dominican republic has increased 
this increase required the renegotiation of termination agreements with several international exchange carriers 
centennial is currently in the process of negotiating these agreements 
centennial has renegotiated the majority of these interconnection agreements to reflect the new rate structure  however  certain agreements are still under negotiation because some companies are refusing to accept the new interconnection rates 
it is difficult to assess at this time the ultimate impact of the increase in these rates  however  the increased rates for the termination of international traffic in the dominican republic could have an adverse effect on the volume of traffic terminated by centennial which may or may not be offset by the increased revenue 
on april   we negotiated new interconnection agreements with all dominican carriers  in compliance with the interconnection regulation enacted by indotel in june these agreements were approved and ratified by indotel s executive council 
we believe the new interconnection agreements establish a fair and non discriminatory set of terms and will lower the average cost of terminating a domestic call within the dominican republic 
the dominican government made changes to the tax regime governing telecommunications carriers 
effective on january   telecommunication providers adopted the system established by the dominican republic s tax code 
since  all telecommunications companies have been operating under the canon tax  which imposes a tax on the difference between our revenue and our interconnection costs 
now telecommunications providers will be relieved of the obligation to pay this tax and pay on taxable profits with a minimum tax of on gross revenue to expire on december  notwithstanding the above  a new fiscal package was introduced in late to the national congress that calls for an extension in the application of the minimum tax of until december  in exchange  the minimum percentage will be lowered from to 
the senate preliminarily approved the bill on may  pending a second vote 
later on  the bill is to be discussed and voted by the chamber of deputies 
we operate in the dominican republic under a concession that previously belonged to international telephone telegraph  or itt  and dating back over years 
after several modifications  the concession s latest version dates to  when a new twenty year term was awarded to our subsidiary  centennial dominicana 
the concession contract also provides that centennial dominicana may construct  operate and exploit all types of telecommunications services in the dominican republic 
in august  the dominican government  by presidential decree  introduced a tax on all exports of goods and services  which includes the services that we provide to international telecommunications providers 
the constitutionality of the tax is currently being challenged in the dominican supreme court  in part  on the basis that the tax was enacted solely by presidential declaration  rather than by the legislature 
in addition  we believe that the services that we provide to international telecommunications providers should not be considered taxable as an export under this new law 
us virgin islands our fcc license for puerto rico covers the us virgin islands 
as stated above  the us virgin islands are part of the united states  so our operations there are subject to the communications act and the act  and  for purposes of regulating our operations  the government of the us virgin islands is the equivalent of a state 

table of contents cable television regulation our cable television operation in puerto rico is subject to both federal and local regulation 
we are subject to federal statutory provisions governing cable television contained in the communications act of  as amended  and associated fcc regulations 
those regulations cover our obligations with regard to signal carriage requirements  leased access to channels  political advertising  signal leakage and a number of other matters that affect our operations including access to poles  conduits and rights of way controlled by municipalities and utilities 
locally  we are regulated by the trb 
in order to provide cable services  an operator must obtain a franchise that gives the operator access to the rights of way 
a franchise is an agreement whereby the franchising authority the trb allows the cable provider centennial access to the right of ways for the installation of its cable network 
in exchange  we agree to conditions that vary from franchise to franchise given that franchise agreements are subject to negotiation 
in puerto rico  the trb is responsible for franchising cable television operators 
we hold six franchises in puerto rico covering the southern and western parts of the island 
franchises are effective for a defined term  which vary among franchises 
our six franchises expire between and upon expiration  franchises may be renewed 
franchise renewals are subject to negotiation between the franchising authority and the provider 
whether a renewal is granted depends on various factors including  among other things  our financial standing  the quality of the service provided and whether we complied with our obligations under the franchise agreement 
the trb may also seek to impose additional terms and conditions  such as build out and upgrade requirements 
the local franchising authority in puerto rico  the trb  may also have the right to regulate rates when a provider is not subject to effective competition 
a provider is assumed not to be subject to effective competition unless there has been a finding by the fcc to the contrary 
our markets have been found by the fcc to be subject to effective competition 
as such  our rates are not subject to rate regulation 
employees we had approximately  employees as of may  our employees are not represented by a labor organization 
we consider our relationship with our employees to be good 
risk factors investors in our securities should carefully consider the risks described below and other information included in this report 
our business  financial condition  or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks  and the trading price of our securities could decline due to any of these risks 
investors in our securities could lose all or part of their investment as a result of any such decline 
this report also contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  please see cautionary statement for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including the risks faced by us described below 
risks relating to our business we operate in a very competitive business environment  which may result in the loss of existing customers and our inability to attract new customers 
our principal business  wireless telephone service  is highly competitive 
in the united states  we compete against an average of four or five other wireless carriers in the markets we serve 
in puerto rico  we compete against five other wireless carriers and in the dominican republic we compete against three other wireless carriers 
many of our existing competitors are larger than we are  have greater financial resources than we do and are less leveraged than we are 
competition for customers is based principally upon services and features offered  system coverage  technical quality of the wireless system  price  customer service and network capacity 
some competitors may market services we do not offer  which may make their services more attractive to customers 
we expect competition to intensify as a result of the development of new technologies  
table of contents products and services and as the rate of subscriber growth for the industry continues to slow 
with so many companies targeting many of the same customers  we may not be able to successfully attract and retain customers and grow our customer base and revenue 
market prices for wireless services may continue to decline in the future 
market prices for wireless voice and data services have declined over the last several years and may continue to decline in the future due to increased competition 
we cannot make assurances that we will be able to maintain or improve arpu 
we expect significant competition among wireless providers to continue to drive service and equipment prices lower 
this may lead to increasing movement of customers between competitors and consequently to churn 
additionally  over the last several years  rates for terminating traffic to the dominican republic have decreased 
if market prices continue to decline it could adversely affect our ability to grow revenue  which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and our ability to service our indebtedness 
roaming revenue represented of our us wireless revenue for fiscal  and roaming revenue is likely to decline in the future 
we earn a portion of our revenue from customers of other wireless communications providers who enter our service areas and use their wireless phones  commonly referred to as roaming 
roaming rates per minute have declined over the last several years and we expect that such declines will continue for the foreseeable future 
for fiscal  we recorded million of roaming revenue 
for fiscal  we recorded million of roaming revenue  which represented of us wireless revenue 
we expect roaming revenue in fiscal to be significantly less than in fiscal due to fewer minutes from roaming partners with cdma networks and reduced rates for partners with tdma gsm networks 
we expect roaming revenue to continue to decline in the future 
our failure to complete the build out of our gsm gprs network  or a delay in the build out and launch  could have a material adverse effect on our us wireless operations and roaming revenue  in particular 
two of our major roaming partners are performing a gsm overlay of their existing tdma networks and  in connection with roaming arrangements we have entered into with them  have required that we overlay our existing network in our midwest cluster with gsm technology 
we are contractually obligated to complete a portion of the overlay in our midwest cluster by the end of we intend to begin the overlay in our southeast cluster as soon as we complete the overlay in our midwest cluster  and we expect to launch gsm service in the southeast cluster during if we fail to complete the build out in a manner and timeframe consistent with our contractual arrangements with our roaming partners  we may experience a significant loss of roaming revenue from those partners 
in addition  if we fail to meet certain contractual build out requirements  the options from at t wireless to purchase additional spectrum in our midwest cluster could terminate 
in addition  we believe that customers are increasingly demanding the most technologically advanced wireless devices 
the tdma supported phones that we currently offer lack many of the innovative features currently offered by our cdma and gsm gprs competitors  such as color screens and cameras 
therefore  if we fail to launch gsm service in our us wireless operations in the near future  we believe we may lose subscribers and our retail business may be adversely affected 
if we are unable to effectively manage subscriber cancellations  our revenue and net growth in subscribers may be adversely affected 
the wireless industry is extremely competitive 
among other things  the wireless industry is characterized by a high rate of churn 
churn can be the result of several competitive factors  including price  service offerings  network coverage  reliability issues and customer care concerns 
efforts to reduce churn increase costs as we offer incentives to customers to remain users of our wireless services  and efforts to replace lost 
table of contents subscribers increases our customer acquisition costs 
as a result  churn may reduce our revenue and increase our costs 
wireless number portability may increase churn and increase our marketing costs 
the fcc has mandated that wireless carriers provide for wireless number portability in designated markets by november  and in all other markets by may our puerto rico and fort wayne  indiana  markets  which encompass of our net pops  are included in the fcc s designated markets 
wireless number portability will allow customers to keep their wireless phone number when switching between service providers 
number portability will make it more convenient for customers to change wireless service providers and therefore could cause churn to increase significantly 
we anticipate wireless number portability will increase price competition 
we may be required to grant promotional credits  subsidize product upgrades  and or reduce pricing to match competitors initiatives in an effort to retain customers  which could adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  the implementation of number portability will require equipment and network upgrades which may cause service disruptions 
these upgrades will require expenditures of additional capital 
we cannot predict the effect of these anticipated capital expenditures on our operations 
regulatory changes may impose restrictions that adversely affect us or cause us to incur significant unplanned costs in modifying our business plans or operations 
the us telecommunications industry is subject to federal  state and other regulations that are continually evolving 
in addition  the telecommunications industry in the dominican republic is similarly subject to change 
as new telecommunication laws and regulations are issued  we may be required to modify our business plans or operations 
we cannot make assurances that we can do so in a cost effective manner 
in addition  the failure by us to comply with applicable governmental regulations could result in the loss of our licenses or the assessment of penalties or fines or otherwise have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations 
for a more detailed description of the regulatory framework we operate in  see regulation in this item the fcc  which has jurisdiction over our operations in the united states  puerto rico and the us virgin islands  and state regulatory agencies continue to issue rules implementing the requirements of the telecommunications act of  or the act 
these rules include the obligation of incumbent telephone companies to allow other carriers to connect to their network by reasonable means at rates based on cost 
the interpretation and implementation of these and other provisions of the act and the fcc rules implementing the act continue to be heavily debated and may have a material adverse effect on our business 
centennial puerto rico is also subject to the jurisdiction of the trb 
the trb could determine that the rates for our wireline services are unreasonably high or otherwise not in the public interest 
the trb could also revoke our local exchange certification if we fail to comply with applicable regulations 
this determination could have a material adverse effect on our business 
see regulation us federal regulation matters specific to our puerto rico operations in this item we are subject to siting and zoning regulations that could materially affect our ability to build new cell sites and expand our coverage 
all telecommunication providers are obligated to contribute to the federal universal service fund in accordance with a formula presently based upon a percentage of interstate and intrastate revenue 
the contribution formula may change in ways that would materially adversely affect us 
universal service funds are used  among other things  to provide local telephone service to individuals or families qualifying for federal assistance or households in remote areas 
many states  including those we operate in  are implementing local universal service programs that would require carriers to contribute additional funds 
further  federal or state governments  the government of the commonwealth of puerto rico or the government of the dominican republic could adopt regulations or take other actions that might have a 
table of contents material adverse effect on our business 
these changes could materially and adversely affect our business prospects  operating results and ability to service our debt 
the loss of our licenses or cable franchises would adversely affect our ability to provide wireless and broadband services 
in the united states  cellular  personal communications services and microwave licenses are valid for ten years from the effective date of the license 
licensees may renew their licenses for additional ten year periods by filing renewal applications with the fcc 
the renewal applications are subject to fcc review and are put out for public comment to ensure that the licensees meet their licensing requirements and comply with other applicable fcc mandates 
failure to file for renewal of these licenses or failure to meet any licensing requirements could lead to a denial of the renewal application and thus adversely affect our ability to continue to provide service in that license area 
our cable franchises in puerto rico are subject to similar restrictions 
furthermore  our compliance with regulatory requirements such as enhanced and wireless local number portability may depend on the availability of necessary equipment and or software 
failure to comply with these regulatory requirements may have an adverse effect on our licenses and or operations and could result in sanctions  fines or other penalties 
our wireless licenses may decrease in value  reducing the asset base that supports our debt 
a substantial portion of our assets consists of intangible assets  principally our interests in wireless licenses held by our subsidiaries 
if the market value of our wireless licenses decreases significantly  we may realize a material loss upon the sale of any of our licenses and our ability to sell assets to repay debt would be significantly affected 
the market for the purchase and sale of wireless licenses may not exist in the future or the values of our licenses in that market may fall 
the future value of our interests in our wireless licenses will depend significantly upon the success of our business 
moreover  the transfer of interests in these licenses is prohibited without fcc approval 
we cannot make assurances that we would be able to obtain fcc approval to transfer interests in our licenses if such a transfer became necessary 
rapid and significant technological changes in the telecommunications industry may adversely affect us 
we face rapid and significant changes in technology 
in particular  the wireless telecommunications industry is experiencing significant technological change  including evolving industry standards  the allocation of new radio frequency spectrum in which to license and operate advanced wireless services  ongoing improvements in the capacity and quality of digital technology and shorter development cycles for new products and enhancements  changes in end user requirements and preferences  development of data and broadband capabilities  and migration to next generation services 
in order for us to keep up with these technological changes to remain competitive  we will be required to continue to make significant capital expenditures to build our integrated communication system 
in addition  the plans of our clec business to extend our fiber optic network and to enter into large commercial and residential buildings and industrial parks will necessitate further capital expenditures 
customer acceptance of the services that we offer will continually be affected by technology based differences in our product and service offerings 
for example  two way radio dispatch  or push to talk technology  which allows subscribers to talk to each other instantly with a single push of a button  is becoming increasingly popular as it allows subscribers to save time on dialing or making a connection to a network 
the most popular push to talk feature is offered by nextel  which competes with us in many of our us wireless 
table of contents markets 
other wireless providers are testing systems that would allow them to offer a form of push to talk technology to their subscribers 
we do not currently offer a push to talk product 
calls using this technology tend to be shorter and less expensive than traditional wireless telephone service 
as demand for this service continues to grow and if other wireless providers in our service areas succeed in implementing forms of push to talk technology  we may have difficulty attracting and retaining subscribers  which will have an adverse effect on our business 
we cannot predict the effect of technological changes on our business  as technological changes may result in increases in our capital expenditures 
new technologies may be protected by patents or other intellectual property laws and therefore may not be available to us 
it is possible that technological developments will have a material adverse effect on us 
like others in the industry  we are uncertain about the extent of customer demand despite improvements in technology as well as the extent to which airtime and monthly access rates may continue to decline 
also  alternative technologies may be developed that provide wireless communications service or alternative service superior to that available from us 
rapid changes in technology in our market may adversely affect our business 
we rely on a limited number of key suppliers and vendors for timely supply of equipment and services relating to our network infrastructure 
if these suppliers or vendors experience problems or favor our competitors  we could fail to obtain sufficient quantities of the products and services we require to operate our businesses successfully 
we depend on a limited number of suppliers and vendors for equipment and services relating to our network infrastructure 
if these suppliers experience interruptions or other problems delivering these network components on a timely basis  our subscriber growth and operating results could suffer significantly 
our initial choice of a network infrastructure supplier can  where proprietary technology of the supplier is an integral component of the network  cause us to be effectively locked into one or a few suppliers for key network components 
as a result  we have become reliant upon a limited number of network equipment manufacturers  including nortel networks corporation  lucent technologies  inc and ericsson  inc 
if it becomes necessary to seek alternative suppliers and vendors  we may be unable to obtain satisfactory replacement suppliers or vendors on economically attractive terms  on a timely basis  or at all 
if we lose our senior management  our business may be adversely affected 
the success of our business is largely dependent on our executive officers  as well as on our ability to attract and retain other highly qualified technical and management personnel 
we believe that there is  and will continue to be  intense competition for qualified personnel in the wireless services industry  and we cannot make assurances that we will be able to attract and retain the personnel necessary for the development of our business 
the loss of key personnel or the failure to attract additional personnel as required could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we do not currently maintain key person life insurance on any of our key employees 
business  political  regulatory and economic factors and severe weather may significantly affect our operations and hurt our overall performance 
our business is dependent on the business and economic conditions as well as consumer spending in the areas in which we operate  particularly in the caribbean 
if existing economic conditions in the caribbean were to deteriorate  the market for wireless or other communications services in the caribbean may be disproportionately and adversely affected due to the generally lower per capita income in the caribbean as compared to the united states 
this deterioration would also have an adverse effect on our business in the caribbean and  because our puerto rico operations contribute significantly to our financial performance  on our overall financial condition and results of operations 
our business may be materially adversely affected by events such as hurricanes  labor strikes  terrorism and other factors that may generally affect the regions in which we operate 
for instance  hurricanes and labor 
table of contents strikes significantly slow down the provisioning of services by third parties and needed repair of our network  which could adversely affect our ability to deliver telecommunications and cable services 
any change in puerto rico s political status with the united states  or the ongoing debate about such status  could affect the economy of puerto rico 
the ultimate effect of possible changes in puerto rico s governmental and political status is uncertain and  accordingly  we cannot make assurances that such changes will not materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 
in addition  the economy of the caribbean area is highly dependant on tourism 
if the tourism industry continues to decline  in particular as a result of the threat of terrorism  it could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the dominican republic s currency is the dr peso 
the dr peso has experienced approximately devaluation against the us dollar during fiscal we transact the majority of our business in the dominican republic in dr pesos  however  we purchase wireless phones and network infrastructure in us dollars  thereby exposing us to foreign currency exchange risk 
further devaluation of the dr peso could have a material adverse effect on our dominican republic operations profitability 
our operations in puerto rico may be adversely affected if changes in tax benefits available to businesses in puerto rico cause companies to reduce their business activities there 
the demand for our services in puerto rico is significantly affected by the level of business activity on the island 
puerto rico provides tax incentives for us companies to operate in puerto rico and to reinvest the earnings from their puerto rico operations in puerto rico 
as a result of a amendment to the us internal revenue code  the tax benefits available to corporations doing business in puerto rico phase out in annual increments through consequently  these corporations may reduce or close their puerto rico operations and may reduce or eliminate their re investments in puerto rico 
the changes may also reduce the incentives for new investments in puerto rico 
as a result  such changes in the tax law could reduce demand for our services 
our universal service funding may be reduced or eliminated 
we currently receive approximately million per year in payments from the federal universal service fund in connection with our puerto rico operations  based on fcc rules that make such funding available to competitive carriers  including wireless carriers  operating in areas where the established landline carrier also receives such funding 
however  universal service fund support for our puerto rico operations is scheduled to be eliminated by or sooner 
we have applied to receive additional funding pursuant to these rules in four states 
however  these fcc rules are currently under review and may be changed in a way that materially reduces or eliminates our right to obtain such funding  including the amounts we currently receive in puerto rico 
wireless devices may pose health and safety risks  and driving while using a wireless phone may be prohibited  as a result  we may be subject to new regulations  and demand for our services may decrease 
media reports have suggested that  and studies have been undertaken to determine whether  certain radio frequency emissions from wireless handsets and cell sites may be linked to various health concerns  including cancer  and may interfere with various electronic medical devices  including hearing aids and pacemakers 
in addition  lawsuits have been filed against other participants in the wireless industry alleging various adverse health consequences as a result of wireless phone usage 
if consumers health concerns over radio frequency emissions increase  they may be discouraged from using wireless handsets and regulators may impose restrictions on the location and operation of cell sites 
these concerns could have an adverse effect on the wireless communications industry and expose wireless providers to litigation  which  even if not successful  can be costly to defend 
government authorities might increase regulation of wireless handsets and cell sites as a result of these health concerns and wireless companies might be held liable for costs or damages associated with these concerns 
the actual or perceived risk of radio frequency emissions could also adversely affect us through a 
table of contents reduced subscriber growth rate  a reduction in our subscribers  reduced network usage per subscriber or reduced financing available to the wireless communications industry 
in addition  the perceived safety risk associated with the use of a wireless device while driving may also adversely affect our results of operations 
studies have indicated that using wireless devices while driving may impair a driver s attention 
the us congress has proposed legislation that would seek to withhold a portion of federal funds from any state that does not enact legislation prohibiting an individual from using a wireless telephone while driving motor vehicles 
in addition  many state and local legislative bodies have passed and proposed legislation to restrict the use of wireless telephones while driving motor vehicles 
concerns over safety risks and the effect of future legislation  if adopted and enforced in the areas we serve  could limit our ability to market and sell our wireless services 
in addition  these concerns and this legislation may discourage use of our wireless devices and decrease our revenue from customers who now use their wireless telephones while driving 
further  litigation relating to accidents  deaths or serious bodily injuries allegedly incurred as a result of wireless telephone use while driving could result in damage awards against telecommunications providers  adverse publicity and further governmental regulation 
any or all of these results  if they occur  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our network capacity and customer service system may not be adequate and may not expand quickly enough to support our anticipated customer growth 
our financial and operational success depends on assuring that we have adequate capacity and a sufficient customer support system to accommodate anticipated new customers and the related increase in usage of our network 
the network capacity plan relies on the availability of wireless telephones of the appropriate model and type to meet the demands and preferences of our customers  the ability to obtain and construct additional cell sites and other infrastructure equipment  and the ability to obtain additional spectrum if required  in addition  we must develop effective procedures for customer activation  customer service  billing and other support services 
reliance on our customer service functions will increase as we add new customers 
our failure to timely and efficiently meet the demands for these services could decrease or slow subscriber growth or delay or otherwise impede billing and collection of amounts owed  which would adversely affect our revenue 
we cannot make assurances that our customer service systems and network capacity will expand quickly enough to keep up with our anticipated customer growth  and failure to do so would impair our ability to compete  which would adversely affect our results and financial operations 
risks related to our capital structure we will require a significant amount of capital in the future to meet our substantial debt obligations and to maintain and develop our business and operations 
our ability to generate this capital depends on many factors beyond our control 
we are a highly leveraged company 
at may   on a pro forma basis after giving effect to our offering of senior notes in june  we would have had approximately billion of consolidated long term debt 
our ability to make payments on our debt and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future 
our fiscal  and scheduled amortization payments on all our debt will be approximately million  million and million  respectively 
our capital expenditures were approximately million for fiscal net cash provided by operations for fiscal was million 

table of contents our substantial debt service obligation could have important consequences to investors in our securities  including the following limit our ability to borrow money or sell stock to fund our working capital  capital expenditures  debt service requirements or other purposes  increase our vulnerability to compete effectively or operate successfully under adverse economic and industry conditions  limit our ability to obtain additional financing and our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business or the industry  the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal of  and interest on  our debt and would not be available for other purposes  increase our vulnerability to interest rate increases as the borrowings under our senior credit facility are at variable interest rates  place us at a competitive disadvantage to many of our competitors who are less leveraged than we are  and suffer a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition if we were unable to service our indebtedness or obtain additional financing  as needed 
while all term loan tranches under the senior credit facility require quarterly amortization payments  the b and c tranches of the senior credit facility require substantial payments upon final maturity in may and november  respectively  and all amounts outstanding under the revolver of the senior credit facility will become due in november additionally  the million credit facility which banco popular de puerto rico provides to our subsidiary  centennial puerto rico cable tv corp  pursuant to which million is outstanding as of may   matures in installments through fiscal that credit facility is guaranteed by centennial puerto rico 
we expect  based on our indebtedness as of may   after giving effect to our senior notes offering and the application of the proceeds received  that we will have long term indebtedness of million and million that will become due in and  respectively 
we do not expect our business to generate cash flow from operations in an amount sufficient to enable us to repay this indebtedness when it comes due 
as a result  we believe we will need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness prior to may however  we may not be able to refinance any or all of our indebtedness on favorable terms or at all 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
the senior notes mature in june  the senior subordinated notes due  or senior subordinated notes  mature in december  and the unsecured subordinated notes due  or mezzanine debt  matures in july we cannot make assurances that we will be able to refinance any of our debt on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
despite our substantial indebtedness  we may still be able to incur significantly more debt  which would further reduce the cash we have available to invest in our operations or to service our debt obligations 
the terms of the indentures governing our senior notes and senior subordinated notes  as well as the credit agreement governing the senior credit facility and the agreements governing our other indebtedness  limit  but do not prohibit  the incurrence of significant additional indebtedness by us and our subsidiaries in the future 
as of may   on a pro forma basis after giving effect to our offering of the senior notes in june  we would have had approximately million available for additional borrowings  as permitted  under the senior credit facility 
the more we become leveraged  the more we  and in turn the holders of our common stock and our indebtedness  become exposed to the risks described above 
if we do not generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service and to fund our working capital requirements  we may need to seek additional financing or sell certain of our assets 

table of contents our debt instruments include restrictive and financial covenants that limit our operating flexibility  a significant portion of our indebtedness may have to be refinanced on or prior to may our senior credit facility and the indentures governing our senior notes and our senior subordinated notes contain covenants that  among other things  require us to maintain certain financial ratios and restrict our ability to take specific actions  even if we believe such actions are in our best interest 
these include restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt  incur additional debt that ranks senior to or equally with the senior notes  create liens or negative pledges with respect to our assets  pay dividends or distributions on  or redeem or repurchase  our capital stock  make investments  loans or advances or other forms of payments  make capital expenditures  issue  sell or allow distributions on capital stock of specified subsidiaries  prepay or defease specified indebtedness  enter into transactions with affiliates  or merge  consolidate or sell our assets 
these restrictions are subject to important qualifications 
as of may   on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the offering of the senior notes  we had approximately million outstanding under the senior credit facility 
we currently anticipate that we will not be able to satisfy one of our financial covenants in the senior credit facility  beginning in may as a result  management currently expects that the senior credit facility will have to be refinanced at or before that time 
we might not be able to successfully access the capital markets to refinance this debt  in which case this debt and our other debt could be accelerated 
if we fail to meet our payment or other obligations under the senior credit facility  the lenders could foreclose on and acquire control of substantially all of our assets 
in connection with the incurrence of the indebtedness under the senior credit facility  the lenders have received a pledge of all of the capital stock of centennial cellular  our wholly owned subsidiary through which we hold the assets of all of our subsidiaries  and that of its existing and future direct and indirect subsidiaries but not to exceed of the voting stock of the foreign subsidiaries 
additionally  our lenders generally have a lien on all of the personal property assets tangible and intangible and certain of the real property assets of centennial cellular and these subsidiaries 
as a result of these pledges and liens  if we fail to meet our payment or other obligations under the senior credit facility  the lenders would be entitled to foreclose on and liquidate substantially all of our assets  to the extent required to pay obligations under the senior credit facility 
under those circumstances  we may not have sufficient funds to service our other indebtedness 
as a result  the holders of our securities may lose a portion of or the entire value of their investment in our securities 
because we do not intend to pay dividends  stockholders will benefit from an investment in our common stock only if it appreciates in value 
we have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock and currently do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
the terms of our senior credit facility and our indentures governing our senior notes and our senior subordinated notes restrict our ability to declare or pay dividends on our common stock 
we intend to retain any future earnings to fund our operations  debt service requirements and other corporate needs 
no dividends can be paid on our common stock without the approval 
table of contents of our controlling stockholders 
accordingly  investors in our common stock will not receive a return on their investment in our common stock through the payment of dividends in the foreseeable future 
as a result  the success of an investment in our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in its value  and investors in our common stock may not realize a return on their investment even if they sell their shares of our common stock 
there is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which stockholders have purchased their shares 
because we are a holding company  our ability to declare dividends is effectively limited to the amount of dividends  if any  our subsidiaries and other equity holdings may distribute to us 
future sales of our common stock may depress the market price of our common stock 
if our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market  the market price of our common stock could fall 
these sales also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at times and prices that we deem appropriate 
we have entered into a registration rights agreement with the welsh carson investors  the blackstone group investors and certain other stockholders 
the registration rights agreement provides  among other things  that holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock held by either of the welsh carson investors or the blackstone group investors may request that we register all or any portion of the shares they then hold 
if the welsh carson investors or the blackstone group investors exercise their registration rights under this agreement to sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market  or if it is perceived that such exercise and sale could occur  the market price of our common stock could fall 
the price of our common stock may be volatile and will depend on a variety of factors  some of which are beyond our control 
the market price of our common stock has historically experienced and may continue to experience significant volatility 
during the twelve months ended may   the market price of our common stock ranged from to per share 
the market price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors  some of which are beyond our control 
these factors include  but are not limited to  our historical and anticipated operating results  technological or regulatory changes in our industry  announcements or actions by our competitors  low trading volume in our common stock and general market and economic conditions 
these factors could cause our common stock to trade at prices below the price which holders of our common stock paid for their shares  which could prevent investors in our common stock from selling their common stock at or above the price at which they purchased their shares 
in addition  the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices of securities 
these fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of publicly traded companies 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company 
if similar litigation were instituted against us  it could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources from our operations 
a group of affiliated stockholders controls the voting power of centennial and may have interests adverse to the interests of other common stockholders 
welsh carson  certain of its affiliates and certain other equity investors  including affiliates of the blackstone group and some of our executive officers and directors  collectively hold approximately of centennial s outstanding shares of common stock 
accordingly  these equity investors  directly or indirectly  control our company and have the power to elect all of our directors  appoint new management and approve or reject any action requiring the approval of stockholders  including adopting amendments to our charter and approving mergers and sales of all or substantially all of our assets 
these equity investors may make decisions that are adverse to the interests of other stockholders 
in addition  as of may   affiliates of welsh carson currently hold approximately million principal amount of our existing senior subordinated notes and all of the mezzanine debt 
the existence of a controlling stockholder group may have the effect of making it difficult for a third party to acquire  or of discouraging or delaying a third party from seeking to 
table of contents acquire  a majority of our outstanding common stock  which may adversely affect the market price of the stock 
provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and delaware law may make it more difficult for investors in our common stock to receive a change in control premium on our common stock 
our board of directors ability to designate and issue up to  shares of preferred stock and issue up to approximately  additional shares of common stock  giving effect to the increase in authorized shares pursuant to the amendment to our certificate of incorporation which will take effect on september   could materially and adversely affect the voting power of the holders of common stock  and could have the effect of making it more difficult for a person to acquire  or could discourage a person from seeking to acquire  control of our company 
if this occurred  investors in our common stock could lose the opportunity to receive a premium on the sale of their shares in a change of control transaction 
in addition  the delaware general corporation law contains provisions that would have the effect of restricting  delaying and or preventing altogether certain business combinations with an interested stockholder 
interested stockholders include  among others  any person who  together with affiliates and associates  becomes the owner  or within three years became the owner  of or more of a corporation s voting stock 
these provisions could also limit an investor s ability to receive a premium in a change of control transaction

item legal proceedings we are party to several lawsuits in which plaintiffs have alleged  depending on the case  breach of contract  misrepresentation or unfair practice claims relating to our billing practices  including rounding up of partial minutes of use to full minute increments  billing send to end  and billing for unanswered and dropped calls 
the plaintiffs in these cases have not alleged any specific monetary damages and are seeking certification as a class action 
a hearing on class certification in one of these cases is to be held on september  in state court in louisiana 
damages payable by us could be significant  although we do not believe any damage payments would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in april  whtv broadcasting corp 
and sala foundation inc  operators of a wireless cable system in puerto rico  filed an action against us in the united states district court for the district of puerto rico 
the complaint alleges that we breached the terms of a november letter of intent to purchase the wireless cable system for million 
the complaint seeks specific performance of the letter of intent or not less than million in damages 
the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty  and accordingly  the aggregate ultimate liability of centennial  if any  with respect to these matters is not determinable at this time 
to our knowledge  there are no other material pending legal proceedings to which we or our subsidiaries are a party or of which any of our property is subject that is likely to have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading regional wireless and broadband wireline and cable television telecommunications service provider serving over one million customers in markets covering over million net pops in the united states and the neighboring caribbean 
in the united states  we are a regional wireless service provider in small cities and rural areas in two geographic clusters covering parts of six states which we refer to as us wireless 
in our puerto rico based caribbean service area  which also includes operations in the dominican republic and the us virgin islands  we are a facilities based  fully integrated communications service provider offering both wireless which we refer to as caribbean wireless and  in puerto rico and the dominican republic  broadband services which we refer to as caribbean broadband to business and residential customers 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with item selected consolidated financial data and our financial statements and the related notes included in this report 
those statements in the following discussion that are not historical in nature should be considered to be forward looking statements that are inherently uncertain 
please see cautionary statement for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of critical accounting policies the following discussion and analysis is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and disclosures 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition wireless revenue 
we recognize wireless service revenue in the period the service is provided to our customers 
services billed in advance are recognized as income when earned 
revenue from sales of handsets and accessories are recognized in the period these products are sold to the customer 
we have multiple billing cycles  all of which span our quarter ends 
as a result of our billing cycle cut off times  we are required to make estimates for service revenue earned but not yet billed at the end of each quarter 
these estimates are based primarily on the actual results of the immediately preceding comparable billing cycle 
actual billing cycle results and related revenue may vary  depending on subscriber usage and rate plan mix  from the results estimated at the end of each quarter 
revenue from activation fees is recognized over the expected customer service period  ranging from to months 
revenue from other services is recognized when earned 
broadband revenue 
we recognize revenue from cable television installation fees to the extent of direct selling costs in the period the installation is provided to the customer 
revenue from prepaid long distance cards is recognized as the customer uses the minutes on the cards 
revenue from other services is recognized when earned 
revenue from equipment sales are recognized in the period these products are sold to the customer 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses  which result from our customers not making required payments 
we base our allowance on the likelihood of recoverability of our subscriber accounts receivable based on past experience and by reviewing current collection trends that are expected to continue 
if economic or industry trends worsen beyond our estimates  we would increase our allowance for doubtful accounts by recording additional expense 

table of contents valuation of long lived assets long lived assets such as property  plant and equipment  certain license costs and customer lists are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
in our valuation  we consider current market values of properties similar to our own  competition  prevailing economic conditions  government policy including taxation and the historical and current growth patterns of both our business and the industry 
we also consider the recoverability of the cost of our long lived assets based on a comparison of estimated undiscounted operating cash flows for the related businesses  with the carrying value of the long lived assets 
considerable management judgment is required to estimate the impairment and fair value of assets 
estimates related to asset impairment are critical accounting policies as management must make assumptions about future revenue and related expenses over the life of an asset  and the effect of recognizing impairment could be material to our consolidated financial position as well as our consolidated results of operations 
actual revenue and costs could vary significantly from such estimates 
in july  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 business combinations  or sfas no 
sfas no 
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  sfas no 
also sets forth recognition criteria for intangible assets other than goodwill as well as disclosure requirements for business combinations 
we adopted sfas no 
on july  in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  or sfas no 
sfas no 
changes the accounting for goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
goodwill and certain intangible assets will remain on the consolidated balance sheet and not be amortized 
on an annual basis  and when there is reason to suspect that their values have been diminished or impaired  these assets must be tested for impairment  and write downs may be necessary 
we adopted sfas no 
effective june  in conjunction with the adoption of sfas no 
 we reassessed the useful lives of previously recognized intangible assets 
a significant portion of our intangible assets are licenses  including licenses associated with equity method investments  that provide our wireless operations with the exclusive right to utilize radio frequency spectrum designated on the license to provide wireless communication services 
while wireless licenses are issued for only a fixed time  generally ten years  the us wireless and puerto rico pcs licenses are subject to renewal by the fcc 
historically  renewals of licenses through the fcc have occurred routinely and at nominal cost 
moreover  we have determined that there are currently no legal  regulatory  contractual  competitive  economic or other factors that limit the useful life of our us wireless and puerto rico pcs licenses 
our cable franchises in puerto rico are issued for either ten or twenty year periods  and are subject to renewal by trb 
the trb s process for granting cable franchise renewals is routine and renewals are more likely than not to be granted 
additionally  we have determined that there are currently no legal  regulatory  contractual  competitive  economic or other factors that limit the useful life of our puerto rico cable franchises 
as a result  the us wireless and puerto rico pcs licenses and the cable franchise costs will be treated as indefinite lived intangible assets under the provisions of sfas no 
and will not be amortized but rather will be tested for impairment 
we will reevaluate the useful life determination for us wireless and puerto rico pcs licenses and the puerto rico cable franchise costs each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life 
previous wireless and cable business combinations have been for the purpose of acquiring existing licenses and related infrastructure to enable us to build out our existing networks 
the primary assets acquired in such combinations have been wireless licenses and cable franchises 
in the allocation of the purchase price of certain of these previous acquisitions  amounts classified as goodwill have related predominately to the deferred tax effects of the acquired us wireless licenses and cable franchise costs 
except for these deferred tax effects  the excess of the purchase price over the other acquired net assets was accounted for as us wireless licenses and cable franchises 
we believe that the nature of our us wireless licenses and related goodwill and our cable franchises and the related goodwill are fundamentally indistinguishable 
prior to the 
table of contents adoption of sfas no 
 we amortized both us wireless licenses and the related goodwill  and cable franchise costs and the related goodwill  over the same respective periods using the straight line method 
in conjunction with the adoption of sfas no 
 we reclassified approximately million of us wireless goodwill to us wireless licenses and approximately million of caribbean broadband goodwill to cable franchise costs 
amounts for fiscal year have been reclassified to conform to the presentation adopted on june  in connection with these reclassifications  we recorded an additional deferred tax liability of million as of june   in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  the offsetting increase related to recognizing this deferred tax liability was recorded to us wireless licenses and cable franchise costs  consistent with the approach of treating us wireless licenses and cable franchise costs of million and million  respectively  as the excess in the purchase price allocations for transactions in which the predominant assets acquired were us wireless licenses and cable franchises 
this reclassification  including the related impact of deferred taxes  had no effect on our consolidated results of operations 
as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
 previously recorded goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to impairment tests 
when testing the carrying value of these assets for impairment  we will determine  within each operation  the fair value of aggregated indefinite lived intangible assets by subtracting from each operations discounted cash flows the fair value of all of the other net tangible and intangible assets of each operation 
we performed goodwill and intangible asset impairment analysis during the year ended may  based on recent net subscriber loss and the estimated resulting loss of future revenue and in accordance with sfas no 
 during the year ended may   we recorded a pretax impairment charge of million to the cable franchise cost asset in the caribbean broadband business 
in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  or sfas no 
 during the year ended may   we performed an impairment evaluation of our long lived assets in our caribbean broadband business because we determined that certain undersea cable assets will be underutilized 
we performed asset impairment tests at the reporting unit level  the lowest level at which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets 
the tests were performed by comparing the aggregate undiscounted cash flows to the carrying amount of the long lived assets 
accordingly  we determined that certain undersea cable assets should be considered impaired based on future revenue and the related costs of those revenue 
the undersea cable assets are a component of property  plant and equipment  net in the consolidated balance sheet 
as a result of this evaluation  we recorded a pretax million impairment charge on these assets during the year ended may  derivative financial instruments we use financial derivative instruments as part of our overall risk management strategy 
these instruments are used to manage risk related to changes in interest rates 
our portfolio of derivative financial instruments consists of interest rate swap and collar agreements 
we use interest rate swap agreements to modify variable rate obligations to fixed rate obligations  thereby reducing our exposure to higher interest rates 
we use interest rate collar agreements to lock in a maximum interest rate if interest rates rise  but allow us to otherwise pay lower market rates  subject to a floor 
amounts paid or received under interest rate swap agreements are accrued as interest rates change with the offset recorded in interest expense 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no

sfas no 
is to be applied prospectively to all contracts entered into or modified after june  and for hedging relationships designated after june  however  the provisions of this statement that relate to sfas implementation issues  which have been effective for fiscal quarters beginning prior to june   continue to be applied in accordance with their respective 
table of contents effective dates 
we are in the process of assessing the effect of adopting sfas no 
on our consolidated results of operations  consolidated financial position or consolidated cash flows 
during the twelve months ended may   we recorded a reduction of million  net of tax  in other comprehensive loss attributable to fair value adjustments of interest rate swap and collar agreements 
we also decreased our liabilities by million as a result of adjusting the carrying amounts of our derivatives to reflect their fair values at may  stock based compensation stock based compensation issued to employees and directors is valued using the intrinsic value method under accounting principles board opinion no

sfas no 
also amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosure in both annual and interim consolidated financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
we are required to adopt the transition elements of sfas no 
and the annual financial statement reporting requirements for the fiscal year ended may  we will adopt the interim periods reporting disclosure requirements of sfas no 
during the interim period ended august  certain non gaap financial measures regulation g  conditions for use of non gaap financial measures  and other provisions of the exchange act define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non gaap financial information in sec filings 
throughout this report  we present certain financial measures that are not calculated and presented in accordance with gaap  including adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income margin 
we previously referred to these non gaap financial measures in our sec filings  press releases and other communications with investors as adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin 
the change to adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income margin are changes in name only and we have not changed the way we calculate current or prior results with respect to these financial measures 
we view adjusted operating income as an operating performance measure  and as such we believe that the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to it is net income or net loss 
in calculating adjusted operating income  we exclude from net income or net loss the financial items that we believe have less significance to the day to day operation of our business 
we have outlined below the type and scope of these exclusions and the limitations on the use of these non gaap financial measures as a result of these exclusions 
adjusted operating income is not an alternative to net income  operating income or cash flows from operating activities as calculated and presented in accordance with gaap  and adjusted operating income margin is not an alternative to net income margin  operating income margin or any other ratios calculated using gaap financial measures 
investors or potential investors in our securities should not rely on adjusted operating income or adjusted operating income margin as a substitute for any gaap financial measures or ratios calculated in accordance with or derived from gaap financial measures 
in addition  our calculation of adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income margin may or may not be consistent with that of other companies 
we strongly urge investors or potential investors in our securities to review the reconciliation of adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income margin to comparable gaap financial measures that are included in this report and our financial statements  including the notes thereto  and the other 
table of contents financial information contained in this report and our other sec filings and to not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business 
adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income margin are used by our management as supplemental financial measures to evaluate the performance of our business that  when viewed with our gaap results and the accompanying reconciliations  we believe provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than the gaap results alone 
management also uses these financial measures as one of several criteria to determine the achievement of performance based cash bonuses 
we also regularly communicate our adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income margin to the public through our earnings releases because they are the financial measures commonly used by analysts that cover our industry and our investor base to evaluate our performance 
we understand that analysts and investors regularly rely on non gaap financial measures  such as adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income margin  to provide a financial measure by which to compare a company s assessment of its operating performance against that of other companies in the same industry 
these non gaap financial measures are helpful in more clearly reflecting the sales of our products and services  as well as highlighting trends in our core businesses that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on gaap financial measures  because these non gaap financial measures eliminate from earnings financial items that have less bearing on our performance 
in addition  as our calculation of adjusted operating income is similar  but not identical  to certain financial ratios used in the financial covenants of our senior credit facility and the indentures governing our senior subordinated notes and senior notes and since we do not publicly disclose the calculations of these financial ratios  adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income margin are the most comparable financial measures that are readily available to investors to evaluate our compliance with our financial covenants 
the term adjusted operating income as used in this report refers to  for any period  earnings before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  minority interest in income loss of subsidiaries  income tax benefit expense  other non operating income loss  net interest expense  income from equity investments  gain loss on disposition of assets  recapitalization costs  loss on impairment of assets  special non cash charge and depreciation and amortization 
adjusted operating income margin as used in this report refers to the ratio of adjusted operating income to consolidated total revenue or total revenue for each of our business segments  as the case may be 
set forth below are descriptions of the financial items that have been excluded from our earnings to calculate adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income margin and the material limitations associated with using these non gaap financial measures as compared to the use of the most directly comparable gaap financial measures the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle was recorded during fiscal and represents the effect of a change in accounting principle related to certain activation fees charged to customers  and recorded as revenue  to conform our revenue recognition policies to the requirements of the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition in financial statements 
this change in accounting principle generated a one time non cash charge in fiscal  which we believe is not indicative of our core operating performance 
minority interest in income loss of subsidiaries relates to our minority investors proportionate share of income or losses in our non wholly owned subsidiaries  which generated non cash charges to our operating results 
operating results attributable to these minority investors investments do not necessarily result in any actual benefit or detriment to us and  therefore  we believe it would be more helpful for an investor to exclude such items as being more reflective of our core operating performance 
management does not consider income tax benefit expense when considering the profitability of our core operations 
nevertheless  the amount of taxes we are required to pay reduces the amount of funds otherwise available for use in our business and thus may be useful for an investor to consider 

table of contents other non operating income loss relates to foreign currency translation losses in our operations in the dominican republic because some of our revenue in the dominican republic is collected in local currency  the dr peso 
although foreign currency translation gains or losses have a cash effect on our results  because some of our costs incurred in the dominican republic are paid in us dollars  by excluding them we are better able to evaluate the real effects of changes in our core operating performance 
the amount of interest expense we incur is significant and reduces the amount of funds otherwise available to use in our business and  therefore  is important for investors to consider 
however  management does not consider the amount of interest expense when evaluating our core operating performance 
income from equity investments relates to our proportionate share of income or loss from the entities in which we hold minority interests 
we do not control these entities and  as such  do not believe the income we receive from such entities is indicative of our core operating performance 
gain loss on the disposition of assets may increase or decrease the cash available to us and thus may be important for an investor to consider 
we are not in the business of acquiring or disposing of assets and  therefore  the effect of the disposition of assets may not be comparable from year to year 
we believe such gains or losses recorded on the disposition of an asset do not reflect the core operating performance of our business 
the recapitalization costs relate to our only recapitalization that occurred in january as such  we do not believe these costs are relevant to an understanding of our core operating performance 
impairment of assets is a non cash charge incurred as a result of changes in the valuations of our assets 
although it is important to recognize that some of our assets have decreased in value  we do not believe it is indicative of our core operating performance 
the special non cash charge relates to disputed billings that arose in prior fiscal years with the prtc 
we recorded this charge in the second quarter of fiscal as a result of recent developments in these disputes and the protracted negotiations with prtc concerning the disputed billings 
while these charges reduce cash available to us  due to newly negotiated interconnection rates with prtc  we believe disputed charges will become less material in future periods 
depreciation and amortization are important for investors to consider  even though they are non cash charges  because they represent generally the wear and tear on our plant and equipment  which produce our revenue 
we do not believe these charges are indicative of our core operating performance 
management compensates for the above described limitations of using non gaap financial measures by using non gaap financial measures only to supplement our gaap results to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business

us wireless service revenue increased million  or  to million for the year ended may  as compared to the same period last year 
the increase was primarily due to growth in revenue from new subscribers of million and an increase in service revenue per subscriber of million as compared to the same period last year 
roaming revenue decreased by million to million  or  for the year ended may  from million for the year ended may  the decrease was primarily the result of a lower average roaming rate per minute in fiscal than in fiscal this roaming rate variance resulted in a decrease in total roaming revenue of million and was offset by higher revenue of million associated with a higher number of roaming minutes of use 
we anticipate that roaming revenue will be approximately million lower in fiscal than in fiscal  primarily due to declines in contractual roaming rates 
we expect the trend of a decreasing roaming rate per minute  partially offset by an increase in roaming usage  to continue

cost of services decreased million  or  for the year ended may   as compared to the year ended may   primarily due to a decrease in incollect cost  which was driven primarily by lower incollect roaming rates 
during the fiscal year ended may   we entered into long term roaming 
table of contents agreements with at t wireless and cingular wireless 
as part of these roaming agreements  we significantly reduced the rates we pay when our customers roam on their networks 
we do not expect the cost of services to decline as significantly in fiscal as compared to fiscal sales and marketing expenses decreased million  or  for the year ended may  as compared to the prior year  primarily due to a reduction in the sales force and lower commissions relating to lower activations in the current year as compared to the prior year

cost of equipment sold increased million  or  during the year ended may   as compared to the same period last year 
the increase was primarily due to increases in the number of premium phones sold and increases in phones used for upgrades and retention plan exchanges

these increases were partially offset by reduced cost of services due to the sale of our interest in cdj in august sales and marketing expenses decreased million  or  during the year ended may  as compared to the same period last year

the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification provisions is potentially unlimited 
however  we have never incurred any material costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification agreements 
as a result  we believe the estimated fair value of these agreements is minimal and considered to be immaterial to the consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  or fin fin addresses whether certain types of entities  referred to as variable interest entities  or vies  should be consolidated in a company s financial statements 
a vie is an entity that either has equity investors that lack certain essential characteristics of a controlling financial interest including the ability to control the entity  the obligation to absorb the entity s expected losses and the right to receive the entity s expected residual returns  or lacks sufficient equity to finance its own activities without financial support provided by other entities  which in turn would be expected to absorb at least some of the expected losses of the vie 
an entity should consolidate a vie if it stands to absorb a majority of the vie s expected 
table of contents losses or to receive a majority of the vie s expected residual returns 
fin is effective immediately for all vie s created after january  and for the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  for vie s in which an enterprise holds a vie that it acquired before february  we have evaluated the effect of the adoption of fin  and do not believe it will have a material effect on our company s consolidated results of operations  consolidated financial position or consolidated cash flows

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risks due to fluctuations in interest rates 
a majority of our long term debt has variable interest rates
