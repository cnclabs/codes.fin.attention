we may be unable to renew leases or relet space as leases expire 
if tenants do not to renew their leases upon expiration  we may be unable to relet the subject space 
even if the tenants do renew their leases or we can relet the space  the terms of renewal or reletting including the cost of required renovations may be less favorable than current lease terms 
certain leases grant the tenants an early termination right upon payment of a termination penalty 
for additional detail on the risk of non renewal of expiring leases  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tenant rollover risk 

back to contents new development and acquisitions may not produce results in accordance with our expectations and may require development and renovation costs exceeding our estimates 
once made  our investments may not produce results in accordance with our expectations 
our actual renovation and improvement costs in bringing an acquired property up to market standards may exceed our estimates 
in addition  we are active in developing and redeveloping office properties 
risks associated with these activities include the unavailability of favorable financing  including permanent financing to repay construction financing  construction costs exceeding original estimates  construction and lease up delays resulting in increased debt service and construction costs  complications including building moratoriums and anti growth legislation in obtaining necessary zoning  occupancy and other governmental permits  and insufficient occupancy levels and rental rates at a newly completed property causing the property to be unprofitable 
for additional detail on development risks  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations development risk 
some potential losses are not covered by insurance 
we carry comprehensive liability  fire  extended coverage and rental loss insurance on all of our properties 
we believe the policy specifications and insured limits of these policies are adequate and appropriate 
there are  however  types of losses  such as lease and other contract claims and acts of war  that generally are not insured 
some of our existing insurance policies expire in july we cannot be assured that we will be able to renew insurance coverage in an adequate amount or at reasonable prices 
in addition  insurance companies may no longer offer coverage against certain types of losses  such as losses due to terrorist acts and mold  or  if offered  these types of insurance may be prohibitively expensive 
should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur  we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property  as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property 
in such an event  we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property 
we cannot be assured that material losses in excess of insurance proceeds will not occur in the future 
if any of our properties were to experience a catastrophic loss  it could seriously disrupt our operations  delay revenue and result in large expenses to repair or rebuild the property 
such events could adversely affect our cash flow and ability to make distributions to shareholders 
because real estate is illiquid  we may not be able to sell properties when appropriate 
real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly 
we may not be able to vary our portfolio promptly in response to economic or other conditions 
in addition  the internal revenue code of the code limits our ability to sell properties held for fewer than four years 
furthermore  properties that we acquired in exchange for units in the operating partnership often have a low tax basis 
if we were to dispose of any of these properties in a taxable transaction  we may be required to distribute a significant amount of the taxable gain to our security holders under the requirements of the internal revenue code of applicable to reits and this could  in turn  impact our cash flow and ability to make distributions to shareholders 
in addition  purchase options and rights of first refusal held by certain tenants or partners in real estate ventures may also limit our ability to sell certain properties 
any of these factors could 
back to contents adversely affect our cash flow and ability to make distributions to shareholders as well as the ability of someone to purchase us  even if a purchase were in our shareholders best interests 
we have agreed not to sell certain of our properties 
we have agreed with the former owners of of our properties aggregating approximately million net rentable square feet not to sell these properties for varying periods of time in transactions that would trigger taxable income to the former owners  subject to certain exceptions 
some of these agreements are with affiliates of current trustees of our company 
in addition  we may enter into similar agreements with sellers of properties acquired by us in the future 
these agreements generally provide that we may dispose of the applicable properties in transactions that qualify as tax free exchanges under section of the code or in other tax deferred transactions 
such transactions can be difficult and result in the property acquired in exchange for the disposed of property inheriting the tax attributes including tax protection covenants of the disposed of property 
without suffering adverse financial consequences  we may be precluded from selling certain properties other than in transactions that would qualify as tax free exchanges for federal income tax purposes 
our operating costs might rise  which might reduce our profitability and have an adverse effect on our cash flow and our ability to make distributions to shareholders 
we might face higher operating expenses as a result of rising costs generally and following the terrorist attacks in the us on september  in particular 
for example  it might cost more in the future than in the past for building security  property casualty and liability insurance  and property maintenance 
following the september th attacks  we have increased the level of security at our properties 
we might not be able to pass along the increased costs associated with such increased building security to our tenants  which could reduce our profitability and cash flow 
some of our existing insurance policies expire in july as a result of the terrorist attacks and other market conditions  the cost of premiums for comparable coverage might be significantly higher when it is time to renew our coverage  which could increase our operating expenses and reduce our profitability and our cash flow 
because of rising costs in general  we might experience increases in our property maintenance costs  such as for cleaning  electricity  and heating  ventilation and air conditioning 
in general  under our leases with tenants  we pass on a portion of these costs to them 
we cannot be assured  however  that tenants will actually bear the full burden of these higher costs  or that such increased costs will not lead them  or other prospective tenants  to seek office space elsewhere 
if operating expenses increase  the availability of other comparable office space in our specific geographic markets might limit our ability to increase rents  which could reduce our profitability if operating expenses increase without a corresponding increase in revenues and limit our ability to make distributions to shareholders 
we face significant competition from other real estate developers 
we compete with real estate developers  operators and institutions for tenants and acquisition and development opportunities 
some of these competitors have significantly greater financial resources than we do 
such competition may reduce the number of suitable investment opportunities offered to us  interfere with our ability to attract and retain tenants and may increase vacancies  which increases supply and lowers market rental rates  reduces our bargaining leverage and adversely affects our ability to improve our operating leverage 
we cannot be assured that this competition will not adversely affect our cash flow and ability to make distributions to shareholders 
our ability to make distributions is subject to various risks 
we have been paying quarterly distributions to our shareholders 
our ability to make distributions in the future will depend upon the operational and financial performance of our properties  
back to contents capital expenditures with respect to existing and newly acquired properties  the amount of  and the interest rates on  our debt  and the absence of significant expenditures relating to environmental and other regulatory matters 
certain of these matters are beyond our control and any significant difference between our expectations and actual results could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow and our ability to make distributions to shareholders 
changes in the law may adversely affect our cash flow 
because increases in income and service taxes are generally not passed through to tenants under leases  such increases may adversely affect our cash flow and ability to make expected distributions to shareholders 
the properties are also subject to various regulatory requirements  such as those relating to the environment  fire and safety 
our failure to comply with these requirements could result in the imposition of fines and damage awards 
also  the costs to comply with any new or different regulations could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to make distributions 
while we believe that the properties are currently in material compliance with all such requirements  we cannot be assured that these requirements will not change or that newly imposed requirements will not require significant unanticipated expenditures 
our indebtedness subjects us to additional risks 
debt financing and existing debt maturities 
like other real estate companies  we are subject to risks normally associated with debt financing  such as the insufficiency of cash flow to meet required debt service payment obligations and the inability to refinance existing indebtedness 
if our debt cannot be paid  refinanced or extended at maturity  in addition to our failure to repay our debt  we may not be able to make distributions to shareholders at expected levels or at all 
furthermore  an increase in our interest expense could adversely affect our cash flow and ability to make distributions to shareholders 
if we do not meet our debt service obligations  any properties securing such indebtedness could be foreclosed on  which would have a material adverse effect on our cash flow and ability to make distributions and  depending on the number of properties foreclosed on  could threaten our continued viability 
risk of rising interest rates and variable rate debt 
increases in interest rates on variable rate indebtedness would increase our interest expense  which could adversely affect our cash flow and ability to make distributions to shareholders 
as of december   outstanding borrowings of approximately million bear interest at variable rates 
no limitation on debt 
our organizational documents do not contain any limitation on our ability to incur additional debt 
accordingly  subject to limitations in our credit facilities  we could increase our outstanding debt without restriction 
the increased debt service could adversely affect our cash flow and ability to make distributions and could increase the risk of default on our indebtedness 
environmental problems at the properties are possible and may be costly 
federal  state and local laws  ordinances and regulations may require a current or previous owner or operator of real estate to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or releases at such property 
the owner or operator may be forced to pay for property damage and for investigation and clean up costs incurred by others in connection with environmental contamination 
such laws typically impose clean up responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants 
even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination  each person covered by the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the clean up costs incurred 
in addition  third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from that site 
these costs may be substantial 
back to contents and the presence of such substances may adversely affect the owner s ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral 
environmental laws that govern the presence  maintenance and removal of asbestos require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos  notify and train those who may come into contact with asbestos and undertake special precautions  including removal or other abatement  if asbestos would be disturbed during renovation or demolition of a building 
such laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos fibers 
independent environmental consultants have conducted a standard phase i or similar general environmental site assessment esa of each of our properties to identify potential sources of environmental contamination and assess environmental regulatory compliance 
for a number of the properties  the phase i esa either referenced a prior phase ii esa obtained on such property or prompted us to have a phase ii esa of such property conducted 
a phase ii esa generally involves invasive procedures  such as soil sampling and testing or the installation and monitoring of groundwater wells 
while the esas conducted have identified environmental contamination on a few of the properties  they have not revealed any environmental contamination  liability or compliance concern that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our cash flow or ability to make distributions to shareholders 
it is possible that the existing esas relating to the properties do not reveal all environmental contaminations  liabilities or compliance concerns which currently exist  and it is also possible that the cost of remediating identified contamination may exceed current estimates 
in addition  future properties which we acquire may be subject to environmental conditions 
while we have an ongoing maintenance program in place to address indoor air quality  inquiries about indoor air quality may necessitate special investigation and  depending on the results  remediation 
indoor air quality issues can stem from inadequate ventilation  chemical contaminants from indoor or outdoor sources  and biological contaminants such as molds  pollen  viruses and bacteria 
indoor exposure to chemical or biological contaminants above certain levels can be alleged to be connected to allergic reactions or other health effects and symptoms in susceptible individuals 
if these conditions occur at one of our properties  we may need to undertake a targeted remediation program  including without limitation  steps to increase indoor ventilation rates and eliminate sources of contaminants 
such remediation programs are costly and could necessitate the temporary relocation of some or all of the property s tenants or require rehabilitation of the affected property 
americans with disabilities act compliance could be costly 
under the americans with disabilities act of ada  all public accommodations and commercial facilities must meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons 
compliance with the ada requirements could involve removal of structural barriers from certain disabled persons entrances 
other federal  state and local laws may require modifications to or restrict further renovations of our properties with respect to such accesses 
although we believe that our properties are substantially in compliance with present requirements  noncompliance with the ada or related laws or regulations could result in the united states government imposing fines or private litigants being awarded damages against us 
such costs may adversely affect our cash flow and ability to make distributions 
by holding properties through the operating partnership and various joint ventures  we are exposed to additional risks 
we own the properties and interests in real estate ventures through the operating partnership 
in the future  we expect to continue to participate with other entities in property ownership through joint ventures or partnerships 
partnership or joint venture investments may involve risks not otherwise present in direct investments 
such risks include 
back to contents the potential bankruptcy of our partners or co venturers  a conflict between our business goals and those of our partners or co venturers  and actions taken by our partners or co venturers contrary to our instructions or objectives 
there is no limitation under our organizational documents as to the amount of funds which we may invest in partnerships or joint ventures 
our status as a reit is dependent on compliance with federal income tax requirements 
our failure to qualify as a reit would have serious adverse consequences to our shareholders 
we believe that since  we have qualified for taxation as a reit for federal income tax purposes 
we plan to continue to meet the requirements for taxation as a reit 
many of these requirements are highly technical and complex 
the determination that we are a reit requires an analysis of various factual matters and circumstances that may not be totally within our control 
for example  to qualify as a reit  at least of our gross income must come from certain sources that are itemized in the reit tax laws 
we are also required to distribute to shareholders at least of our reit taxable income excluding net capital gains 
the fact that we hold our assets through the operating partnership and its subsidiaries further complicates the application of the reit requirements 
even a technical or inadvertent mistake could jeopardize our reit status 
furthermore  congress and the irs might change the tax laws and regulations  and the courts might issue new rulings that make it more difficult  or impossible  for us to remain qualified as a reit 
we do not believe  however  that any pending or proposed tax law changes would jeopardize our reit status 
to maintain reit status  a reit may not own more than of the stock of any corporation  except for a qualified reit subsidiary which must be wholly owned by the reit  taxable reit subsidiary or another reit 
if we fail to qualify as a reit  we would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates 
also  unless the irs granted us relief under certain statutory provisions  we would remain disqualified as a reit for four years following the year we first failed to qualify 
if we failed to qualify as a reit  we would be required to pay significant income taxes and would  therefore  have less money available for investments or for distributions to shareholders 
this would likely have a material adverse effect on the value of our securities 
in addition  we would no longer be required to make any distributions to shareholders 
in order to make the distributions required to maintain our reit status  we may need to borrow funds 
to obtain the favorable tax treatment associated with reit qualification  we generally will be required to distribute to shareholders at least of our annual reit taxable income excluding net capital gains 
in addition  we will be subject to tax on our undistributed net taxable income and net capital gain and a nondeductible excise tax on the amount  if any  by which certain distributions paid by us with respect to any calendar year are less than the sum of of ordinary income plus of capital gain net income for the calendar year  plus certain undistributed amounts from prior years 
we intend to make distributions to shareholders to comply with the distribution provisions of the code and to avoid income and other taxes 
our income will consist primarily of our share of the income of the operating partnership and our cash flow will consist primarily of our share of distributions from the operating partnership 
differences in timing between the receipt of income and the payment of expenses in arriving at taxable income of the company or the operating partnership and the effect of required debt amortization payments could require us to borrow funds on a short term basis or to liquidate funds on adverse terms to meet the reit qualification distribution requirements 
failure of the operating partnership or a subsidiary partnership to be treated as a partnership would have serious adverse consequences to our shareholders 
if the irs were to successfully challenge the tax status of the operating partnership or any of its subsidiary partnerships for federal income tax purposes  the 
back to contents operating partnership or the affected subsidiary partnership would be taxable as a corporation 
in such event  we would cease to qualify as a reit and the imposition of a corporate tax on the operating partnership or a subsidiary partnership would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution from such partnership to us and our shareholders 
we do pay some taxes 
even if we qualify as a reit  we are required to pay certain federal  state and local taxes on our income and properties 
in addition  the management company is subject to federal  state and local income tax at regular corporate rates on its net taxable income derived from its management  leasing and related service business 
if we have net income from a prohibited transaction  such income will be subject to a tax 
we own a subsidiary reit 
one of our subsidiaries  atlantic american properties trust aapt  that indirectly holds of the properties  elected to be taxed as a reit for the year ended december  so long as we seek to maintain aapt s reit status  aapt will be subject to all the requirements and risks associated with maintaining reit status summarized above  including the limitation on the ownership of more than of the securities of any corporation other than a qualified reit subsidiary  taxable reit subsidiary or another reit 
we are dependent upon our key personnel 
we are dependent upon the efforts of our executive officers  particularly gerard h 
sweeney 
the loss of mr 
sweeney s services could have an adverse affect on our operations and would entitle the banks under our credit facility to accelerate the amounts due thereunder 
although we have an employment agreement with mr 
sweeney for a term extending to may   this agreement does not restrict his ability to become employed by a competitor following the termination of his employment with us 
we do not have keyman life insurance coverage for mr 
sweeney 
certain limitations exist with respect to a third party s ability to acquire us or effectuate a change in control 
limitations imposed to protect our reit status 
in order to protect us against loss of our reit status  our declaration of trust limits any shareholder from owning more than in value of our outstanding shares  subject to certain exceptions 
the ownership limit may have the effect of precluding acquisition of control of the company 
if anyone acquires shares in excess of the ownership limit  we may consider the transfer to be null and void  not reflect the transaction on our books  institute legal action to stop the transaction  not pay dividends or other distributions with respect to those shares  not recognize any voting rights for those shares  and consider the shares held in trust for the benefit of a person to whom such shares may be transferred 
limitation due to our ability to issue preferred shares 
our declaration of trust authorizes the board of trustees to issue preferred shares 
the board of trustees may establish the preferences and rights of any preferred shares issued which could have the effect of delaying or preventing someone from taking control of us  even if a change in control were in our shareholders best interests 
limitations imposed by the maryland business combination law 
the maryland general corporation law  as applicable to maryland real estate investment trusts  establishes special restrictions against 
back to contents business combinations between a maryland real estate investment trust and interested shareholders or their affiliates unless an exemption is applicable 
an interested shareholder includes a person who beneficially owns  and an affiliate or associate of the trust who  at any time within the two year period prior to the date in question  was the beneficial owner of  ten percent or more of the voting power of our then outstanding voting shares 
among other things  the law prohibits for a period of five years a merger and certain other transactions between the trust and an interested shareholder unless the board of trustees approved the transaction before the party became an interested shareholder 
the five year period runs from the most recent date on which the interested shareholder became an interested shareholder 
thereafter  any such business combination must be recommended by the board of trustees and approved by two super majority shareholder votes unless  among other conditions  the trust s common shareholders receive a minimum price for their shares and the consideration is received in cash or in the same form as previously paid by the interested shareholder for its shares or unless the board of trustees approved the transaction before the party in question became an interested shareholder 
the business combination statute could have the effect of discouraging offers to acquire us and of increasing the difficulty of consummating any such offers  even if our acquisition would be in our shareholders best interests 
we have exempted any business combination involving safeguard scientifics  inc  the commonwealth of pennsylvania state employees retirement system and a voting trust established for its benefit  morgan stanley asset management inc and two funds managed by it  lazard freres real estate investors  llc  five arrows realty securities iii llc  gerard h 
sweeney the company s president and chief executive officer and any of their respective affiliates or associates 
maryland control share acquisition act 
maryland law provides that control shares of a real estate investment trust acquired in a control share acquisition shall have no voting rights except to the extent approved by a vote of two thirds of the vote eligible to be cast on the matter under the maryland control share acquisition act 
control shares means shares that  if aggregated with all other shares previously acquired by the acquirer  would entitle the acquirer to exercise voting power in electing trustees within one of the following ranges of voting power one tenth or more but less than one third  one third or more but less than a majority or a majority or more of all voting power 
a control share acquisition means the acquisition of control shares  subject to certain exceptions 
if voting rights or control shares acquired in a control share acquisition are not approved at a shareholder s meeting  then subject to certain conditions and limitations the issuer may redeem any or all of the control shares for fair value 
if voting rights of such control shares are approved at a shareholder s meeting and the acquirer becomes entitled to vote a majority of the shares entitled to vote  all other shareholders may exercise appraisal rights 
any control shares acquired in a control share acquisition which are not exempt under our bylaws will be subject to the maryland control share acquisition act 
many factors can have an adverse effect on the market value of our securities 
like any publicly traded company  a number of factors might adversely affect the price of our securities  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include increases in market interest rates  relative to the dividend yield on our shares 
if market interest rates go up  prospective purchasers of our securities may require a higher yield 
higher market interest rates would not  however  result in more funds for us to distribute and  to the contrary  would likely increase our borrowing costs and potentially decrease funds available for distribution 
thus  higher market interest rates could cause the market price of our common shares to go down 
anticipated benefit of an investment in our securities as compared to investment in securities of companies in other industries including benefits associated with tax treatment of dividends and distributions 
perception by market professionals of reits generally and reits comparable to us in particular 

back to contents perception by market participants of our potential for payment of cash distributions and for growth 
level of institutional investor interest in our securities 
relatively low trading volumes in securities of reits 
our results of operations and financial condition 
the issuance of preferred securities may adversely affect the rights of holders of common shares 
because the board of trustees has the power to establish the preferences and rights of each class or series of preferred shares  it may afford the holders in any series or class of preferred shares preferences  distributions  powers and rights  voting or otherwise  senior to the rights of holders of common shares 
the board of trustees also has the power to establish the preferences and rights of each class or series of units in the operating partnership  and may afford the holders in any series or class of preferred units preferences  distributions  powers and rights  voting or otherwise  senior to the rights of holders of common units

see item business risk factors 
overview the company currently manages its portfolio within three geographic segments pennsylvania  new jersey and virginia 
the company believes it has established an effective platform in these office and industrial markets that provides a foundation for achieving its goals of maximizing market penetration and optimizing operating economies of scale 
during  the company sold office and industrial properties  containing million net rentable square feet  and two parcels of land  containing acres  for million 
the company also acquired 
back to contents seven office properties  containing  net rentable square feet  and one parcel of land  containing acres  for million 
the company receives income primarily from rental revenue including tenant reimbursements from the properties and  to a lesser extent  from the management of properties owned by third parties and from investments in the real estate ventures 
the company s financial performance is dependent upon the demand for office and other commercial space in its markets 
current economic conditions  including recessionary pressures and capital market volatility  have enhanced the challenges facing the company 
in the current economic climate  the company continues to seek revenue growth through an increase in occupancy of its portfolio at december  
however  with a downturn in general leasing activity  owners of commercial real estate  including the company  are experiencing longer periods in which to lease unoccupied space  and may face higher capital costs and leasing commissions to achieve targeted tenancies 
as the company seeks to increase revenue  management also focuses on strategies to minimize operating risks  including i tenant rollover risk  ii tenant credit risk and iii development risk 
tenant rollover risk the company is subject to the risk that  upon expiration  leases may not be renewed  the space may not be relet  or the terms of renewal or reletting including the cost of renovations may be less favorable than the current lease terms 
leases accounting for approximately of the aggregate annualized base rents from the properties as of december  representing approximately of the net rentable square feet of the properties expire without penalty through the end of the company maintains an active dialogue with its tenants in an effort to achieve a high level of lease renewals 
the company s retention rate for leases that were scheduled to expire in the year ended december  was 
if the company is unable to renew leases for a substantial portion of the space under expiring leases  or to promptly relet this space  at anticipated rental rates  the company s cash flow could be adversely impacted 
tenant credit risk in the event of a tenant default  the company may experience delays in enforcing its rights as a landlord and may incur substantial costs in protecting its investment 
management regularly evaluates its accounts receivable reserve policy in light of its tenant base and general and local economic conditions 
the accounts receivable allowances were million or of total receivables including accrued rent receivable as of december  compared to million or of total receivables including accrued rent receivable as of december  development risk the company currently has in development or redevelopment three sites aggregating  square feet 
the total cost of these projects is estimated to be million  of which million was incurred as of december  as of december   these projects were approximately leased 
while the company is actively marketing space at these projects to prospective tenants  management cannot provide assurance as to the timing or terms of any leases of such space 
as of december   the company owned approximately acres of undeveloped land and held options to purchase approximately additional acres 
risks associated with development of this land include construction cost overruns and construction delays  insufficient occupancy rates and inability to obtain necessary zoning  land use  building  occupancy and other required governmental approvals 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting 
back to contents principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included this annual report on form k 
while the estimates and judgments associated with the application of these accounting policies may be affected by different assumptions or conditions  the company believes the estimates and judgments associated with the reported amounts are appropriate in the circumstances 
the following explains several of the company s critical accounting policies that are used in preparing the company s consolidated financial statements which require the company s management to use significant judgment and estimates revenue recognition rental revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the lease term regardless of when payments are due 
certain lease agreements contain provisions that require tenants to reimburse a pro rata share of real estate taxes and certain common area maintenance costs 
real estate investments real estate investments are carried at cost 
the company records acquisition of real estate investments under the purchase method of accounting and allocates the purchase price to land  buildings and intangible assets on a relative fair value basis 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the useful lives of buildings and capital improvements to years and over the shorter of the lease term or the life of the asset for tenant improvements 
direct construction costs related to the development of certain properties and land holdings are capitalized as incurred 
the company expenses routine repair and maintenance expenditures 
impairment of long lived assets management reviews investments in real estate and real estate ventures for impairment if facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
measurement of any impairment loss will be based on the fair value of the asset determined using customary valuation techniques  such as the present value of expected future cash flows 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  long lived assets  such as real estate investments and purchased intangibles subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell  and are no longer depreciated 
the assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts that represents an estimate of losses that may be incurred from the inability of tenants to make required payments 
the allowance is an estimate based on two calculations that are combined to determine the total amount reserved 
first  the company evaluates specific accounts where it has been determined that a tenant may have an inability to meet its financial obligations 
in these situations  the company uses its judgment  based on the facts and circumstances  and records a specific reserve for that tenant against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount that the company expects to collect 
these reserves are reevaluated and adjusted as additional information becomes available 
second  a reserve is established for all tenants based on a range of 
back to contents percentages applied to aging categories 
these percentages are based on historical collection and write off experience 
if the financial condition of the company s tenants were to deteriorate  additional allowances may be required 
deferred costs the company incurs direct costs related to the financing and leasing of the properties 
management is required to use professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed 
capitalized financing fees are amortized over the related loan term and capitalized leasing costs are amortized over the related lease term 
management re evaluates the remaining useful lives of leasing costs as the creditworthiness of the company s tenants and economic and market conditions change

non gaap supplemental financial measure funds from operations industry analysts generally consider funds from operations an alternative measure of performance for an equity reit 
the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit in its march white paper as clarified by the november nareit national policy bulletin which became effective on january  defines funds from operations to mean net income loss before minority interests of common unitholders computed in accordance with gaap  excluding extraordinary items  as defined by gaap  and gains and losses from sales of depreciable operating property  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and depreciation of non real estate assets  and after adjustment for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 

back to contents the company considers funds from operations an appropriate alternative measure of performance for an equity reit because it is predicated on cash flow analyses 
while funds from operations is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of equity reits  other equity reits may use different methodologies for calculating funds from operations and  accordingly  funds from operations as disclosed by such other reits may not be comparable to funds from operations published by the company in this report 
therefore  the company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the historical operating results of the company  funds from operations should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in the financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
funds from operations should not be considered as a substitute to net income loss computed in accordance with gaap as an indicator of the company s financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities computed in accordance with gaap as an indicator of the company s liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund the company s cash needs  including the company s ability to pay dividends or make distributions

in addition  many of the office leases provide for fixed base rent increases 
the company believes that inflationary increases in expenses will be significantly offset by expense reimbursement and contractual rent increases

as of december   the company s consolidated debt consisted of million in fixed rate mortgages and million in variable rate mortgage notes  million borrowed under its credit facility and million under its term loan 
all financial instruments were entered into for other than trading purposes and the net market value of these financial instruments is referred to as the net financial position

back to contents portfolio 
a change in interest rates on the fixed portion of the debt portfolio impacts the net financial instrument position  but has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows 
a change in interest rates on the variable portion of the debt portfolio impacts the interest incurred and cash flows  but does not impact the net financial instrument position 
the company has entered into interest rate swap and rate cap agreements designed to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on its variable rate debt 
at december   the company had interest rate swap agreements for notional principal amounts aggregating million 
the swap agreements effectively fix the libor interest rate on million of credit facility borrowings at and on million of credit facility borrowings at  in each case until june the interest rate cap agreement effectively limits the interest rate on a mortgage with a notional value of million at until july the impact of the cap agreement is recorded as a component of interest expense 
the sensitivity analysis related to the fixed portion of the company s debt portfolio assumes an instantaneous move in interest rates from their actual levels at december  with all other variables held constant 
as of december   a increase in actual interest rates would result in a decrease in beneficiaries equity of million and a decrease in actual interest rates would result in an increase in beneficiaries equity of million 
based on the company s variable rate debt as of december   a increase in interest rates would result in an additional million in interest expense per year and a decrease would reduce interest expense by million per year
