overview we develop  manufacture and sell easy to use glucose self monitoring systems that dramatically reduce the pain of testing for people with diabetes 
our first product  freestyle  received fda clearance in january  and we commenced commercial shipments in the united states in june we sell freestyle in the united states and canada through national retailers and wholesalers  and directly to consumers over the telephone and through our website 
in march  we obtained the ce mark for freestyle  and our european distributor commenced sales of freestyle in germany and sweden in may and commenced sales of freestyle in finland  austria  norway  the netherlands  denmark  switzerland  france  italy and belgium since that time 
in january  we obtained regulatory approval to market freestyle in japan  and our japanese distributor launched freestyle in japan in february we also sell freestyle in the united kingdom through retailers and wholesalers 
our sales of freestyle products in canada and the united kingdom are through a wholly owned subsidiary in each country 
we manufacture our disposable test strips ourselves at our facility in alameda  california 
we outsource the manufacturing  packaging and testing of our freestyle meters to flextronics international ltd  an electronics contract manufacturer 
our freestyle lancing device and disposable lancets are manufactured by facet technologies llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of matria healthcare  inc our distribution services are performed by ups supply chain management f d b a livingston health care systems inc  a division of ups global logistics 
manufacturers typically sell their glucose monitoring system kits at discounts to list prices  offer customer rebates or provide free product samples to expand their installed base of monitoring devices and thus increase the market for their disposable test strips and lancets 
we currently distribute the freestyle system kit at a financial loss due in part to samples  discounts and rebates to establish an installed base of systems from which we expect to generate recurring revenues from our disposable freestyle test strips and lancets 
we have been offering and expect to continue to offer similar discounts and rebates on  and free samples of  our freestyle system kits 
in 
table of contents the event we establish a large installed base of systems  we expect to generate an increasing portion of our revenues through recurring sales of our freestyle test strips 
revenues are generated from sales of our freestyle system kit and from the recurring sales of disposable freestyle test strips and lancets 
we recognize revenue on these products upon shipment 
generally  our sales terms to retailers and wholesalers provide for customer payment within days of shipment on initial orders and payment within days for subsequent orders 
however  we have occasionally granted longer credit terms to match our competitors 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and  generally  require no collateral from our customers 
we believe our terms to retailers  wholesalers and end users  including rights to return and payment terms  are similar to our competitors terms 
we have incurred significant operating losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception 
we incurred net losses of million in  million in and million in as of december  we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we will need to continue to increase product revenues and reduce product costs to achieve profitability 
cost of revenues consists primarily of payments to our manufacturing and distribution partners  expenses relating to our disposable test strip manufacturing  expenses relating to our internal operations  expenses relating to our five year warranty on our freestyle meter  royalties payable under technology licenses  and amortization of deferred stock based compensation 
research and development expenses include costs associated with the design  development and testing of our products 
all research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
these costs consist primarily of salaries and related personnel expenses  fees paid to outside service providers  expenditures for purchases of laboratory supplies and clinical trials  overhead allocated to product development  and amortization of deferred stock based compensation 
selling  general and administrative expenses primarily consist of salaries  commissions and related expenses for personnel engaged in sales  marketing  customer service and administrative functions  costs associated with advertising  product sampling  trade shows  promotional and other marketing activities  general corporate expenses  legal and regulatory expenses  and amortization of deferred stock based compensation 
we estimate the uncollectability of our accounts receivable 
in doing so  we analyze historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms 

table of contents we have recorded deferred stock based compensation in connection with stock option grants and sales of restricted stock to employees at exercise or sales prices below the deemed fair market value of our common stock 
deferred stock based compensation for options granted to non employees has been determined as the fair value of the equity instruments issued 
deferred stock based compensation for options granted to non employees is periodically remeasured as the underlying options vest 
as of december  we have recorded aggregate deferred stock based compensation of million  of which million will be amortized to expense on a straight line basis through this amount is being amortized over the respective vesting periods of these equity instruments  which is typically four years 
stock based compensation expense has been allocated according to employees and their respective departments and by function for non employees 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to investments  income taxes  litigation and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management has discussed each of the critical accounting policies and estimates described below with the audit committee of our board of directors 
revenue recognition we believe the following allowances and reserves which are utilized to reduce gross sales to an amount which we recognize as revenue represent our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
for proper matching of costs and revenues  these allowances and reserves are created in the period when the revenue is recognized based on anticipated future events 
if there are unanticipated changes in future events  then a reserve or allowance may need to be adjusted to a revised level impacting the period in which the adjustment is taken and causing variability in our financial results 
allowances for sales returns 
our return policy allows end users in the united states and canada to return freestyle system kits to us for a full cash refund within days of purchase 
there are no end user return rights on sales of freestyle test strips and lancets 
in addition  our freestyle system kit and freestyle test strips currently have an month shelf life  and retailers and wholesalers in the united states and canada can return these products to us up to six months beyond this expiration date 
we use historical trends and experience to estimate future product returns and create an allowance for sales returns 
for the year ended december   the allowance for sales returns was of gross sales 
in the years ended december  and  we did not have sufficient historical trends to estimate an allowance for sales returns 
as a result  we deferred the recognition of revenue on sales of freestyle test strips until resold by retailers and wholesalers to end users  and we deferred recognition of revenue on freestyle system kits until days after purchase by the end user 
reserve for consumer rebates 
freestyle system kits sold through retailers and wholesalers generally include a consumer rebate 
based on historical trends and experience we determine a reserve for consumer rebates by applying an estimate of future redemption rates to the base of freestyle system kits sold through retailers and wholesalers 
for the year ended december   the reserve for consumer rebates was of gross sales 
in the years ended december  and  we did not have sufficient historical experience to estimate a reserve for consumer rebates 
as a result  we assumed a redemption rate 

table of contents reserve for sales coupons 
we utilize sales coupons to promote sales to end users in the united states of america 
historically  our coupon programs have primarily promoted the sale of our freestyle system kits 
these coupons are distributed through retailer circulars  national print advertisings  and direct mail programs 
they are also distributed to health care professionals through our direct sales force 
based on historical trends and experience  we determine a reserve for sales coupons by estimating a future redemption rate for each promotional program and applying it to the applicable base of outstanding coupons 
this estimate is difficult because each promotional program has unique characteristics and there is a substantial lag between distribution of the coupon and its redemption 
there is a time lag between when the coupon is distributed and when an end user takes it to a retailer 
the retailer then waits until a number of coupons have been accumulated before sending them to our third party processor 
for the years ended december   and  the reserves for sales coupons were  and of gross sales  respectively 
the decrease reflects increased sales of freestyle test strips versus freestyle system kits and increased revenue from international sales of our freestyle products as a percentage of our total revenues 
reserve for warranties we believe the following reserve which is utilized to determine our cost of revenues represents one of our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
our freestyle meter is sold with a five year warranty 
our reserve for warranties is estimated in the period that revenues are recognized and is determined based on historical trends and experience with warranty replacement and the cost of replacement 
for the years ended december   and  the reserves for warranties were  and of gross sales  respectively 
the decrease reflects historical experience with a lower number of warranty returns and lower cost of warranty replacement due to lower freestyle meter production costs 
inventory reserves we believe the following reserves which are utilized to reduce the value of our inventory represent one of our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
our inventory reserves are primarily related to our inventory of freestyle system kits 
we employ two types of inventory reserves net realizable value reserve  or nrv reserve  and excess and obsolete reserve  or e o reserve 
both the nrv reserves and e o reserves are based on management s analysis of inventory levels and sales forecasts 
nrv reserve 
when the market value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory  we establish a nrv reserve 
the market value of our inventory is based on the average sales price of the product  less reserves for returns  rebates and coupons and estimated selling expenses 
we have been offering and expect to continue to offer discounts and rebates on our freestyle system kits to establish an installed base of systems from which we expect to generate recurring revenues from our disposable freestyle test strips and lancets 
the cost of our inventory is based on standard cost  which approximates actual cost on a first in first out basis 
as of december  and  our nrv reserve was approximately and of finished goods inventory  respectively 
this decrease reflects the reduction of our freestyle system kit manufacturing costs 
as of december   we did not have a nrv reserve as the market value for our freestyle system kits equaled or exceeded their costs 
e o reserve 
we also establish an e o reserve to adjust the carrying value of impaired inventories to salvage or recoverable value 
excess inventory is defined as the inventory in stock beyond the next twelve months of estimated demand 
obsolete inventory is defined as in stock inventory that either has not sold through within six months of taking title to the inventory or is no longer used in finished goods due to product changes 
as of december   we did not have any e o reserve as we commenced commercial sales of our freestyle products in the second half of the year 
as of december   our e o reserve was approximately of total inventory resulting primarily from our transition to a lower cost freestyle system kit 
as of 
table of contents december   we did not have any e o reserve as none of our inventory fell within our e o reserve policy 
allowance for doubtful accounts we believe the following allowances and reserves which are utilized to reduce our accounts receivable to an amount that we believe can be collected from our customers represent one of our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
in estimating the uncollectability of our accounts receivable  we analyze historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms 
in  our four or more customers accounted for of our revenues 
in  our two or more customers accounted for of our revenues 
in  our two or more customers accounted for of our revenues 
generally  we do not require collateral from our domestic customers  and we do not require collateral from our two principal international distributors 
for our other international customers  accounts receivable balances are generally collateralized by irrevocable letters of credit 
our estimate for the allowance for doubtful accounts related to accounts receivable is based on two methods 
the amounts calculated for each of these methods are combined to determine the total amount reserved 
first  we evaluate specific accounts where we have information that the customer may have an inability to meet its financial obligations 
in these cases  we use our judgment  based on the best available facts and circumstances  and record a specific reserve for that customer against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount that is expected to be collected 
these specific reserves are reevaluated and adjusted as additional information is received that impacts the amount reserved 
second  a general reserve is established for all customers based on a percentage applied to the outstanding accounts receivable amount 
this percentage is based on historical collection and write off experience 
as of december   and  the allowance for doubtful accounts was  and of accounts receivable  respectively 
the increase in reflects an increase in our general reserve for sales to a new class of customers  and we decreased our general reserve to an amount in line with our reserve based on our historical experience with these customers 
if circumstances change  such as higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligation to us  our allowance for doubtful accounts could be increased 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth  for the fiscal years indicated  the percentage of total revenues represented by certain items reflected in our consolidated statements of operations years ended december  revenues product sales license income research grant revenue total revenues cost of revenues gross profit loss operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative total operating expenses loss from operations interest income interest and other expense net loss years ended december   and revenues 
revenues recognized in totaled million  principally consisting of product sales of freestyle system kits and freestyle test strips  which commenced in june revenues in also included million from a specific non refundable negotiation fee related to a potential distribution arrangement  which was never consummated

as of december   deferred revenue  awaiting sale through to end users and for the day cash refund period on freestyle system kit sales to lapse  was approximately million 
revenues in also included million related to the million distribution agreement payment received from nipro 
revenues recognized in totaled million  principally consisting of sales of freestyle test strips and freestyle system kits 
this includes a million contribution from achieving the ability to estimate product return rates for sales to retailers and wholesalers in the united states and canada beginning with the quarter ended june  prior to the quarter ended june  we deferred revenue recognition until product had been purchased by an end user and all rights of return had lapsed 
the increase in total revenues over the comparable period of was before the million contribution 
the increase in revenues from to is primarily attributable to an increase in our installed base of end users resulting in increased sales of freestyle products to our customers and our expansion into international markets 
we believe that revenues 
table of contents for will be greater than revenues for but the percentage increase will be substantially lower than the increase in revenues compared to revenues 
due to the recognition of previously deferred revenues from product sales during the quarter ended june   there were no deferred revenues from product sales as of december  in  one of our customers  cardinal health  and our european distributor  disetronic  individually accounted for more than and collectively accounted for approximately of our product shipments for that year 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues in was million and was comprised of internal manufacturing costs  purchase costs for freestyle system kits and freestyle lancets from our contract manufacturing partners  costs of product warranties  royalties payable under technology licenses  start up production costs and a million charge to reduce freestyle system kit inventories to estimated net realizable value 
amortization of deferred stock based compensation reported in cost of revenues for was insignificant 
prior to commencing commercial shipments of freestyle in june  costs associated with start up manufacturing related activities  including stock based compensation expense  were reported as research and development expenses 
there was no cost associated with the license fee income earned in cost of revenues in was million  attributable to product sales  as there was no cost associated with the license fee income earned 
the increase in cost of revenues from to is primarily attributable to increased purchases of freestyle system kits and freestyle lancets from our contract manufacturing partners 
as a percentage of revenues  the cost of revenues in was versus in this decrease reflects increased sales of lower cost freestyle test strips versus freestyle system kits 
amortization of deferred stock based compensation reported in cost of revenues for the year ended december  was million  as compared to an insignificant amount in the prior year 
cost of revenues in was million and was attributable to product sales 
the increase in cost of revenues from to is primarily attributable to increased purchases of freestyle system kits and freestyle lancets from our contract manufacturing partners 
this increase includes a million charge associated with the recognition of previously deferred revenues 
the increase in cost of revenues over the comparable period of was excluding the million charge 
this increase is due to higher total revenues  which grew by compared with total revenues for the comparable period in  before the million contribution 
as a percentage of revenues and after excluding the million contribution to revenues and the million charge  the cost of revenues in was versus in this decrease reflects increased sales of lower cost freestyle test strips versus freestyle system kits and manufacturing cost reductions for freestyle test strips and freestyle system kits 
amortization of deferred stock based compensation reported in cost of revenues for the year ended december  was million  as compared to million in the prior year 
we believe that  as a percentage of revenues  cost of revenues will be lower in than in research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased from million in to million in to million in the increase from to was primarily attributable to million from increased spending on product development efforts  million from hiring additional personnel and million spent on clinical trials 
prior to commencing commercial shipments of freestyle in june  costs associated with start up manufacturing activities were reported as research and development expenses 
these expenses  which occurred in the first half of  totaled million  partially offsetting the increase in research and development expenses for the year ended december  over research and development expenses for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenues  research and development expenses in were versus in the increase from to was primarily attributable to million from increased spending on product development efforts  million from hiring additional personnel and million spent on clinical trials 
as a percentage of revenues  research and development expenses in were versus in amortization of deferred stock based compensation increased from million in to million in and remained at million in we expect research and development spending to increase in absolute dollars over the next several years as we 
table of contents increase clinical trials for our continuous glucose monitoring system and expand our research and development activities to support our current and future products 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in and to million in the increase from to was primarily attributable to increases of million for marketing activities and other spending associated with expanding distribution and developing consumer awareness of freestyle  including product sampling  million for personnel costs largely related to expanding our us direct sales force as well as marketing and business support functions  million spent for customer service and support operations  and million for travel costs  largely related to our sales force 
as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses in were versus in the increase from to was primarily attributable to increases of million for our retail sales force and personnel costs related to expanding our us and international sales force  million spent on product sampling  advertising  trade shows  exhibits and meetings  million for our international expansion  million for sales data services and computer services  and million for travel costs 
as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses in were versus in amortization of deferred stock based compensation increased from million in to million in and to million in we expect our selling  general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we increase product sampling  expand our sales force  increase our marketing and promotional activities  and operate as a public company 
as a percentage of revenues  we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to decrease in interest income 
interest income increased from million in  to million in and to million in interest income increased in from due to higher average cash  cash equivalents and investments balances  resulting from the net proceeds of a private equity offering closed in april and from the net proceeds of our initial public offering in october interest income in from increased slightly due to the full year effect of higher average cash  cash equivalents and investments balances  resulting from the net proceeds of our initial public offering in october  offset by the cash consumed during interest and other expense 
interest and other expense has remained at approximately million in  and interest expense reflects the interest on additional borrowings under available lines of credit  amortization of debt issuance costs associated with warrants issued in connection with lines of credit and capital lease obligations arising under a particular sale and leaseback transaction 
provision for income taxes 
we incurred net operating losses for the years ended december   and and  accordingly  we did not pay any federal or state income taxes 
as of december   we had accumulated approximately million and million in federal and state net operating loss carryforwards  respectively  to reduce future taxable income 
if not utilized  the federal carryforward will expire in various amounts beginning in  and the state carryforward will expire in our net operating loss carryforwards are subject to annual limitation under internal revenue code section due to substantial changes in ownership 
ownership changes as defined by internal revenue code section have already occurred as a result of certain of our equity financings 
we have not recorded a benefit from our net operating loss carryforwards because we believe that it is uncertain that we will have sufficient income from future operations to realize the carryforwards prior to their expiration 
accordingly  we have established a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset arising from the carryforwards 
we also had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards as of december  of approximately million and million  respectively 
if not utilized  the federal research credit will expire in various amounts beginning in the state research credit can be carried forward indefinitely 
dividends related to beneficial conversion feature of preferred stock 
the difference between the preferred stock purchase price and the fair market value of our common stock on the preferred stock issuance date resulted in a beneficial conversion feature  which has been reflected as preferred stock dividends 
dividends relating to

cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative total operating expenses loss from operations interest income  net net loss revenues 
the increase in revenues reflects increased market acceptance of freestyle 
the increase in revenue in the quarter ended june  includes a million contribution from achieving the ability to estimate product return rates for sales to retailers and wholesalers in the united states and canada 
we believe that revenues for the first quarter of will be lower than revenues in the fourth quarter of  as we balance and reduce inventory levels in our distribution channels 
gross profit 
gross profit is influenced by both sales volume and the product mix between freestyle system kits and freestyle test strips  as we currently distribute the freestyle system kit at a financial loss due in part to samples  discounts and rebates 
the sequential increase in gross profit resulted from higher sales volume and an increased percentage of freestyle test strip revenues versus freestyle system kit revenues 
also favorably influencing gross profit has been our ability during to reduce the manufacturing costs of both the freestyle system kit and freestyle test strips by and  respectively 
the gross profit in the quarter ended june  includes a million contribution from achieving the ability to estimate product return rates for sales to retailers and wholesalers in the united states and canada 
operating expenses 
the increase in cost of revenues for the quarter ended june  includes a million charge associated with the recognition of previously deferred revenues 
our research and development efforts are periodically subject to significant non recurring costs and fees that can cause significant variability in our quarterly research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased 
table of contents during and due to increased spending on product development efforts  hiring of additional personnel  and clinical trials 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased throughout and  reflecting increased personnel costs  including recruiting and hiring our us direct sales force  advertising  marketing and other spending associated with the launch of freestyle 
in addition  costs were incurred related to increases in product sampling to stimulate consumer adoption of freestyle 
liquidity and capital resources on october  we consummated our initial public offering of common stock in which we received net proceeds of million 
previously  we have financed our operations primarily through private placements of convertible preferred stock resulting in net proceeds of million 
we have also financed our operations through equipment financing arrangements and capital leases with million in principal outstanding at december our current principal debt arrangements include a million equipment line of credit at effective interest rates between and per annum with a lending company  a million equipment line of credit at an interest rate of with a lending company and a million senior loan and security agreement at an effective interest rate of per annum with a lending company 
these effective annual interest rates include the amortization of the fair value of warrants issued to one of the lending companies 
in march  we entered into an arrangement to finance the purchase of certain equipment we use to manufacture our freestyle test strips with our supplier of test strip packaging vials 
the purchase price of the equipment is approximately million 
the financed purchase price has an interest rate of per year 
we pay the equipment purchase price to the supplier through a portion of the purchase price for each packaging vial purchased from the supplier 
as of december   we have paid to the supplier approximately  consisting of approximately  in principal and approximately  in interest  pursuant to the financing arrangement 
we will take title to the equipment once the equipment purchase price has been paid in full 
we must pay the equipment purchase price to the supplier by not later than june the supplier has financed the equipment pursuant to a loan arrangement with a bank 
the supplier s loan obligations to the bank are collateralized by the equipment 
if the supplier defaults on its loan obligations to the bank  we must assume and satisfy the supplier obligations to the bank in order to take title to the equipment 
in may  we entered into a revolving line of credit agreement with a lending company  which was amended and restated in december under the terms of the credit agreement  amounts we borrow from the lending company are repaid to the lending company directly by our accounts receivable debtors 
outstanding amounts owed to the lending company under the credit agreement are collateralized by all of our assets excluding our intellectual property assets 
the maximum amount we may borrow from the lending company is based on our eligible accounts receivable and cannot exceed million 
all outstanding amounts bear interest at the prime rate plus 
as of december   million in principal was outstanding under the credit agreement 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and investments of million 
in the first quarter of  we received a million payment from disetronic  our european distributor  pursuant to the amendment of our international distributor agreement 
we will recognize this payment over the remaining term of the international distributor agreement  which will expire in december cash used in operating activities 
net cash used in operating activities was approximately million  million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
for the year ended december   increases in accounts receivable and inventories were partially offset by increases in deferred revenue  accounts payable  and accrued liabilities  which reflect commencement of commercial product shipments in june for the year ended december   increases in deferred revenues in line with increased revenues  accounts payable as our operations expanded  and accrued liabilities due to increasing reserves for rebates and marketing costs exceeded the increases in accounts receivable and 
table of contents inventories due to our expanding operations  reduced the net cash used in operating activities in for the year ended december   decreases in deferred revenues due to estimations based on historical trends  accounts payable due to controlled disbursements  and increases in accounts receivable and inventories as we expanded operations  increased the net cash used in operating activities in cash provided by or used in investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities was approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
for these periods  investing activities consisted of capital expenditures of million and million  respectively  and purchases  net of maturities  of investments of million and million  respectively 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by investing activities  totaling million  included million in proceeds from the sale of capital assets under sale and leaseback transactions and million in capital expenditures 
cash provided by financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities was approximately million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the net cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to the proceeds from private placements of equity securities  proceeds from long term borrowings  and proceeds from initial public offering in october during  the company entered into a credit agreement with a lending company and borrowed million and had repaid million by december  part of these proceeds were used to pay down higher interest bearing lines of credit 
we expect to have negative cash flows from operations for most of we also expect increased sales and marketing expenses related to the promotion of freestyle  increased research and development expenses  as well as expenses for additional personnel and product enhancement efforts 
our future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors  including market acceptance of freestyle  the resources we devote to developing and supporting our products  continued progress of our research and development of potential products  the need to acquire licenses to technology and the availability of other financing 
our capital expenditure for the year ended december  was million  and we believe that our capital expenditure for the next months will remain in line with our expenditure 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and investment balances  together with the revenue to be derived from sales of freestyle  will be sufficient to fund our operations until we become profitable 
to the extent our capital resources are insufficient to meet our future capital requirements  we would need to raise additional capital or incur additional indebtedness to fund our operations 
additional equity or debt financing  if required  may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to obtain additional capital  we may be required to reduce our selling and marketing activities for freestyle  delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate our research and development programs  or relinquish rights to technologies or products that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize 
in the event that we do raise additional equity financing  investors will be further diluted 
in the event we incur additional indebtedness to fund our operations  we may have to grant the lender a security interest in our assets

table of contents risk factors affecting operations and future results we have a history of net losses and variable quarterly results and may never achieve or maintain profitability 
we have incurred losses every year since we incurred losses of million in  million in and million in as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we will need to continue to increase product revenues and reduce product costs to achieve profitability 
we may be unable to do so  and therefore  may never achieve profitability 
even if we do achieve profitability  we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
as a relatively new entrant to the blood glucose monitoring market that has been experiencing rapid growth  revenues can vary from quarter to quarter due to various factors  including changes in customer stocking and inventory levels  the timing of promotions and price changes by us or our competitors  and new product introductions or enhancements by us or our competitors 
we maintain a limited inventory of finished goods and typically ship products within a short period after orders are received 
historically  customer buying patterns and our revenue growth have caused a substantial portion of our revenues to occur in the last month of the quarter 
delays in the receipt of orders or the manufacture of product near the end of the quarter could cause quarterly revenues to fall short of anticipated levels 
because our operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue levels and a high percentage of our expenses are relatively fixed  less than anticipated revenues for a quarter could have a significant adverse impact on our operating results 
we expect to derive substantially all of our future revenue from sales of freestyle and this product could fail to generate significant revenues 
currently  the primary products we market are the freestyle test strips  freestyle system kit and freestyle lancets  all of which we commercially introduced in june our freestyle products are expected to account for substantially all of our revenues for the next several years 
accordingly  our success depends upon the acceptance by people with diabetes  as well as health care providers and third party payors of freestyle as a preferred blood glucose self monitoring device 
relative to the overall size of the blood glucose monitoring market  a limited number of people have used freestyle  and people with diabetes or the medical community may not substantially endorse freestyle as a preferred blood glucose self monitoring device 
in addition  freestyle may not achieve significant market acceptance on a timely basis  if at all  due to the significant influence of established glucose monitoring products with healthcare professionals  customers and third party payors  the ability of some of our competitors to price products below a price at which we can competitively manufacture and sell our products  the introduction or acceptance of competing products or technologies  and cost constraints 
furthermore  freestyle may not encourage significantly more active testing  and participants in the glucose self monitoring market may gravitate toward more established brands 
if we are unable to successfully market and sell our freestyle products  we may not be able to generate significant revenues or achieve profitability because we do not have alternative products 
in addition  to encourage market acceptance of our products  we currently distribute the freestyle system kit at a financial loss through samples  discounts and rebates 
in order to generate sufficient revenues in the 
table of contents future  we will therefore have to rely on recurring revenue from the repeated purchase of our freestyle test strips 
if freestyle does not gain sufficient market share to generate significant recurring revenue from the sale of our test strips  we may not achieve profitability 
we have limited sales and marketing experience and any failure to expand sales of freestyle will negatively impact future revenues 
we have limited experience in marketing and selling our products relative to other companies in the blood glucose self monitoring market 
we received regulatory clearance for our initial product in january and commenced commercial shipments in june our products require a complex marketing and sales effort targeted at health care professionals  diabetes educators  people with diabetes  pharmacists and national retailers 
we have significantly expanded our sales and marketing teams in and we face significant challenges and risks in training  managing and retaining these teams  including managing geographically dispersed efforts 
in addition  we currently have only one distributor in most of europe and one distributor in japan 
we are dependent upon the sales and marketing efforts of our third party distributors in these large international markets 
these distributors may not commit the necessary resources to effectively market and sell our products 
further  they may not be successful in selling our products 
recently  the disetronic group  the parent company of our european distributor  announced that its insulin pump business will be acquired by roche diagnostics  one of our competitors 
while disetronic injections systems ag  our european distributor  will continue to distribute our products  we may not have the level of access to disetronic s insulin pump user base after the roche diagnostics acquisition that we enjoyed before the acquisition  and this could translate into decreased sales of our products 
in addition  the recent amendment to the international distributor agreement with disetronic lowered disetronic injection systems ag s annual minimum purchase obligations 
our financial condition would be harmed if our marketing and sales efforts are unsuccessful 
we face competition from competitors with greater resources  which may make it more difficult for us to achieve significant market penetration 
the market for blood glucose monitoring devices is intensely competitive  subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants 
we compete directly with roche diagnostics corporation  lifescan  inc  a division of johnson johnson  medisense  a division of abbott laboratories  and bayer ag  which currently account for approximately of the worldwide sales of blood glucose self monitoring systems 
in addition  becton  dickinson and company recently launched a new blood glucose monitoring system 
each of these companies is either publicly traded or a division of a publicly traded company  and they enjoy several competitive advantages  including significantly greater name recognition  established relations with health care professionals  customers and third party payors  additional lines of products  and the ability to offer rebates or bundle products to offer higher discounts or incentives to gain a competitive advantage  and greater resources for product development  sales and marketing  and patent litigation 
these companies and others have developed and will continue to develop and acquire new products that compete directly with our products 
in addition  our competitors spend significantly greater funds for the research  development  promotion and sale of new and existing products 
these resources can allow them to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
these resources also allow them to aggressively promote and discount their products  particularly system kits 
for all the foregoing reasons  we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors 
because the medical device industry is litigious  we may be sued for allegedly violating the intellectual property rights of others 
the medical technology industry has in the past been characterized by a substantial amount of litigation and related administrative proceedings regarding patents and intellectual property rights 
in addition  major medical 
table of contents device companies have used litigation against emerging growth companies as a means of gaining a competitive advantage 
should third parties file patent applications or be issued patents claiming technology also claimed by us in pending applications  we may be required to participate in interference proceedings in the us patent and trademark office to determine the relative priorities of our inventions and the third parties inventions 
we could also be required to participate in interference proceedings involving our issued patents and pending applications of another entity 
an adverse outcome in an interference proceeding could require us to cease using the technology or to license rights from prevailing third parties 
third parties may claim we are using their patented inventions and may go to court to stop us from engaging in our normal operations and activities 
these lawsuits are expensive to defend and conduct and would also consume and divert the time and attention of our management 
a court may decide that we are infringing a third party s patents and may order us to cease the infringing activity 
the court could also order us to pay damages for the infringement 
these damages could be substantial and could harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
in september  we received a letter from the exclusive licensee of an issued patent alleging that freestyle infringes the patent and requesting that we contact the licensee regarding sublicense opportunities 
we have evaluated the patent and we are discussing a possible sublicense with the licensee 
in august  we received a letter from the owner of an issued united states patent that states our freestyle tracker system may infringe the patent 
we are currently evaluating the patent owner s claims 
if we were unable to obtain  on reasonable commercial terms  any necessary license following a determination of infringement or an adverse determination in litigation or in interference or other administrative proceedings  we would have to redesign our products to avoid infringing a third party s patent and could temporarily or permanently have to discontinue manufacturing and selling some of our products 
if this were to occur  it would negatively impact future sales 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights  our competitors may take advantage of our ideas and compete directly against us 
we rely on patent protection  as well as a combination of copyright  trade secret and trademark laws  and nondisclosure  confidentiality agreements and other contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary technology 
however  these legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage 
for example  our patents may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented by third parties 
our patent applications may not be issued as patents in a form that will be advantageous to us 
we may not be able to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our technical knowledge or other trade secrets by employees 
furthermore  the laws of foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
even if our intellectual property rights are adequately protected  litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights  which could result in substantial costs to us and result in a substantial diversion of management attention 
if our intellectual property is not adequately protected  our competitors could use our intellectual property to enhance their products 
this would harm our competitive position  decrease our market share and otherwise harm our business 
the prosecution and enforcement of patents licensed to us by third parties are not within our control  and without these technologies  our products may not be successful and our business would be harmed 
we rely on licenses to use various technologies that are material to our business 
we do not own the patents that underlie these licenses 
the licenses from asulab  sa and inverness medical innovations  inc grant us the right under specific patents to make and sell diagnostic devices for diabetes monitoring that contain the inventions claimed in the licensed patents 
our rights to use these technologies and employ the inventions 
table of contents claimed in the licensed patents are subject to our licensors abiding by the terms of those licenses 
in addition  we often do not control the prosecution of the patents to which we hold licenses or the strategy for determining when any patents to which we hold licenses should be enforced 
as a result  we are largely dependent upon our licensors to determine the appropriate strategy for prosecuting and enforcing those patents 
if we are unable to continue to develop innovative products in the glucose monitoring market  our business would be harmed 
the glucose monitoring market is subject to rapid technological change and product innovations 
our products are based on our proprietary technology  but our competitors may succeed in developing or marketing products that will be technologically superior to ours or be more competitive with regard to product features 
in addition  over billion is spent annually on the treatment of diabetes and its complications and the national institutes for health and other supporters of diabetes research are continually seeking ways to prevent or cure diabetes 
therefore  our products may also be rendered obsolete by technological breakthroughs in diabetes prevention  monitoring or treatment 
we are currently developing additional enhancements for freestyle  and we are developing new products such as our continuous glucose monitoring system 
marketing of these products will require fda and other regulatory clearances and approvals 
we have experienced some delays in the clinical trials being conducted to support the approval of our continuous glucose monitoring system due to problems with the electronics portion of the system 
development of the continuous glucose monitoring system and other products will require additional research and development expenditures 
we may not be successful in developing  marketing or manufacturing these new products 
in addition  several of our competitors are in various stages of development of products similar to our continuous glucose monitoring system  and the fda has approved two of these products 
if any of our competitors succeeds in developing a commercially viable product for continuous glucose monitoring and obtains government approval or successfully commercializes its fda approved product  this could negatively affect our future revenues 
similarly  several of our competitors and some new market entrants are developing products that have small sample size requirements and the ability to test on the fingertip and other body sites 
a new competitor  for instance  recently launched a blood glucose monitoring system that claims the same sample size requirement as the freestyle blood glucose monitoring system 
the successful development and introduction of such products by competitors or new entrants would reduce the product benefits of our freestyle products versus the competition and could adversely impact future revenues 
if we fail to obtain or maintain necessary fda clearances or approvals for products  or if approvals are delayed  we will be unable to commercially distribute and market our products in the united states 
our products are medical devices that are subject to extensive regulation in the united states and in foreign countries where we do business 
unless an exemption applies  each medical device that we wish to market in the united states must first receive either k clearance or premarket approval from the fda 
either process can be lengthy and expensive 
the fda s k clearance process usually takes from four to twelve months from the date the application is complete  but may take longer 
although we have obtained k clearance for our initial product  freestyle  our k clearance can be revoked if safety or effectiveness problems develop 
the premarket approval process is much more costly  lengthy and uncertain 
it generally takes from one to three years from the date the application is complete or even longer 
however  achieving a completed application is a process that may take numerous clinical trials and require the filing of amendments over time 
therefore  even if a product is successfully developed  it may not be commercially available for a number of years 
our continuous glucose monitoring system under development will require premarket approval 
we have experienced some delays in the clinical trials being conducted to support the approval of our continuous glucose monitoring system due to problems with the electronics portion of the system 
we may not be able to obtain additional clearances or approvals for the continuous glucose monitoring system or other products in a timely fashion  or at all 
delays in obtaining clearance or approval could adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

table of contents modification to our marketed devices may require new k clearances or premarket approvals or require us to cease marketing or recall the modified devices until these clearances are obtained 
any modification to an fda cleared device that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness  or that would constitute a major change in its intended use  requires a new fda k clearance or possibly premarket approval 
the fda requires every manufacturer to make this determination in the first instance  but the fda can review any such decision 
we have modified aspects of freestyle since receiving regulatory approval  but we believe that new k clearances are not required 
in the case of certain labeling changes for freestyle  the fda required a new k clearance which was obtained in december we may make additional modifications to freestyle and future products after they have received clearance or approval  and in appropriate circumstances  determine that new clearance or approval is unnecessary 
the fda may not agree with any of our decisions not to seek new clearance or approval 
if the fda requires us to seek k clearance or premarket approval for any modifications to a previously cleared product  we may be required to cease marketing or recall the modified device until we obtain this clearance or approval 
also  in these circumstances  we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties 
if our suppliers or we fail to comply with the fda s quality system regulation  our manufacturing operations could be delayed  and our product sales and profitability could suffer 
our manufacturing processes for our freestyle test strips  as well as the manufacturing processes utilized by our suppliers of freestyle meters  lancing devices  lancets and control solution  are required to comply with the fda s quality system regulation  which covers the methods and documentation of the design  testing  production  control  quality assurance  labeling  packaging  storage and shipping of our products 
the fda enforces the quality system regulation through unannounced inspections 
the manufacturing lines for our freestyle meters at flextronics international ltd 
in san jose  california and china have not been inspected to date 
if we or one of our suppliers fail a quality system regulation inspection  our operations could be disrupted and our manufacturing delayed 
if we fail to take adequate corrective action in response to any fda observations  we could face various enforcement actions  which could include a shut down of our manufacturing operations and a recall of our products  which would harm our reputation and cause our product sales and profitability to suffer 
furthermore  our key component suppliers may not currently be or may not continue to be in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements 
our products are subject to product recalls or field corrective actions even after receiving fda clearance or approval  which would harm our reputation 
the fda and similar governmental authorities in other countries have the authority to require the recall of or field corrective actions for our products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture 
a government mandated or firm initiated recall or field corrective action by us could occur as a result of component failures  manufacturing errors or design defects 
we commenced a firm initiated field corrective action due to software bugs associated with the diabetes management features of our freestyle tracker diabetes management system shortly after its launch 
any recall of or material field corrective action for product may divert managerial and financial resources and harm our reputation with customers 
we currently depend on single suppliers and manufacturers for our freestyle products  and the loss of any of these suppliers or manufacturers could harm our business 
our freestyle meters  along with our freestyle lancing devices and lancets  are each currently manufactured according to our specifications by single third party manufacturers 
the meters  lancing devices and lancets are manufactured from components purchased from outside suppliers  and some of these components are currently single sourced 
we have previously experienced delays in the delivery of some sole sourced electronic components for our meters 
our freestyle test strips  which we manufacture ourselves  are comprised of several components obtained from single source suppliers 
in the event we are unable  for whatever reason  to obtain components from suppliers as scheduled  or if our contract manufacturers are unable to meet our 
table of contents manufacturing requirements  we may not be able to obtain components from alternate suppliers or engage an additional manufacturer in a timely manner 
any disruption or delay in shipments of freestyle meters  test strips  lancing devices or lancets could result in the loss of customers or the failure to acquire new customers  if they choose a competitor s product because our product is not available 
such a disruption or delay would negatively affect our revenues 
in addition  the purchase of components from alternate suppliers or engaging an additional manufacturer in a timely manner could impose increased costs that could negatively impact our gross margins 
if we are unable to meet customer demand  we may not improve our sales growth sufficiently to achieve profitability 
to be successful  we must manufacture our freestyle test strips in substantial quantities at acceptable costs 
if we do not succeed in manufacturing sufficient quantities of our test strips to meet customer demand  we could lose customers and fail to acquire new customers  if they choose a competitor s product because our product is not available 
increasing demand since the launch of freestyle has necessitated an increase in our test strip manufacturing capacity 
in response  we have expanded our manufacturing capacity at our facilities in alameda  california 
we anticipate the need to continue expanding manufacturing capacity and have ordered certain specialized equipment 
delays in receiving certain specialized equipment extended the date when we were able to begin operations on our second test strip line 
if we are unable to expand manufacturing capacity in a timely manner we could be unable to meet customer demand for freestyle test strips  which would adversely affect our financial results and restrict our sales growth 
significant product returns could harm our operating results 
our return policy allows end users in the united states and canada to return freestyle system kits to us for any reason for a full refund within days of purchase 
in addition  our freestyle system kits and freestyle test strips currently have an month shelf life 
retailers and wholesalers in the united states and canada can return these products to us within six months after this expiration date 
we have established reserves for the liability associated with product returns 
however  unforeseen returns from retailers  wholesalers or end users could adversely affect our operating results 
we may have warranty claims that exceed our reserves 
freestyle meters carry a five year warranty against defects in materials and workmanship 
we have established reserves for the liability associated with product warranties 
however  any unforeseen warranty exposure could adversely affect our operating results 
we outsource several key parts of our operations and any interruption in the services provided could prevent us from expanding our business 
we currently outsource several aspects of our business  including the manufacture of freestyle meters  lancing devices and lancets  the functioning of our procurement systems  the operation of our customer service function  and certain distribution and logistics functions 
since outsourcing leaves us without direct control over these business functions  interruptions in the services of our third party providers may be difficult or impossible to remedy in a timely fashion 
in addition  we may be unable to obtain the necessary resources from our third party providers to meet realized growth in our business 
any adverse changes in reimbursement procedures by medicare or other third party payors may limit our ability to market and sell our products 
in the united states  glucose self monitoring devices and test strips are generally covered by medicare and other third party payors  which provide for reimbursement of all or part of the cost of the product 
medicare and other third party payors are increasingly scrutinizing whether to cover new products and the level of 
table of contents reimbursement for covered products 
freestyle is currently being reimbursed through medicare  medicaid  open formulary plans and certain preferred provider organizations 
international market acceptance of our products will depend  in part  upon the availability of reimbursement within prevailing health care payment systems 
reimbursement and health care payment systems in international markets vary significantly by country  and include both government sponsored health care and private insurance 
we may not obtain international reimbursement approvals in a timely manner  if at all 
our failure to receive international reimbursement approvals may negatively impact market acceptance of our products in the international markets in which those approvals are sought 
we believe that in the future  reimbursement may be subject to increased restrictions both in the united states and in international markets 
third party reimbursement and coverage may not be available or adequate in either the united states or international markets 
future legislation  regulation or reimbursement policies of third party payors may adversely affect the demand for our existing products or our products currently under development or our ability to sell our products on a profitable basis 
the lack of third party payor coverage or the inadequacy of reimbursement could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may have difficulty managing our growth 
we have experienced significant growth in the scope of our operations and the number of our employees 
we expect this growth to continue though at substantially reduced rates 
this growth may continue to place a significant strain on our management and operations 
our ability to manage this growth will depend upon our ability to attract  hire and retain skilled employees 
our success will also depend on the ability of our officers and key employees to continue to implement and improve our operational and other systems  to manage multiple  concurrent development projects and to hire  train and manage our employees 
our future success is heavily dependent upon growth and acceptance of new products 
if we cannot scale our business appropriately or otherwise adapt to anticipated growth and new product introduction  our business  financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected 
our success will depend on our ability to attract and retain key personnel and scientific staff 
we believe our future success will depend upon our ability to successfully manage our growth  including attracting and retaining scientists  engineers and other highly skilled personnel 
our employees may terminate their employment with us at any time and are not subject to employment contracts 
hiring qualified management and technical personnel will be difficult due to the limited number of qualified professionals 
competition for these types of employees is intense in the field of diabetes monitoring and management 
we have in the past experienced difficulty in recruiting qualified personnel 
if we fail to attract and retain personnel  particularly management and technical personnel  we may not be able to execute on our business plan 
if we do not provide quality customer service  we would lose customers and our operating results would suffer 
our ability to provide superior customer service to our customers  health care professionals and educators is critical 
to effectively compete  we must build strong brand awareness among our customers  much of which is based upon personal referrals 
in order to gain these referrals  we must provide customer service representatives who are able and available to provide our customers with answers to questions regarding our products 
this will require us to continue to build and maintain customer service operations  for which we currently rely on a single third party provider 
we will require increased staff at our third party provider to further support growth in new customers 
any failures or disruption to our customer services operations  or the termination of our contract with our only third party provider  could cause us to lose customers 

table of contents our meters are manufactured in china  and we are subject to risks of international manufacturing operations 
our freestyle meters are manufactured according to our specifications by a single third party manufacturer at its facility in china 
the geographical distance between our principal facility in alameda  california and the manufacturing facility in china creates a number of logistical and communications challenges 
these challenges include managing operations across multiple time zones  directing the manufacture and delivery of products across distances  coordinating procurement and delivery of components and raw materials and coordinating the activities and decisions of the core manufacturing team  which is based in china and california 
governmental authorities in china exercise significant influence over many aspects of the economy  and their actions could have a significant effect on the manufacture of our freestyle meters 
risks of changes in economic and political conditions in china  include labor unrest and difficulties in staffing  increases in duties and taxation levied on our freestyle meters  limitations on imports of freestyle meter components or exports of assembled freestyle meters  or other travel restrictions  expropriation of private enterprises  a potential reversal of current favorable policies encouraging foreign trade  and fluctuations in the value of local currency 
any delay or disruption in the manufacture of our freestyle meters  including delays or disruptions relating to these logistical and communication challenges or changes in the economic or political conditions in china  could delay or disrupt shipments of freestyle meters to our customers 
shipment delays or disruptions could result in the loss of customers or the failure to acquire new customers  if they choose a competitor s product because our product is not available 
such a disruption or delay would negatively affect our revenues 
in addition  engaging an additional manufacturer or commencing freestyle meter manufacturing obligations on an alternative line in a timely manner could impose increased costs that would negatively impact our gross margins 
we are subject to additional risks associated with international operations 
we believe that a significant amount of our future revenues may come from international sales  and these sales are subject to a number of risks 
for example  foreign regulatory agencies often establish requirements different from those in the united states 
fluctuations in exchange rates of the us dollar against foreign currencies may affect demand for our products overseas 
in addition  our international sales may be adversely affected by export license requirements  the imposition of governmental controls  political and economic instability  trade restrictions  changes in tariffs and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations 
complying with international regulatory requirements is an expensive  time consuming process and approval is never certain 
international sales of our products are subject to strict regulatory requirements 
the review process varies from country to country  is typically lengthy and expensive  and approval is never certain 
we have the required regulatory approvals to market freestyle in various countries outside the united states 
failure to maintain current foreign approvals or to receive and maintain approvals in other countries would prevent us from expanding international sales of freestyle  which would negatively impact our future revenues 
if we choose to acquire new and complementary businesses  products or technologies instead of developing them ourselves  we may be unable to complete these acquisitions or to successfully integrate an acquired business or technology in a cost effective and non disruptive manner 
our success depends on our ability to continually enhance and broaden our product offerings in response to changing technologies  customer demands and competitive pressures 
accordingly  we may  in the future  
table of contents acquire complementary businesses  products  or technologies instead of developing them ourselves 
we do not know if we will be able to complete any acquisitions  or whether we will be able to successfully integrate any acquired business  operate it profitably or retain its key employees 
integrating any business  product or technology we acquire could be expensive and time consuming  disrupt our ongoing business and distract our management 
if we are unable to integrate any acquired entities  products or technologies effectively  our business will suffer 
in addition  any amortization of goodwill or other assets or charges resulting from the costs of acquisitions could harm our business and operating results 
if we become subject to product liability claims  we may be required to pay damages that exceed our insurance coverage 
our business exposes us to potential product liability claims that are inherent in the testing  production  marketing and sale of human diagnostic products 
while we believe that we are reasonably insured against these risks  we may not be able to obtain insurance in amounts or scope sufficient to provide us with adequate coverage against all potential liabilities 
currently  we maintain product liability insurance in the amount of million 
a product liability claim in excess of our insurance coverage would have to be paid out of cash reserves and would harm our reputation in the industry 
if we require future capital  we may not be able to secure additional funding in order to expand our operations and develop new products 
we may seek additional funds from public and private stock offerings  borrowings under lease lines of credit or other sources 
this additional financing may not be available on a timely basis on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
this financing may be dilutive to stockholders or may require us to grant a lender a security interest in our assets 
the amount of money we will need will depend on many factors  including revenues generated by sales of freestyle and our future products  expenses we incur in developing and selling our products  the commercial success of our research and development efforts  and the emergence of competing technological developments 
if adequate funds are not available  we may have to delay development or commercialization of our products or license to third parties the rights to commercialize products or technologies that we would otherwise seek to commercialize 
we also may have to reduce marketing  customer support or other resources devoted to our products 
any of these results would harm our financial condition 
most of our operations are currently conducted at a single location  and a disaster at this facility is possible and could result in a prolonged interruption of our business 
we currently conduct all our scientific and test strip manufacturing and most of our management activities at a single location in alameda  california near known earthquake fault zones 
in addition  our facilities were built on fill material dredged from the san francisco bay in the s 
we have taken precautions to safeguard our facilities  including insurance  health and safety protocols  and off site storage of computer data 
however  a natural disaster  such as an earthquake  fire or flood  could cause substantial delays in our operations  damage or destroy our manufacturing equipment or inventory  and cause us to incur additional expenses 
a disaster could seriously harm our business and adversely affect our reputation with customers 
the insurance we maintain against fires  floods  and earthquakes may not be adequate to cover our losses in any particular case 
we may be liable for contamination or other harm caused by materials that we use  and changes in environmental regulations could cause us to incur additional expense 
our research and development and clinical processes involve the use of potentially harmful biological materials as well as hazardous materials 
we are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations governing 
table of contents the use  handling  storage and disposal of hazardous and biological materials and we incur expenses relating to compliance with these laws and regulations 
if violations of environmental  health  and safety laws occur  we could be held liable for damages  penalties and costs of remedial actions 
these expenses or this liability could have a significant negative impact on our financial condition 
we may violate environmental  health and safety laws in the future as a result of human error  equipment failure  or other causes 
environmental laws could become more stringent over time  imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violations 
we are subject to potentially conflicting and changing regulatory agendas of political  business  and environmental groups 
changes to or restrictions on permitting requirements or processes  hazardous or biological material storage or handling might require an unplanned capital investment and or relocation 
compliance with new laws or regulations could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our common stock has been and will likely continue to be subject to substantial price and volume fluctuations  and the value of our stock could decline 
the market prices and trading volumes for emerging growth medical device companies and our company in particular have been highly volatile and are likely to continue to be highly volatile in the future 
the following factors  in addition to other risk factors described in this section  may have a significant impact on the market price of our stock volume and timing of orders for our products  monthly variations in market data relative to our competitors  our ability to develop  obtain regulatory clearance for  and market  new and enhanced products on a timely basis  the announcement of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors  announcements of technological or medical innovations in the monitoring or treatment of diabetes  product liability claims or other litigation  quarterly variations in our or our competitors results of operations  changes in governmental regulations or in the status of our regulatory approvals or applications  changes in the availability of third party reimbursement in the united states or other countries  changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts  and general market conditions and other factors  including factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors 
the sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may adversely affect the market price for our common stock sales of a significant number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the market perception that these sales may occur  could negatively affect the market price for our common stock 
as of march   we had  shares of common stock outstanding 
all of these shares are available for sale 
also  many of our employees  consultants and directors may exercise their stock options in order to sell the stock underlying their options in the market under a registration statement we have filed with the sec 
our executive officers and directors and entities affiliated with them own a significant percentage of our stock  and as a result  the trading price for our shares may be depressed and these stockholders can take actions that may be adverse to investors interests 
our executive officers and directors and entities affiliated with them beneficially own  in the aggregate  approximately of our common stock as of march  this significant concentration of share ownership 
table of contents may adversely affect the trading price for our common stock because investors often perceive disadvantages in owning stock in companies with concentrated ownership 
these stockholders  acting together  will have the ability to exert substantial influence over all matters requiring approval by our stockholders  including the election and removal of directors and any proposed merger  consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets 
in addition  they could dictate the management of our business and affairs 
this concentration of ownership could have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control  or impeding a merger or consolidation  takeover or other business combination that could be favorable to our investors 
our stockholder rights plan  charter documents and delaware law may inhibit a takeover that stockholders consider favorable and could also limit the market price of investors stock 
in february  our board of directors adopted a stockholder rights plan 
the stockholder rights plan provides for a dividend distribution of one preferred shares purchase right on each outstanding share of our common stock 
each right entitles stockholders to buy th of a share of the company s series a participating preferred stock at an exercise price of

section of delaware general corporate law  our stockholder rights plan and other provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and under delaware law could reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock in the future and result in the market price being lower than it would be without these provisions 
the liquidity of our common stock is uncertain since it has been publicly traded for a short period of time and may have a limited market 
prior to our initial public offering in october  there was no public market for our common stock 
we cannot predict the extent to which investor interest in our company will lead to the development of an active  liquid trading market 
active trading markets generally result in lower price volatility and more efficient execution of buy and sell orders for investors 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk because we translate foreign currencies into united states dollars for reporting purposes  exchange rates can have an impact on our financial results  although this impact is generally immaterial 
we believe that our exposure to currency exchange risk is low because our canadian and united kingdom subsidiaries satisfy their financial obligations almost exclusively in their local currencies 
as of december   we did not engage in foreign currency hedging activities 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our invested cash without significantly increasing risk of loss 
as of december   our cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities consisted primarily of money market funds maintained at three major us financial institutions 
the recorded carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents approximate fair value due to their short term maturities 
we do not believe that an increase in market rates would have any significant negative impact on the realized value of our investments  but an increase in market rates could negatively impact the interest expense associated with a portion of our long term debt 
substantially all of our long term debt obligations have a fixed rate of interest
