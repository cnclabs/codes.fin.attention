item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview abaxis  inc us or we  incorporated in california in  develops  manufactures and markets portable blood analysis systems for use in any veterinary or human patient care setting to provide clinicians with rapid blood constituent measurements 
our primary product is a system consisting of a compact kilogram analyzer and a series of single use plastic discs  called reagent discs  containing all the chemicals required to perform a panel of up to tests 
the system can be operated with minimal training and performs multiple routine tests on whole blood  serum or plasma samples 
the system provides test results in less than minutes with the precision and accuracy equivalent to a clinical laboratory analyzer 
we currently market this system for veterinary use under the name vetscan and in the human medical market under the name piccolo 
we also market a hematology analyzer under the name vetscan hmt  which provides a complete blood count cbc including three part white blood cell wbc differential in less than minutes and requires only l microliter of whole blood 
it provides results for eight selectable species  plus two user configurable programs 
we market one type of reagent kit with this analyzer 
we purchase the hematology analyzer and reagent kits from melet schloesing laboratories of france 
we are not obligated to purchase a minimum amount of analyzers or reagent kits 
we market the combination of the vetscan and the vetscan hmt under the name vetscan dxs 
in the fiscal year ended march   our domestic revenues accounted for of our total revenues versus in the fiscal year ended march   and international revenues accounted for in the fiscal year ended march  versus in the fiscal year ended march  the primary reasons for the increase in international revenues and commensurate decrease in domestic revenues as a percentage of total revenues in the fiscal year ended march  were the favorable exchange rates on sales outside of the us and that we signed a new exclusive distribution partnership for japan with t 
chatani and co 
sales for any future periods are not predictable with a significant degree of certainty 
we generally operate with limited order backlog because our products typically are shipped shortly after orders are received 
as a result  product sales in any quarter are generally dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
our expense levels  which are to a large extent fixed  are based in part on our expectations of future revenues 
accordingly  we may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall 
as a result  any such shortfall would negatively affect our operating results and financial condition 
our sales may be adversely impacted by pricing pressure from competitors 
our ability to be consistently profitable will depend  in part  on our ability to increase our sales volumes of our vetscan dxs and piccolo products and to compete with other competitors successfully 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful 
we introduced our vetscan canine heartworm antigen test in december the test is a stand alone lateral flow device similar in format to simple pregnancy tests 
results are available in a maximum of minutes 
we purchased the vetscan canine heartworm antigen test from sa scientific  inc  of san antonio  texas  a privately held leader in the development and manufacturing of a wide range of one step rapid tests for various diseases 
the addition of the vetscan canine heartworm antigen test expanded our product lines in the veterinary market 
however  in march  idexx laboratories  inc  our principal competitor in the veterinary market  filed a patent infringement 
table of contents lawsuit against both sa scientific and us 
on december   we and sa scientific  inc entered into a settlement agreement with idexx under which  among other terms  abaxis paid idexx  in cash damages and ceased the selling of the particular canine heartworm antigen test referenced in the complaint 
we are exploring whether or not we will introduce another canine heartworm antigen test in the near future  although there can be no assurance that we would be successful in any such efforts or that any party will not claim patent infringement on us or file suit upon other grounds 
we continue to explore the application of our proprietary technology used to produce the dry reagents used in the reagent discs  called the orbos discrete lyophilization process  to other companies products 
this process allows the production of an accurate  precise amount of active chemical ingredients in the form of a soluble bead 
we believe that the orbos process has broad applications in products where delivery of active ingredients in a stable  pre metered format is desired 
we have contracts with becton dickinson immunocytometry systems and amersham biosciences corp 
formerly pharmacia biotech  inc to either supply products or license orbos technology 
revenues from these agreements  however  is unpredictable 
we are currently working with other companies to determine the potential suitability of the orbos technology to these companies products 
as resources permit  we will pursue other development  licensing or manufacturing agreement opportunities for our orbos technology with other companies 
there can be no assurances  however  that other applications will be identified or that additional agreements with us will result 
results of operations total revenues during the fiscal year ended march   we reported total revenues of  a  or increase from the fiscal year ended march  total revenues of  the increase in revenues in the fiscal year ended march  compared to the fiscal year ended march  were driven by increased unit sales of reagent discs in the us and europe  increased instrument placements in asia  europe and latin america  increased instrument placements and reagent discs sold to the military  offset by a decrease in instrument placements in the us excluding sales to the military and a decrease in other sales in the us 
in the fiscal year ended march   we ceased selling the vetscan canine heartworm test 
our revenues in the fiscal year ended march  increased  or from the fiscal year ended march  total revenues of  the increase in revenues in the fiscal year ended march  compared to the fiscal year ended march  were due to increased unit sales of reagent discs in the us and europe  increased orbos sales and sales of our vetscan canine heartworm antigen test introduced in december  offset by decreases in unit sales of vetscan dxs 
total revenues in the us for the fiscal year ended march  were  a  or increase from the fiscal year ended march  of  the net increase in the us in the fiscal year ended march  compared to the fiscal year ended march  was attributed to increases of  in total instrument placements and reagent discs sold to the military   of unit sales of reagent discs sold to all other customers excluding the military and  from development and licensing revenue  offset by decreases of  in instrument placements to all other customers excluding the military and  in other sales 
total revenues in the us for the fiscal year ended march  were  a  or increase from the fiscal year ended march  of  total revenues in europe for the fiscal year ended march  were  a  or increase from the fiscal year ended march  of approximately  the increase in europe in the fiscal year ended march  compared to the fiscal year ended march  was attributed to increases of  in instrument placements and  of reagent discs sold 
total revenues in europe for the fiscal year ended march  were  a  or increase from the fiscal year ended march  of  total revenues in asia and latin america for the fiscal year ended march  were  a  or increase from the fiscal year ended march  of  the net increase in revenue in asia and latin america in the fiscal year ended march  compared to march  was attributed to an increase of  in instrument sales  offset by a decrease of  in reagent discs sales 
the revenues from asia and latin america increased in the fiscal year ended march  as a result of favorable exchange rates on sales outside of the us and also  we signed a new exclusive distribution partnership for japan with t 
chatani and co 
total revenues in asia and latin america were  a  or decrease from the fiscal year ended march  of

other sales included a decrease of  in orbos sales and an increase of  in sales from the vetscan canine heartworm test  which we ceased selling in december as a result of an out of court settlement 
total sales of the canine heartworm test in the fiscal year ended march  were  net product sales for the fiscal year ended march  increased  or from the fiscal year ended march  of  the change in net product sales was due to a decrease of  in instrument sales  an increase of  in reagent sales and an increase of  in other sales  most of which was due to sales from the vetscan canine heartworm test of  and an increase of  in orbos sales 
most of the increased sales in the fiscal year ended march  occurred in the us 
our instrument and reagent sales accounted for and  respectively  of our product sales in the fiscal year ended march  compared to and  respectively  of our product sales in the fiscal year ended march  during the fiscal year ended march   we sold  instruments  which includes both blood chemistry and hematology analyzers  compared with  instruments sold in the fiscal year ended march  the increase in instrument sales reflects increased unit shipments in both the domestic and international markets 
our goal for the fiscal year ending march  is to continue the increase in instrument sales by allocating resources to product selling and marketing 
we intend to introduce marketing programs emphasizing instrument sales 
we also plan to increase our sales force and offer incentives programs to retain highly skilled sales professionals 
reagent discs sold during the fiscal year ended march  were approximately  an increase of compared to approximately  reagent discs in the fiscal year ended march  approximately of these reagent discs were for veterinary applications 
the increase in reagent disc sold during our fiscal year ended march  compared to the fiscal year ended march  is consistent with our belief that there will be recurring reagent disc revenue as our product lines mature 
this growth is mostly attributable to the expanded installed base of vetscan dxs and higher consumption rates of institutional users 
development and licensing revenue we receive royalty payments from amersham biosciences formerly pharmacia biotech equal to of net sales  as defined in our agreement  of amersham s products that use our technology 
during the fiscal year ended march   we reported development and licensing revenue of  a  or increase from  in the fiscal year ended march  development and licensing revenue in the fiscal year ended march  decreased  or from  in the fiscal year ended march  the fluctuations in development and licensing revenue during fiscal years ended march   and are due to changes in our customers use of our orbos technology 
such fluctuations are unpredictable 
cost of product sales cost of product sales for the fiscal year ended march  was  or of product sales  as compared to  or of product sales in the fiscal year ended march  in the fiscal year ended march   cost of product sales was  or of product sales 
the decrease in cost of product sales as a percent of revenue for the fiscal year ended march  as compared to the fiscal year ended march  and fiscal year ended march  as compared to fiscal year ended march  were primarily attributable to continued increases in sales volume of reagent discs and lower unit costs resulting from improved manufacturing processes and absorption of fixed costs of our current facilities 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expenses were  or of total revenues in the fiscal year ended march  compared to  or of total revenues in the fiscal year ended march   and 
table of contents  or of total revenues in the fiscal year ended march  the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses of  or in the fiscal year ended march   compared to the fiscal year ended march   was primarily due to increased expenses of  devoted to sales and marketing resources in the human medical market and  of costs related to legal action filed by idexx 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses of  or in the fiscal year ended march   compared to the fiscal year ended march   was primarily due to one time charges of  incurred in our fiscal year ended march  associated with the relocation to new facilities 
research and development expense we incurred research and development expenses of  in the fiscal year ended march  compared with  in the fiscal year ended march  and  in the fiscal year ended march  the  or increase in research and development expenses in the fiscal year ended march  compared to the fiscal year ended march  was primarily related to the completion of clinical trials and food and drug administration fda clearance on our lipid panel for use in the piccolo diagnostic system and completion of the vetscan comprehensive diagnostic profile rotor for use in the veterinary market 
the  or increase in research and development expenses in the fiscal year ended march  compared to the fiscal year ended march  was primarily due to increases in pre clinical testing and clinical trials of new test methods  configuration of rotors and other project developments 
research and development activities accounted for of total revenues during the fiscal year ended march  as compared to of total revenues during the fiscal year ended march  and during the fiscal year ended march  we anticipate the dollar amount of research and development expenses to increase in the fiscal year ending march  from the fiscal year ended march  but remain consistent as a percentage of total revenues  as we complete development and clinical trials of the renal function  hepatic function and comprehensive metabolic tests in the human medical market 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will undertake such research and development activities in future periods or  if we do  that such activities will be successful 
interest and other income interest and other income totaled  in the fiscal year ended march  compared to  in the fiscal year ended march  and  in the fiscal year ended march  interest and other income  for the fiscal year ended march   primarily consisted of  from interest earned on cash and cash equivalents 
interest and other income  for the fiscal year ended march   included approximately  of interest received from our reagent rental program and  from interest earned on cash and cash equivalents 
the increase in the fiscal year ended march   compared to the fiscal year ended march  is primarily due to a higher average balance of cash and cash equivalents 
interest and other expense interest and other expense totaled  in the fiscal year ended march  compared to  in the fiscal year ended march  and  in the fiscal year ended march  interest and other expense for the fiscal year ended march   included approximately  of interest on our capital equipment loan and line of credit   on our capital leases and  on our co promotion agreement with abbott laboratories 
no interest was capitalized during the period 
during the fiscal year ended march   we incurred interest expense of  on equipment and working capital loans and totaling  on our building and capital leases  net of capitalized interest of  on the purchase and installation of our semi automated disc production line 
also included in interest expense  in the fiscal year ended march   was a cancellation fee of  related to the termination of our previous equipment and working capital loans when we signed our new agreements with comerica bank california in march we incurred other expense of  for currency losses during our fiscal year ended march  income tax provision income tax provision totaled an expense of   and  for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively

we anticipate to incur incremental additional costs to support our future operations  including further commercialization of our products and development of new test methods that will allow us to expand our veterinary market and further penetrate the human diagnostic market  acquisition of capital equipment for our manufacturing facilities  which includes the ongoing costs related to continuing development of our current and future products  and additional pre clinical testing and clinical trials for our current and future products 
we anticipate that our existing capital resources  debt financing  and anticipated revenue from the sales of our products will be adequate to satisfy our currently planned operating and financial requirements through the next twelve months 
our future capital requirements will largely depend upon the increased market acceptance of our point of care blood analyzer products 
however  our sales for any future periods are not predictable with a significant degree of certainty 
net cash provided by operating activities in the fiscal year ended march  was  compared to  in the fiscal year ended march  and net cash used in operating activities of  in the fiscal year ended march  net cash provided by operating activities in the fiscal year ended march  was due primarily to an increase of  in net income and decreases totaling  resulting from changes in inventories and increases totaling  in accounts payable  accrued payroll and related expenses and deferred rent 
the decrease in inventory was due to lower inventory levels as of march  resulting from better inventory management 
the increase in accrued payroll and related expenses is primarily due to an increase in our headcount during the fiscal year ended march  these sources of cash were partially offset by increases totaling  in trade receivables  prepaid expenses  deposits and other assets and decreases totaling  in warranty reserve  other accrued liabilities  deferred revenue and long term commission obligations

the decrease in trade receivables was attributable to lower outstanding days of sales in receivables as a result of better collections 
the decrease in inventory was due to lower inventory levels at the fiscal year ended march  resulting from better inventory management 
our inventory level at the beginning of the fiscal year ended march  was relatively high compared to market demands

the common stock warrants are valid for five years and exercisable at per share 
approximately  of the aggregate proceeds were attributed to the value of the warrants and allocated to common stock 
the fair value of the warrants was determined using the black scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions contractual life of five years  volatility of  risk free interest rate of and no dividends during the contractual term 
in connection with the sale of the series e preferred we issued to advisors for services a fully vested warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share and  shares of common stock 
the aggregate value of the warrant and shares of our common stock of  was recorded as a stock issuance cost 
the value of the warrants was determined using the black scholes option pricing model with assumptions substantially consistent with those used for valuing the warrants issued to the investors

 accounting for convertible securities with beneficial conversion features of contingently adjustable conversion ratios  to certain convertible securities  the allocated value of the series e convertible preferred stock contained a beneficial conversion feature calculated based on the difference between the effective conversion price of the proceeds allocated to the series e convertible preferred stock and the fair market value of the common stock at the date of issuance 
accordingly  we determined an aggregate dividend charge of  representing the value of the beneficial conversion feature 
the amounts recorded in our financial statements during the fiscal year ended march   representing the amounts attributed to the closings in april  were as follows net cash proceeds   of issuance costs incurred  allocation to warrants issued to investors  warrants issued to advisors for services  and the amount of the dividend charge related to the beneficial conversion feature line of credit and long term debt in march  we terminated certain line of credit and equipment financing loans and entered into new line of credit and equipment financing loans with comerica bank california 
the new line of credit provides for borrowings of up to  based on our outstanding accounts receivables and inventory  as defined by the bank up to  is collateralized by domestic receivables and up to  is collateralized by foreign receivables 
this new line of credit bears interest at the prime rate  which was at march   and is payable monthly

critical accounting policies we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed below 
for a more detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see the notes to financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition revenues from product sales  net of estimated sales allowances and rebates  are generally recognized upon shipment when a purchase order has been received  the sales price is fixed and determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
rights of return are generally not provided and provisions are made at the time the related revenue is recognized for the estimated future costs to be incurred under initial standard warranty obligations of one year 
revenues received for  or allocated to extended warranty arrangements are recognized ratably over the related warranty period 
instrument revenues under cross distribution agreements where we and another party purchase each other s products for resale are recognized upon sale of the products to the end user 
development and licensing revenue is recognized in accordance with the related contract terms 
we make estimates to adjust revenues for estimated sales allowances and rebates based on historical data and terms of current promotions  including cash rebates and trade in programs in which we issue credit to customers as incentives for purchasing our products 
although we believe these estimates are reliable  it is possible that actual allowance or rebate amounts realized could vary from our estimates and that the amounts of such differences could affect our operating results 
reserves and accruals we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts based on our assessment of the collectibility of amounts owed us by customers which is mostly determined by the customer s payment history and the outstanding period of accounts 
in addition  we provide provisions for the estimated future costs to be incurred under our standard warranty obligations of one year 
actual amounts realized could vary from our estimates and affect our operating results 

table of contents income taxes we have substantial deferred tax assets that relate primarily to prior period losses 
we evaluate these deferred tax assets by estimating the likelihood of our generating future profits to realize these assets 
at march   we had approximately million of net deferred tax assets 
if these estimates and assumptions change in the future  or should we generate taxable income  we may be able to reverse all or a portion of the valuation allowances 
a valuation allowance has been established to fully reserve these deferred tax assets due to uncertainty regarding their realizability 
contractual obligations as of march   we have the following outstanding contractual obligations in september  we entered into a co promotion agreement with abbott laboratories 
the agreement was for an initial term of two years 
as of september   the co promotion agreement with abbott laboratories was terminated in accordance with its terms 
while this agreement was in effect  we incurred commission obligations to abbott laboratories totaling  at march   payable over an approximate five year period 
the present value of such obligations were recorded concurrent with the respective sales using a discount rate of 
there was no outstanding balance on our line of credit  which is payable upon demand  at march  future principal payments on an equipment financing loan at march  are as follows fiscal year ending march  the future minimum payments under capital and operating leases at march  are as follows capital operating leases leases fiscal year ending march  thereafter total minimum lease payments less amounts representing interest to present value of minimum lease payments less amounts due within one year long term portion in connection with our facility lease agreement  we have established a letter of credit for  which is secured by our line of credit 
purchase commitments 
table of contents we have entered into a non cancelable purchase commitment with one of our suppliers 
the outstanding commitment as of march  was approximately  in november  we arrived at general terms with sa scientific  inc  of san antonio  texas  to purchase canine heartworm antigen tests over a period of four years 
in december  we reached an out of court settlement with one of our competitors  idexx laboratories  inc  which alleged in an action filed with the united states district court for the district court of maine that the canine heartworm antigen test supplied to us by sa scientific infringed on two of idexx s patents 
in light of the terms of this settlement  we do not believe  based on the general terms that we have agreed to with sa scientific  that we will be obligated to purchase any of the canine heartworm antigen tests 
we and sa scientific are currently renegotiating our commercial relationship 
contingencies we are involved in various litigation matters in the normal course of business 
we believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
on march   idexx laboratories  inc  our principal competitor in the veterinary diagnostic market  filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of maine civil action docket no 
p h alleging that a canine heartworm test produced for us by a third party  sa scientific  inc  and sold using the abaxis brand infringed on us patents nos 
 and  held by idexx 
on december   we and sa scientific entered into a settlement agreement with idexx under which  among other terms  we paid idexx  in cash damages and ceased selling the particular canine heartworm antigen test referenced in the complaint 
we are exploring whether or not we will introduce another canine heartworm antigen test in the near future and there can be no assurance that any party will not claim patent infringement or file suit upon other grounds 
we would incur expenses in the defense of such claims and our attention could be diverted from our operations 
new accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of and addresses the financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we adopted sfas no 
effective april  the adoption did not have a significant impact on our financial position or result of operations 
there was no effect in the financial statements upon adoption 
in june  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which addresses accounting for restructuring and similar costs 
sfas supersedes previous accounting guidance  principally emerging issues task force issue no 
we will adopt the provisions of sfas for restructuring activities initiated after december  sfas requires that the liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under issue  a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of our commitment to an exit plan 
sfas also establishes that the liability should initially be measured and recorded at fair value 
accordingly  sfas may affect the timing of recognizing future restructuring costs as well as the amounts recognized 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
amends fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas amends the disclosure requirements of sfas to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements of the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we adopted the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
on january  we do not expect to change to using the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation  and therefore  adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have an impact on the financial position  results of operations or cash flows in the financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin requires a liability to be recognized at the time a company issues a guarantee for the fair value of the obligations assumed under certain guarantee agreements 
additional disclosures about guarantee agreements are also required in the interim and 
table of contents annual financial statements  including a roll forward of the entity s product warranty liabilities 
the disclosure provisions of fin are effective during the fourth quarter of fiscal the provisions for initial recognition and measurement of guarantee agreements are effective on a prospective basis for guarantees that are issued or modified after december  we do not expect that the recognition provisions of fin will have a material impact upon our financial statements 
risk factors that may affect our performance our future performance is subject to a number of risks 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business could be harmed and the trading price of our common stock could decline 
when used in these risk factors  the words anticipates  believes  expects  intends  plans  future  and similar expressions identify forward looking statements 
our actual results could differ materially from those that we project in the forward looking statements as a result of factors that we have set forth throughout this document as well as factors of which we are currently not aware 
we are not consistently profitable  we must increase sales of our piccolo and vetscan dxs products to maintain consistent profitability we recognized a net loss in two of the last twelve fiscal quarters ended march  after accounting for dividend charges associated with the issuance of our preferred stock and non cash charges related to the beneficial conversion feature contained in the preferred stock  we recognized a net loss in six of those quarters 
there can be no assurance that we will experience profitability in the future 
as of march   we have incurred cumulative net losses of approximately million 
our ability to be consistently profitable will depend  in part  on our ability to increase our sales volumes of our vetscan dxs and piccolo products 
increasing our sales volume of our products will depend upon our ability to continue to develop our products  increase our sales and marketing activities  increase our manufacturing activities  and effectively compete against current and future competitors 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully increase our sales volumes of our products to achieve sustained profitability 
we are not able to predict sales in future quarters and a number of factors affect our periodic results we are not able to accurately predict our sales in future quarters 
in any quarter  we derive almost one half of our revenues from two distributors who resell our products to the ultimate user 
while we are better able to predict sales of our reagent discs  as we sell these discs primarily for use with analyzers that we sold in prior periods  we generally are unable to predict with much certainty sales of our analyzers  as we typically sell our analyzers to new users 
accordingly  our sales in any one quarter are not indicative of our sales in any future period 
in addition  we generally operate with limited order backlog  because we ship our products shortly after we receive the orders from our customers 
as a result  our product sales in any quarter are generally dependent on orders that we receive and ship in that quarter 
we base our expense levels  which are to a large extent fixed  in part on our expectations as to future revenues 
we may be unable to reduce our spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall 
as a result  any such shortfall would immediately materially and adversely impact our operating results and financial condition 
in addition  we have historically experienced a decrease in our sales  especially in europe  in our second and third quarters  ending in september and december of each year  which we believe is due to seasonal patterns in the decision making processes to acquire our products 
accordingly  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful 
our periodic operating results have varied in the past 
in the future  we anticipate our periodic operating results to vary significantly depending on  but not limited to  a number of factors  including  in addition to those factors discussed elsewhere in this section 
table of contents new product announcements made by us or our competitors  changes in our pricing structures or the pricing structures of our competitors  our ability to develop  introduce and market new products on a timely basis  our manufacturing capacities and our ability to increase the scale of these capacities  the mix of product sales between our analyzer and our reagent disc products  the amount we spend on research and development  and changes in our strategy 
we could fail to achieve anticipated revenue if the market does not accept our products our core compact blood analyzer product differs substantially from current blood analyzers on the market 
our primary competition is from centralized laboratories that offer a greater number of tests than our products  but do so at greater cost and requiring more time 
we also compete with other point of care analyzers that cost more  require more maintenance and offer a narrower range of tests 
however  these point of care analyzers are generally marketed by larger companies which have greater resources for sales and marketing  in addition to a recognized brand name and established relationships 
historically we have marketed our vetscan analyzer to veterinarians and we have limited experience in large scale sales of our piccolo analyzer into the human market 
we continue to develop new animal blood tests that we cannot be assured will be accepted by the veterinarian market 
although we believe that our blood analyzers offer consumers many advantages  including according to our analyses substantial cost savings  in terms of the actual product and implementation of it procedurally  these advantages involve changes to current standard practices  such as using large clinical laboratories  that will require changes in both the procedures and mindset of care providers 
the human medical market in particular is highly regulated  structured and often slow to change 
if we are unable to convince large numbers of medical clinics  hospitals and other points of care of the benefits of our products  we will suffer lost sales and could fail to achieve anticipated revenue 
we are dependent upon our profitability  and if we cannot remain profitable we may need additional funding in the future and these funds may not be available to us we believe that our existing capital resources  bank and equipment financing loans and anticipated revenue from the sales of our products will be adequate to satisfy our currently planned operating and financial requirements through march   although no assurances can be given 
our bank financing documents contain a number of covenants concerning financial tests that we must meet that are more fully detailed in the agreements that we have filed with the sec as exhibits to our periodic reports 
we may need additional funds if we are unable to meet requirements for continuing access to bank financing or if we do not achieve anticipated revenues from the sale of our piccolo and vetscan dxs products 
further  we anticipate to incur incremental additional costs to support our future operations  including further commercialization of our products and development of new test methods to allow us to further penetrate the human diagnostic market and the veterinary diagnostic market  our need to acquire capital equipment for our manufacturing facilities  which includes the ongoing implementation of our semi automated manufacturing lines to provide capacity for the production of commercial volumes of our products  research and design costs related to the continuing development of our current and future products  and additional pre clinical testing and clinical trials for our current and future products 
to the extent that our existing resources and anticipated revenue from the sale of our products are insufficient to fund our activities or if we are unable to meet the financial tests contained in our bank financing documents  we may 
table of contents have to raise additional funds from the issuance of public or private securities 
in the event that we cannot maintain compliance with the financial covenants of our bank financing agreements  we may also be subject to increased interest rate expenses 
we may not be able to raise additional funding  or if we are able to  we may not be able to raise funding on acceptable terms 
we may also dilute then existing shareholders if we raise additional funds by issuing new equity securities 
alternately  we may have to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies  products and or sales territories if we are required to obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners 
if we are unable to raise needed funds  we may be required to curtail our operations significantly 
this would materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
we recently settled a patent infringement lawsuit and we could be the subject of similar legal action in the future on march   idexx laboratories  inc  our principal competitor in the veterinary diagnostic market  filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of maine civil action docket no 
p h alleging that a canine heartworm test produced for us by a third party  sa scientific  inc  and sold using the abaxis brand infringed on us patents nos 
 and  held by idexx 
on december   the parties entered into a settlement agreement under which  among other terms  we paid idexx  in cash damages and we ceased the selling the particular canine heartworm antigen test referenced in the complaint 
we are exploring whether we will introduce another canine heartworm antigen test in the near future and there can be no assurance that any party will not claim patent infringement or file suit upon other grounds 
we would incur expenses in the defense of such claims and our attention could be diverted from our operations 
we rely on patents and other proprietary information  the loss of any of which would negatively affect our business as of march   we have filed patent applications in the united states  of which have been issued 
additionally  we have filed several international patent applications covering the same subject matter as our domestic applications 
the patent position of any medical device manufacturer  including abaxis  is uncertain and may involve complex legal and factual issues 
consequently  we may not be issued any additional patents  either domestically or internationally 
furthermore  our patents may not provide significant proprietary protection because there is a chance that they will be circumvented or invalidated 
we cannot be certain that we were the first creator of the inventions covered by our issued patents or pending patent applications  or that we were the first to file patent applications for these inventions  because the united states patent and trademark office maintains all patent applications in secrecy until it issues the patents and publications of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature tend to lag behind actual discoveries by several months 
we may have to participate in interference proceedings  which are proceedings in front of the us patent and trademark office  to determine who will be issued a patent 
these proceedings could be costly and could be decided against us 
we also rely upon copyrights  trademarks and unpatented trade secrets 
others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques that would undermine our proprietary technologies 
further  others may gain access to our trade secrets or disclose such technology 
although we require our employees  consultants and advisors to execute agreements that require that our corporate information be kept confidential and that any inventions by these individuals are property of abaxis  there can be no assurance that these agreements will provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies for our trade secrets in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information 
the unauthorized dissemination of our confidential information would negatively impact our business 
we continue to develop our marketing and distribution experience in the human market and have limited resources to devote to such efforts although we have gained experience marketing our vetscan system products for the past seven years in the veterinary diagnostic market  we have much less experience in marketing the piccolo system in the human diagnostic market 
accordingly  we have limited sales  marketing and distribution experience  especially in the human diagnostic market 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to establish and maintain effective distribution arrangements in the human market  any distribution arrangements that we are able to establish will be successful in marketing our products  or 
table of contents the costs associated with marketing and distributing our products will not be excessive 
should we fail to effectively develop our marketing and distribution efforts  our growth will be limited and our results of operations will be adversely affected 
many of our sales force have been employed by us for less than one year and we must effectively train and integrate our sales team in order to achieve our anticipated revenue we have thirty full time sales personnel involved in our sales and marketing activities  many of whom have been employed by us for a limited period of time 
while these individuals work with our distribution partners both domestically and internationally to extend our market reach  the primary selling activities are often done by these individuals 
if we are to increase our sales  we will need to train new salespeople and supervise them closely 
we also will continue hiring additional sales personnel 
if we are unable to retain our existing personnel  or attract and train additional qualified personnel  our growth may be limited due to our lack of capacity to market our products 
we need to successfully manufacture and market additional  recently approved reagent discs for the human diagnostic market if we are to compete in that market we have developed a blood analysis system that consists of a portable blood analyzer and single use reagent discs 
each reagent disc performs a series of standard blood tests 
we believe that it is necessary to develop additional series of reagent discs with various tests for use with the piccolo and vetscan dxs 
historically  we primarily developed reagent discs suitable for the veterinary diagnostic market 
we recently received approval from the us food and drug administration to begin selling additional tests  namely hdl and triglycerides  for the more lucrative human diagnostic market 
these tests are included in standard tests for which the medical community receives reimbursements from third party payors such as hmos and medicare 
we may not be able to successfully manufacture or market these newly developed reagent discs 
our failure to meet these challenges will materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
we rely on distributors to sell our products  we rely on sole distributor arrangements in a number of countries we distribute our products primarily through distributors 
as a result  we are dependent upon these distributors to sell our products and to assist us in promoting and creating a demand for our products 
we have a number of distributors in the united states who distribute our vetscan dxs products 
two distributors  vedco inc and dvm resources accounted for and  respectively  of total revenues for the fiscal year ended march   and  respectively  of total revenues for the fiscal year ended march  and and  respectively  of total revenues for the fiscal year ended march  we believe that our future growth depends on the efforts of these distributors 
if one of our distributors  particularly vedco  inc  were to stop selling our products we may not be able to replace such lost revenue 
we operate on a purchase order basis with vedco  inc and dvm resources and each of these distributors is under no contractual obligation to continue carrying our products 
further  many of our distributors may carry our competitors products  and may promote our competitors products over our own products 
finally  we do not have at this time distribution partners in the united states or overseas who distribute our products for the human diagnostic market 
we currently have exclusive distribution agreements for our vetscan dsx products in argentina  australia  austria  bahrain  china  greece  japan  korea  mexico  new zealand  portugal  south africa  spain  switzerland  united arab emirates and the united kingdom 
our distributor in each of these countries is responsible for obtaining the necessary approvals to sell our products 
these distributors may not be successful in obtaining proper approvals for our products in their respective countries  and they may not be successful in marketing our products 
we plan to enter into additional distribution agreements to expand our international distribution base and solidify our international presence 
however  we may not be successful in entering into additional distributor agreements 
our distributors may terminate their relationship with us at any time 
historically  we have experienced a high degree of turnover among our international distributors 
this high degree of turnover makes it difficult for us to establish a steady distribution network overseas 
consequently  we may not be successful in marketing our piccolo system and vetscan dxs products internationally 
we depend on sole suppliers for several key components to our products  many of whom we have not entered into contractual relationships with 
table of contents we use several key components that are currently available from limited or sole sources as discussed below reagent discs two injection molding manufacturers  c 
brewer co 
and nypro oregon  inc  currently make the molded plastic discs which  when loaded with reagents and welded together  form our reagent disc products 
we believe that only a few manufacturers are capable of producing these discs to the narrow tolerances that we require  to date  we have only qualified these two manufacturers  with nypro oregon  inc being qualified at two separate facilities  to manufacture the molded plastic discs 
reagent chemicals we currently depend on the following single source vendors for some of the chemicals that we use to produce the dry reagent chemistry beads that are either inserted in our reagent discs or sold as a stand alone product amano enzyme usa co  ltd  biozyme labs international ltd  genzyme corporation  kikkoman corporation biochemical division  lee biosolutions  inc  the diagnostic systems and molecular biochemicals divisions of f 
hoffman la roche  ltd  shinko american inc  sigma aldrich inc and worthington biochemical corporation 
blood analyzer components our analyzer products use several technologically advanced components that we currently purchase from two single source vendors  perkinelmer  inc and electro alliance  inc 
our analyzers use a printer that is only made by sanyo north america corporation 
the loss of the supply of any of these components could force us to redesign our analyzers 
hematology instrument and reagents we currently purchase hmt instruments and reagents from melet schloesing laboratories melet of france 
we operate on a purchase order basis with all of the suppliers of our molded plastic reagent disks  reagent chemicals  and blood analyzer components and thus these suppliers are under no contractual obligation to supply us with their products or to do so at specified prices 
although we believe that there are potential alternate suppliers available for these critical components  to date we have not qualified additional vendors beyond those referenced above 
because we are dependent on a limited number of suppliers and manufacturers for critical components to our products  we are particularly susceptible to any interruption in the supply of these products or the viability of our assembly arrangements 
the loss of any one of these suppliers or a disruption in our manufacturing arrangements could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition 
we compete with larger  better established entities such as hospitals and commercial laboratories blood analysis is a well established field in which there are a number of competitors that have substantially greater financial resources and larger  more established marketing  sales and service organizations than we do 
we compete with the following organizations commercial clinical laboratories  hospitals clinical laboratories  and manufacturers of bench top multi test blood analyzers and other testing systems that health care providers can use on site 
we may not be able to compete with these organizations or their products or with future organizations or future products historically  hospitals and commercial laboratories perform the most human medical testing  and commercial laboratories perform the most veterinary medical testing 
we have identified five principal factors that customers typically use to evaluate our products and those of our competitors 
these factors are range of tests offered  the immediacy of results  cost effectiveness  
table of contents ease of use  and reliability of results 
we believe that we compete effectively on each of these factors except for the range of tests offered 
clinical laboratories are effective at processing large panels of tests using skilled technicians and complex equipment 
while our current offering of reagent discs cannot provide the same broad range of tests  we believe that in certain limited markets our products provide a sufficient breadth of test menus to compete successfully with clinical laboratories given the advantages of our products with respect to the other four factors 
however  we cannot assure you that we will continue to be able to compete effectively on cost effectiveness  ease of use  immediacy of results or reliability of results 
we also cannot assure you that we will ever be able to compete effectively solely on the basis of range of tests offered 
competition in the human and veterinary diagnostic markets is intense 
our principal competitors in the human blood analyzer market are alfa wassermann spa  hemagen diagnostics  inc  i stat corporation  johnson johnson including its subsidiary  ortho clinical diagnostics  inc  novitron international  inc 
and roche 
our principal competitors in the veterinary blood analyzer market are idexx laboratories  inc and heska corporation 
most of our competitors have significantly greater financial and other resources than we do 
in particular  many of our competitors have large sales forces and well established distribution channels 
consequently  we must develop our distribution channels and improve our direct sales force in order to compete in these markets 
changes in third party payor reimbursement regulations can negatively affect our business by regulating the maximum amount of reimbursement they will provide for blood testing services  third party payors  such as hmos  pay per service insurance plans  medicare and medicaid  can indirectly affect the pricing or the relative attractiveness of our human testing products 
for example  the health care financing administration sets the level of reimbursement of fees for blood testing services for medicare beneficiaries 
if third party payors decrease the reimbursement amounts for blood testing services  it may decrease the amount that physicians and hospitals are able to charge patients for such services 
consequently  we will need to charge less for our products 
if the government and third party payors do not provide for adequate coverage and reimbursement levels to allow health care providers to use our products  the demand for our products will decrease 
we are subject to numerous governmental regulations need for fda certification for our medical device products our piccolo products are regulated under the medical device amendments to the food  drug and cosmetic act  which is administered by the food and drug administration 
the fda has classified our piccolo products as class i and class ii devices 
these classifications require us to submit to the fda a pre market notification form or k 
the fda uses the k to substantiate product claims that are made by medical device manufacturers prior to marketing 
in our k notification  we must  among other things  establish that the product we plan to market is substantially equivalent to a product that was on the market prior to the adoption of the medical device amendment or to a product that the fda has previously cleared under the k process 
the fda review process of a k notification can last anywhere from three to six months  and the fda must issue a written order finding substantial equivalence before a company can market a medical device 
to date  we have received market clearance from the fda for our piccolo system and reagent tests that we have on eight reagent discs 
we are currently developing additional tests that the fda will have to clear through the k notification procedures 
these new test products are crucial for our success in the human diagnostic market 
if we do not receive k clearance for a particular product  we will not be able to sell that product in the united states 
need to comply with manufacturing regulations the medical device amendment also requires us to manufacture our piccolo products in accordance with good manufacturing practices guidelines 
current good manufacturing practice requirements are set forth in the quality system regulation 
these requirements regulate the methods used in  and the facilities and controls used for  the design  manufacture  packaging  storage  installation and servicing of our medical devices intended for human use 
our manufacturing facility is subject to periodic audits 
in addition  various state regulatory agencies may regulate the manufacture of our products 
for example  we have obtained a license from the state of california to manufacture our products 
in september  the fda granted our manufacturing facility in compliance status  based on the regulations for good manufacturing practices for medical devices 
we are scheduled for inspection by the fda and the 
table of contents state of california on a routine basis  typically once every months 
in april  the state of california granted licensing for the new union city facility in early may the most recent inspection was in march when the fda conducted a facilities inspection and verified our compliance with the cfr regulation 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully pass a re inspection by the fda or the state of california 
in addition  we cannot assure you that we can comply with all current or future government manufacturing requirements and regulations 
if we are unable to comply with the regulations  or if we do not pass routine inspections  our business and results of operations will be materially adversely affected 
effects of the clinical laboratory improvement amendments on our products our piccolo products are affected by the clinical laboratory improvement amendments of the clinical laboratory improvement amendments are intended to insure the quality and reliability of all medical testing in the united states regardless of where tests are performed 
the current clinical laboratory improvement amendments divide laboratory tests into three categories simple  moderately complex and highly complex 
tests performed using the piccolo system are in the moderately complex category 
this category requires that any location in which testing is performed be certified as a laboratory 
hence  we can only sell our piccolo products to customers who meet the standards of a laboratory 
to receive laboratory certification  a testing facility must be certified by the health care financing administration 
after the testing facility receives a laboratory certification  it must then meet the clinical laboratory improvement amendments regulations 
because we can only sell our piccolo products to testing facilities that are certified laboratories  the market for our products is correspondingly constrained 
consequently  the market for our piccolo products will be confined to those testing facilities that are certified as laboratories and our growth will be limited accordingly 
we are subject to various federal  state and local regulations federal and state regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of health care products and diagnostic devices may change 
we cannot predict what impact  if any  such changes would have on our business 
in addition  as we continue to sell in foreign markets  we may have to obtain additional governmental clearances in those markets 
we may not be able to obtain regulatory clearances for our products in the united states or in foreign markets  and the failure to obtain these regulatory clearances will materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 
although we believe that we will be able to comply with all applicable regulations of the food and drug administration and of the state of california  including quality system regulations  current regulations depend on administrative interpretations 
future interpretations made by the food and drug administration  the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms or other regulatory bodies may adversely affect our business 
we depend on key members of our management and scientific staff  and we must retain and recruit qualified individuals if we are to be competitive we are highly dependent on the principal members of our management and scientific staff 
the loss of any of these key personnel  including in particular clinton h 
severson  our president  chief executive officer and chairman of our board of directors  might impede the achievement of our business objectives 
mr 
severson s amended and restated employment agreement with us was filed with the sec on august  as an exhibit to our quarterly report for the quarter ended june  we are not aware of any member of our executive management team who intends to retire within one year of the date of this filing 
we currently do not maintain key man life insurance on any of our employees 
although historically we have been relatively successful both in retaining our current management and scientific staff and attracting and retaining skilled and experienced marketing  sales and manufacturing personnel  we may not be able to employ such personnel on acceptable terms in the future because numerous medical products and other high technology companies compete for the services of these qualified individuals 
we may inadvertently produce defective products  which may subject us to significant warranty liabilities or product liability claims and we may have insufficient product liability insurance our business involves applying sophisticated methods to raw materials and producing defect free medical test equipment 
although we have established procedures for quality control on both the raw materials that we receive from suppliers and our manufactured final products  these procedures may prove inadequate to detect a defect that either occurs in limited quantities or that we have not anticipated 
should we inadvertently ship defective products  we may be subject to substantial claims under our warranty policy 
further  our business exposes us to potential product liability 
table of contents risks  which are inherent in the testing  manufacturing and marketing of human and veterinary medical products 
we currently maintain product liability insurance 
we believe that this insurance is adequate for our needs  taking into account the risks involved and cost of coverage 
however  our product liability insurance may be insufficient to cover potential liabilities 
in addition  in the future the coverage that we require may be unavailable on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
even with our current insurance coverage  a mass product defect  product liability claim or recall could materially adversely affect our business or our financial condition 
legislative actions  higher insurance cost and potential new accounting pronouncements are likely to cause our general and administrative expenses to increase and impact our future financial position and results of operations in order to comply with the newly adopted sarbanes oxley act of  as well as proposed changes to listing standards by nasdaq  and proposed accounting changes by the securities and exchange commission  we may be required to enhance our internal controls  hire additional personnel and utilize additional outside legal  accounting and advisory services  all of which will cause our general and administrative costs to increase 
insurers are also likely to increase premiums as a result of the high claims rates incurred over the past year  and so our premiums for our various insurance policies  including our directors and officers insurance policies  are likely to increase 
proposed changes in the accounting rules  including legislative and other proposals to account for employee stock options as a compensation expense among others  could materially increase the expenses that we report under generally accepted accounting principles and adversely affect our operating results 
we must comply with strict and potentially costly environmental regulations we are subject to stringent federal  state and local laws  rules  regulations and policies that govern the use  generation  manufacture  storage  air emission  effluent discharge  handling and disposal of certain materials and wastes 
in particular  we are subject to laws  rules and regulations governing the handling and disposal of biohazardous materials used in the development and testing of our products 
we handle and dispose of human and veterinary blood samples for testing whole blood  plasma  serum and we pay approximately  per year to comply with applicable environmental regulations 
although we believe that we have complied with applicable laws and regulations in all material respects and have not been required to take any action to correct any noncompliance  we may have to incur significant costs to comply with environmental regulations if our manufacturing to commercial levels continues to increase 
in addition  if a government agency determines that we have not complied with these laws  rules and regulations  we may have to pay significant fines and or take remedial action that would be expensive and we do not carry environmental related insurance coverage 
system failures or delays may harm our business and our facilities and manufacturing operations are vulnerable to natural disasters and other unexpected losses our success depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our manufacturing operations  which are co located with our corporate headquarters in union city  california 
a failure of manufacturing operations  be it in the development and manufacturing of our vetscan or piccolo analyzers or the reagent discs used in the analyzers could result in our inability to supply customer demand 
we do not have a backup facility to provide redundant manufacturing capacity in the event of a system failure 
accordingly  if our union city location experienced a system failure  or regulatory problem that temporarily shut down our manufacturing facility  our manufacturing ability would become unavailable until we were able to bring an alternative facility online  a process which could take several weeks or even months 
these manufacturing operations are also vulnerable to damage from earthquakes  fire  floods  power loss  telecommunications failures  break ins and similar events 
although we carry property and business interruption insurance  our coverage may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur 
additionally  our computer servers may be vulnerable to computer viruses  physical or electronic break ins and similar disruptions 
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and the possible lack of financial stability in foreign countries could prevent overseas sales growth our international sales are overwhelmingly currently us dollar denominated 
as a result  an increase or decrease in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less or more competitive in international markets 
for the limited amount of our sales denominated in local currencies  we are subject to 
table of contents fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and the particular local currency 
our operating results could also be adversely affected by the seasonality of international sales and the economic conditions of our overseas markets 
our stock price is highly volatile and investing in our stock involves a high degree of risk the market price of our common stock  like the securities of many other medical products companies  fluctuates over a wide range  and will continue to be highly volatile in the future 
during the past two fiscal years  our stock price traded at a high of on january  and a low of on april  the following factors may affect the market price of our common stock fluctuation in our operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new commercial products by us or our competitors  changes in governmental regulation  prospects and proposals for health care reform  governmental or third party payors controls on prices that our customers may pay for our products  developments or disputes concerning patent or our other proprietary rights  public concern as to the safety of our devices or similar devices developed by our competitors  and general market conditions 
because our stock price is so volatile  investing in our common stock is highly risky 
a potential investor must be able to withstand the loss of his entire investment in our common stock 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks with respect to interest rates on our accounts receivable line of credit  long term debt and cash equivalent investments 
for our accounts receivable line of credit  the interest rate is equal to the prime rate 
consequently  an increase in the prime rate would expose us to higher interest expenses 
there was no outstanding balance on our accounts receivable line of credit at march  for our long term debt  which is our equipment loan  the interest rate is equal to over the prime rate 
as with our accounts receivable credit facility  any increase in interest rates would expose us to higher interest expenses 
the balance on our long term debt was  as of march  based on this balance  for each increase in the prime rate  we would pay a total of approximately  of additional interest each quarter 
all of our sales are denominated in us dollars  except for sales under our oem agreement to provide vetscan systems to melet which are denominated in euros 
sales to melet during our fiscal year ended march  were of our total revenues 
at march   the net receivable from melet was as a matter of management policy  we do not currently enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments 
in the event we do enter into such transactions in the future  such items will be accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  in which case we will formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items  as well as our risk management objective and strategy for undertaking such hedge transactions
