table of contents overview we design  manufacture and support a group of key components and subsystems for vacuum process systems 
our primary products are complex power conversion and control systems 
our products also control the flow of gases into the process chambers and provide thermal control and sensing within the chamber 
our customers use our products in plasma based thin film processing equipment that is essential to the manufacture of semiconductors  compact disks  dvds and other digital storage media  flat panel computer and television screens  coatings for architectural glass and optics  and a power supply for advanced technology computer workstations 
we also sell spare parts and repair services worldwide through our customer service and technical support organization 
we provide solutions to a diversity of markets and geographic regions 
however  we are focused on the semiconductor capital equipment industry  which accounted for approximately of our sales in  in and in in  the semiconductor capital equipment industry was at its historical peak for sales 
conversely  the years and saw the steepest cutback in capital equipment purchases in industry history 
these cyclical changes accounted for the reduction in our sales to the semiconductor capital equipment industry between and and the further reduction of in to this industry excluding the effect of our acquisitions in of aera japan limited  or aera  and dressler hf technik gmbh  or dressler 
we expect future sales to the semiconductor capital equipment industry to represent approximately to of our total revenue  depending upon the strength or weakness of the industry cycles 
additionally  two of the other major industry groups which use our products  data storage and flat panel display  are also highly cyclical and have experienced significant reductions in demand during the through period 
we have incurred significant losses over the past two years primarily as a result of lower revenues 
our results in include revenues from two companies acquired during the year  aera and dressler 
had the acquisitions not occurred  and revenues would have been relatively flat 
to date  we have been unable to achieve profitability at current revenue levels and do not have confidence of an industry recovery in the short term 
we have established a goal of reducing our operating breakeven point to an annual revenue level of approximately million to million by the end of  but cannot provide any assurance that such goals or revenue level are achievable in our losses during and were impacted by high product costs and other expenses  primarily research and development  sales and marketing  and general and administrative expenses 
to address product costs we are in the process of shifting a significant portion of our manufacturing to china  rebalancing our supply chain to tier one asian suppliers  and relocating certain domestic operations to our headquarters in fort collins  colorado 
we will also attempt to reduce research and development expenses without significantly impacting our future competitive position in the rapidly changing industry in which we operate 

table of contents our operating results during and were also affected by high inventory reserves and warranty expenses 
as the industry downturn became longer and deeper than expected  a significant portion of our inventory became slow moving or obsolete based on reduced sales forecasts and the discontinuance of slower moving  older products 
warranty costs have been unusually high because of the shipment of some of our newer  more complex products developed in and  which required substantial rework  repair and in some cases  replacement in accordance with the terms of our warranties 
we believe the current generation of these products have much higher reliability 
we believe the semiconductor capital equipment industry is in the midst of significant consolidation 
to help insure our continued growth and maintain our competitive advantage  by being able to supply an increased proportion of the key components and subsystems used in plasma based manufacturing  we have done the following in march  we acquired dressler hf technik gmbh  which supplies radio frequency  or rf power solutions 
in january  we acquired aera japan limited 
aera primarily supplies the semiconductor capital equipment industry with product lines that include digital mass flow controllers  pressure based mass flow controllers  liquid mass flow controllers  ultrasonic liquid flow meters and liquid vapor delivery systems 
in january  we acquired engineering measurements company  or emco  which manufactures electronic and electromechanical precision instruments for measuring and controlling the flow of liquids  steam and gases for the semiconductor and other industries 
in august  we acquired sekidenko  inc  which supplies optical fiber thermometers to measure temperature in the semiconductor process chamber 
in april  we acquired noah holdings  inc  which manufactures solid state temperature control systems to control process temperatures during semiconductor manufacturing 
these product offerings complement our position as a global leader for complex power conversion and control systems and process instruments  allowing us to provide best of breed components and develop systems to increase the precision and productivity of our customers products 
it is also possible that we will acquire other companies or form strategic alliances 

table of contents results of operations sales sales were million in  million in and million in  representing an increase of from to  and a decrease of from to excluding the acquisitions of aera and dressler  our sales would have been relatively flat from to the decrease in the level of our sales in and from was primarily due to changes in demand for our products from semiconductor capital equipment manufacturers  including many of our largest customers  and data storage and flat panel display customers 
the historical volatility in the semiconductor industry impacted overall investment activities  which led to semiconductor manufacturers purchasing less capital equipment while the other industries were more impacted by general economic conditions 
while sales of semiconductor capital equipment have grown at a compounded annual growth rate in excess of since  the industry is highly cyclical and is impacted by changes in the macroeconomic environment  changes in semiconductor supply and demand  and rapid technological advances in both semiconductor devices and wafer fabrication processes 
rapid growth and expansion during was followed by the most sudden and pronounced slump in industry history  with year to year revenues falling approximately throughout the industry from to and declining nominally from to our sales over the last three years illustrate this cyclicality 
the following tables summarize annual net sales  and percentages of net sales  by customer type for each of the three years in the period ended december  sales for the year ended december  include combined sales from aera and dressler  subsequent to their acquisitions of approximately million years ended december  in thousands semiconductor capital equipment data storage flat panel display advanced product applications customer service technical support years ended december  semiconductor capital equipment data storage flat panel display advanced product applications customer service technical support 
table of contents the following table summarizes annual percentage changes in net sales by customer type for us from to  including the effects of our acquisitions of aera and dressler  and from to change change from from semiconductor capital equipment data storage flat panel display advanced product applications customer service technical support total sales excluding aera and dressler unchanged excluding aera and dressler the following tables summarize annual net sales  and percentages of net sales  by geographic region for each of the three years in the period ended december  years ended december  in thousands united states and canada europe asia pacific rest of world years ended december  united states and canada europe asia pacific rest of world gross margin our gross margin was in  in and in our gross margin remained relatively consistent between and the major items affecting the reduction in our and margins from our margin were during  the semiconductor industry and advanced energy experienced unprecedented new order and revenue growth 
however  in and we experienced the most severe downturn in the semiconductor industry s history 
as a result our sales declined significantly which impacted our absorption of fixed costs 
the semiconductor industry is moving to mm wafers and smaller line widths 
these technology changes require new products that we have developed or are developing 
typical of products early in their life cycle and at low production levels  these products have lower margins than our established products 
margins on these products should improve over the next to months 

table of contents although we have reduced our fixed overhead through reductions in force of some of our manufacturing staff in and  to coincide with our sales decline  we retained certain knowledgeable employees with specific skill sets  to be ready for unexpected industry ramp ups 
our cost of sales has also been adversely affected by periodic writedowns of excess and obsolete inventory  particularly in the fourth quarter of  when our management made a strategic decision to discontinue certain product offerings  which resulted in an increase in excess and obsolete inventory expense 
in and  we incurred warranty expense in excess of historical rates and our expectations related to certain products  which required substantial rework  repair  and in some cases  replacement 
the development of these products in and was accelerated to meet pressing customer needs in the midst of historically high product demand 
we believe the current generation of these products have much higher reliability 
given the rapid change in technology  we monitor and forecast expected inventory needs based on our constantly changing sales forecast 
inventory is written down or written off when it becomes obsolete  generally because of engineering changes to a product or discontinuance of a product line  or when it is deemed excess 
these determinations involve the exercise of significant judgment  and as demonstrated in recent periods  demand for our products is volatile and changes in expectations regarding the level of future sales can result in substantial charges against earnings for obsolete and excess inventory 
charges for obsolete and excess inventory were million in  million in and  in  which affected gross margins by  and in these years  respectively 
the amount of inventory written down in is primarily attributable to a strategic management decision we made in the fourth quarter to discontinue certain product offerings  coupled with the decline in sales from the third quarter of to the fourth quarter of the inventory writedown in is primarily attributable to the severe decrease in product sales  which caused a larger than normal amount of inventory to become excess based on our sales forecasts 
we provide warranty coverage for our products ranging from to months  with the majority of our products ranging from to months  and estimate the anticipated costs of repairing our products under such warranties based on the historical costs of the repairs and expected product failure rates 
the assumptions we use to estimate warranty accruals are reevaluated periodically in light of actual experience  and when appropriate  the accruals are adjusted 
our determination of the appropriate level of warranty accrual is subjective and based on estimates 
should product failure rates differ from our estimates  actual costs could vary significantly from our expectations 
we recognized charges for warranty expense of million in  million in and million in 
table of contents the following summarizes the activity in our warranty reserve during balance at additions balance at beginning of charged end of period to expense deductions period in thousands reserve for warranty obligations historically  price competition has not had a material effect on margins 
however  as a result of the prolonged downturn in the semiconductor industry  oems and semiconductor capital equipment manufacturers are striving to reduce their costs 
any cost reduction programs initiated by oems and semiconductor capital equipment manufacturers could have a significant impact on our future gross margins 
research and development we believe continued investment in the research and development of new products and subsystems is critical to our ability to serve new and existing markets  develop new products and improve existing product designs 
however  we cannot provide assurance that the products we develop will meet customer requirements when those products are introduced to the market 
to be advantageously positioned for a turnaround in demand we continue to invest heavily in new product development even during industry downturns  which allows us to compete for ongoing design wins on our customers new production tools 
since our inception  all of our research and development costs have been expensed as incurred 
our research and development expenses were million in  million in and million in as a percentage of sales  research and development expenses decreased from in to in  because of the higher sales base achieved through our acquisitions of aera and dressler 
research and development expenses  as a percentage of sales  increased from in to in because of the lower sales base 
the increase in research and development expenses from to was primarily due to the acquisitions of aera and dressler and expenditures to launch new rf and direct current  or dc products 
our increase in research and development expenses from to was primarily caused by increases in payroll  materials and supplies and depreciation of equipment used for new product development as well as the acquisition of emco in sales and marketing expenses as we continue to expand our product offerings and sales channels through acquisitions  our sales and marketing efforts have become increasingly complex 
we continue to refine our sales and marketing functions as we acquire and integrate new companies 
we have continued the effort to market directly to end users of our products  in addition to our traditional marketing to manufacturers of semiconductor capital equipment and other industries 
our sales and marketing expenses support domestic and 
table of contents international sales and marketing activities that include personnel  trade shows  advertising  and other selling and marketing activities 
sales and marketing expenses were million in  million in and million in the increase in sales and marketing expenses from to was primarily caused by the acquisitions of aera and dressler  which contributed approximately million to our sales and marketing expenses 
as a percentage of sales  sales and marketing expenses increased from in to in sales and marketing expenses increased from in to of sales in due to the lower sales base in general and administrative expenses our general and administrative expenses support our worldwide corporate  legal  patent  tax  financial  administrative  information systems and human resources functions in addition to our general management 
general and administrative expenses were million in  million in and million in the increase in general and administrative expenses from to was primarily caused by our acquisitions of aera and dressler  which contributed approximately million to our general and administrative expenses 
the decrease from to was primarily due to lower spending for payroll  primarily employee bonuses  which were eliminated in due to the decline in operating profitability 
due to the cost reduction measures we initiated in the third and fourth quarters of  we expect our general and administrative expenses to decline in see restructuring charges below for a discussion of these cost reduction measures 
goodwill and other intangible asset impairments beginning in april  we made periodic advances to and investments totaling approximately million in symphony systems  inc  a privately held  early stage developer of equipment productivity management software 
some of our advances were secured by symphony s intellectual property 
in  we obtained an exclusive license  for which we paid million  to use symphony s products in the semiconductor industry 
beginning in the third quarter of  and continuing through the end of the year  symphony s financial situation began to deteriorate significantly  and we determined that due to symphony s need for immediate liquidity  its declining business prospects  including the indefinite postponement of a significant order for its products from a major semiconductor capital equipment manufacturer  and other factors  the value of our investment in and advances to symphony had substantially declined 
we therefore valued our investments in and advances to symphony at december   at approximately million  which reflected our assessment of the value of the symphony technology license  which we believed had continuing value to us 
the amount of the impairment related to symphony was million  all of which was recorded in as an operating expense 

table of contents symphony effectively ceased operations in february  and we hired symphony s key employees  and acquired symphony s remaining assets in a foreclosure and liquidation sale of such assets on april  we recorded the assets acquired at their estimated fair values  based on information available at the time 
the excess purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible assets acquired of approximately million was allocated to amortizable intangibles  with a weighted average estimated useful life of approximately years 
in the fourth quarter of  the semiconductor industry declined substantially from its levels in the third quarter of  which caused a decrease in our sales level of approximately 
as a result  we determined there would be a significant delay by the semiconductor capital equipment industry in adopting advanced connectivity technology  and due to these industry conditions as well as our future strategic priorities  these intangible assets were likely impaired 
we evaluated the carrying amount of assets acquired from symphony by comparing its estimated future cash flows to its carrying value 
this analysis indicated that our investment was impaired and we recorded an intangible impairment charge of million for  which was the remaining book value of symphony s intangible assets 
during the second quarter of  we terminated the operations of our tower electronics  inc subsidiary and our fourth state technology  or fst  product line due to significant softening in the projected demand for these products 
revenue contributed by tower and fst operations for and represented less than five percent of our total revenue in each of these years 
as a result of these actions  estimated related future cash flows no longer supported the carrying amounts of related goodwill  and we recorded goodwill impairment charges of million in related to tower and fst 
restructuring  merger costs and litigation costs in april  we acquired noah in a pooling of interests under the previous rules of accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
the merger involved the exchange of  shares of advanced energy common stock for the privately held common stock of noah 
as part of the business combination  we recorded a charge of million in the second quarter of for merger costs  which could not be capitalized and which in certain cases were nondeductible for income tax purposes 
in july  we announced the consolidation of our tower facility in fridley  minnesota  into our existing facility in voorhees  new jersey 
we recorded a restructuring charge of million in the third quarter of related to the consolidation  which was completed during the fourth quarter of in august  we acquired sekidenko in a merger that was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
this merger involved the exchange of million shares of advanced energy common stock for the privately held common stock of sekidenko 
as part of the business combination  we recorded a charge of million in the third quarter 
table of contents of for merger costs  which could not be capitalized and which in certain cases were nondeductible for income tax purposes 
in july  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 which required that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  in the first quarter of  we received a million settlement for recovery of legal expenses pertaining to a patent infringement suit in which we were the plaintiff 
during the second quarter of  in response to the downturn in the semiconductor capital equipment industry  we implemented two reductions in force totaling approximately regular employees and temporary employees and recorded a charge of  for restructuring and severance costs  including fringe benefits 
during the fourth quarter of  in response to the sustained downturn in the semiconductor capital equipment industry and global economy  we announced and implemented additional cost reduction measures  and recorded a charge of million 
such measures included a reduction in force of approximately employees and the closure of two facilities 
during the second quarter of  we recorded a charge of million pertaining to damages awarded by a jury in a patent infringement case in which we were the defendant  and legal expenses related to the judgment 
the applied science and technology  or astex  division of mks instruments  inc was the plaintiff in the case  which was tried in a delaware court 
sales of the product in question have accounted for less than of total sales since the product s introduction  and approximately of our consolidated sales for the year ended december  we have entered into a settlement agreement with mks allowing us to sell the infringing product to our customer subsequent to the date of the jury award 
under the settlement agreement  royalties payable to mks from the sales of the related product were approximately  in  and are recorded as a component of cost of sales 
in the third quarter of  we began a program to gradually reduce our quarterly operating breakeven level from revenue of approximately million without impacting our long term viability 
our objective is to have a variable operating model by the end of that will allow us to achieve approximate breakeven operating results at a quarterly revenue level of million to million 
we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately million to close two facilities and implement headcount reductions of approximately employees  or approximately of our workforce 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded an additional restructuring charge of million 
this charge included a reduction in force of employees  or approximately of our workforce and the closure of all or a portion of five facilities in the united states 

table of contents as a result of our decisions in the fourth quarter to consolidate certain operations  we performed an analysis of the fair value of emco s long lived assets 
this analysis included an appraisal of emco s land and building  which indicated an impairment of approximately  which has been reflected as restructuring charges in the accompanying statement of operations 
we may incur additional restructuring charges in of to million as we continue to take actions to reduce our operating costs 
other income expense other income expense consists primarily of interest income and expense  foreign exchange gains and losses and other miscellaneous gains  losses  income and expense items 
interest income was approximately million in  million in and million in our interest income in was lower than in due to our use of cash and marketable securities to finance the acquisitions of aera in january and dressler in march  and to repurchase a portion of our and convertible subordinated notes in the open market in the fourth quarter of interest income in was lower than in due to our use of cash and marketable securities to repurchase a portion of our convertible subordinated notes in the fourth quarter of and due to our purchase of emco in january interest income also declined throughout and due to the federal reserve lowering interest rates throughout the period 
the prime rate declined from in january to in december and our yield declined from a high of to approximately on a pre tax basis 
interest expense consists principally of accruals of interest on our convertible subordinated notes  amortization of our deferred offering costs on these notes  and bank loans and capital leases assumed in the acquisition of aera 
interest expense was approximately million in  million in and million in the increase in interest expense from to was primarily due to the issuance of our convertible subordinated notes in august and the debt and capital leases assumed in the acquisition of aera in january interest expense was relatively unchanged from to our foreign subsidiaries sales are primarily denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
we recorded a net foreign currency gain of million in  and losses of  in and  in our foreign currency gain in was primarily related to an intercompany loan of japanese yen  which was settled subsequent to december   that we made to our wholly owned subsidiary advanced energy japan kk  or ae japan  which has a functional currency of yen  for the purpose of effecting the acquisition of aera 
the loan 
table of contents was transacted in the first quarter of  for approximately billion yen  approximately million based upon an exchange rate of approximately during the first half of the year  the us dollar weakened significantly against the yen to approximately  resulting in a gain of million 
in july and september  we entered into various foreign currency forward contracts with our primary banks to mitigate the effects of potential future currency fluctuations between the dollar and the yen until the associated intercompany obligations are settled 
miscellaneous expense items were million in and million in the increase in miscellaneous expense in from was primarily related to the impairment of certain marketable equity securities 
during the fourth quarter of  the fair value of these securities continued a substantial decline and we determined the decline was other than temporary as defined by the financial accounting standards board 
as a result we recorded an impairment of approximately million 
as of february  the value of this investment has declined an additional  if the fair value of this investment does not return to its december  carrying value by the end of the first quarter of  we will record an additional impairment in the first quarter of our remaining carrying balance at december  was approximately million 
miscellaneous income of million in was primarily due to a million gain on a sale of an investment 
benefit provision for income taxes the income tax benefit of million for  which included a provision of million for an extraordinary item  represented an effective tax rate of 
the income tax benefit of million for represented an effective rate of 
the income tax provision of million in  which included million of provision for an extraordinary item  represented an effective rate of 
changes in our relative earnings and the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries affect our consolidated effective tax rate 
we adjust our income taxes periodically based upon the anticipated tax status of all foreign and domestic entities  and have adopted income tax planning strategies to reduce our worldwide income tax expense 
realization of our net deferred tax asset is dependent upon our generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate tax jurisdictions in future years to obtain benefit from the reversal of net deductible temporary differences and from tax credit carryforwards 
when recording acquisitions  we have recorded valuation allowances due to the uncertainty related to the realization of certain deferred tax assets existing at december  the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future periods if estimates of future taxable income are changed 
we believe that it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of our deferred tax asset  net of valuation allowance  as of december  reversals of valuation allowances recorded in purchase accounting will be reflected as a reduction of goodwill in the period of reversal 

table of contents extraordinary gain in the fourth quarter of  we repurchased approximately million of our convertible subordinated notes and million of our convertible subordinated notes in the open market at an aggregate cost of approximately million 
these purchases resulted in a pretax extraordinary gain of million  or million after tax

 percentage of sales sales gross margin income loss from operations other income expense extraordinary item net of income taxes net income loss due to the cyclical nature of the semiconductor capital equipment industry  and the sudden changes resulting in severe downturns and upturns  we have experienced and expect to continue to experience significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results 
our levels of operating expenditures are based  in part  on expectations of future revenues that such expenses support 
if revenue levels in a particular quarter do not meet expectations  operating results may be adversely affected 
our quarterly operating results in and reflect the fluctuating demand for our products during this period  principally from manufacturers of semiconductor capital equipment  data storage equipment and flat panel displays  and our ability to adjust our manufacturing capacity and infrastructure to meet this demand 
sales to the semiconductor capital equipment industry decreased each quarter throughout then increased in the first quarter of and in the second quarter of sales to the semiconductor capital equipment industry then declined in the third quarter of and a further in the fourth quarter of  due to the market conditions discussed above 
these percentage changes in exclude the effects of our acquisitions of aera and dressler 
data storage sales fluctuated significantly throughout both years 
flat panel sales declined throughout  then increased substantially in the third and fourth quarters of our revenue from all sectors is heavily influenced by general economic conditions and consumer spending patterns in each of the industries we serve 
we added new facilities in fort collins  colorado in the first quarter of to increase our manufacturing capacity to continue to meet the growth that was expected 
table of contents throughout  which substantially increased our fixed costs 
then  as we entered the sudden and steep decline in volume from the semiconductor capital equipment industry in that quarter  the combination of declining sales and higher fixed costs resulted in lower absorption of fixed overhead and greatly reduced our gross margins throughout in addition  the industry slowdown caused more inventory to be deemed excess or obsolete  and warranty costs associated with certain products in excess of historical experience also adversely affected margins  particularly in the second quarter of and fourth quarter of in  gross margins improved each quarter through the third quarter  primarily due to better absorption from our increasing sales base 
in the fourth quarter of  our gross margin declined substantially as the sudden decline in our sales base of hampered our fixed cost absorption and caused us to adjust our excess and obsolete inventory reserves to reflect our revised sales outlook 
research and development  selling and marketing  and general and administrative expenses declined each quarter throughout  due to certain cost cutting measures we implemented in and research and development  selling and marketing  and general and administrative expenses increased in the second quarter of  due to our acquisitions of aera and dressler 
sales and marketing expenses increased in the third and fourth quarters of  due to general merit increases and trade show promotions 
general and administrative expenses increased in the fourth quarter of  primarily due to an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately million due to the extended economic downturn 
as a percentage of sales  operating expenses have generally declined during periods of rapid sales growth  when sales increased at a rate faster than our need or ability to add personnel and facilities to support the growth 
these operating expenses as a percentage of sales have generally increased during periods of flat or decreased sales  when our infrastructure is retained to support strong customer relationships and anticipated future growth 
other income expense consists primarily of interest income and expense  foreign currency gains and losses  and miscellaneous gains  losses  income and expense items 
changes in interest rates and changes in our level of investments in marketable securities drive the quarterly fluctuations in our interest income 
because the interest rates we pay on the majority of our long term debt are fixed  our levels of such debt determine our quarterly interest expense  which decrease when we repurchase such debt and which increase when we make new offerings 
our variable rate debt was assumed in our acquisition of aera 
at december   this debt had variable interest rates ranging from to 
changes in exchange rates and our ability to manage foreign currency exposure determine the quarterly fluctuations in our foreign currency gains and losses 
in the second quarter of  we recognized a foreign currency gain of approximately million related to an intercompany loan of japanese yen we made to our ae japan subsidiary  which has a functional currency of yen 
this loan was settled subsequent to december  miscellaneous expense items vary according to the frequency of non operating events 
the largest single item in this category was in the fourth quarter of when we recorded a million impairment of a marketable 
table of contents equity security that continued a substantial decline in value during the fourth quarter 
subsequent to december  this investment has continued to decline in value and we will record an additional impairment in the first quarter of if the value of this investment does not return to its december  carrying value by march  our effective rate for income tax provision and benefit fluctuated on a quarterly basis throughout and  varying from to 
the fluctuations were due to the timing of certain nondeductible expenses including goodwill impairment  and due to initiatives we implemented in to reduce our overall rate as well as changes in our relative earnings and the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries 
liquidity and capital resources our financing strategy has been to raise capital from debt and equity markets to provide liquidity to enable our investments in acquisitions and alliances  which support our strategic vision of being a single source provider of high value subsystems 
we maintain substantial levels of cash and marketable securities to have funding readily available for such investment opportunities when they arise 
since  to better enable such strategic investments  we have attained this liquidity with proceeds from underwritten public offerings of our common stock and  since  offerings of convertible subordinated debt 
operating activities used cash of million in  reflecting our net loss of million partially offset by non cash items of million and net working capital changes of approximately million 
non cash items primarily consisted of a million pretax gain on the retirement of a portion of our convertible notes  a million gain on an intercompany foreign currency loan  a million benefit for deferred income taxes  depreciation of property and equipment of million  amortization of intangible assets and demonstration and customer service equipment of million  provision for excess and obsolete inventory of million  provision for doubtful accounts of million  and impairments of million 
our impairments consisted of intangible assets of million  property and equipment of million and marketable securities of million 
net working capital changes provided cash of million and primarily consisted of a million increase in accounts receivable  a million increase in demonstration and customer service equipment  a million increase in accrued warranty costs  and a million increase in accrued restructuring charges 
operating activities generated cash of million in  reflecting our net loss of million adjusted for non cash items of million and changes in working capital of million 
non cash items primarily consisted of a million benefit for deferred income taxes  depreciation of property and equipment of million  amortization of intangible assets and demonstration equipment of million  provision for excess and obsolete inventory of million  and impairments of million

net working capital changes provided cash of million and primarily consisted of a 
table of contents million decrease in accounts receivable  a million increase in inventory  a million decrease in accounts payable  and a million increase in net income taxes receivable 
operating activities provided cash of million in  primarily as a result of net income of million  offset by non cash items of million and net working capital changes of million 
non cash items primarily consisted of a million benefit for deferred income taxes  depreciation of property and equipment of million  amortization of intangible assets and demonstration equipment of million  a gain on the sale of an investment of million  and a million pretax gain on the retirement of a portion of our convertible notes 
net working capital changes used cash of million and primarily consisted of a million increase in accounts receivable  a million increase in inventory  and a million decrease in net income taxes receivable 
we expect near term future operating activities to continue to use cash 
any future decline in the industries in which we operate could substantially affect our ability to collect payments from our customers  could cause us to initiate future reductions in force requiring substantial severance payments  and other cash payments to exit certain operating activities  among other uses of cash 
conversely  as receivable and inventory balances tend to fluctuate with net sales any future upturn in the industries we serve  primarily the semiconductor industry  may result in an increase in our net receivables and inventory balances 
we are typically required to use our cash reserves to finance our inventory purchases and extend credit to our customers to finance their purchases from us 
we are unable to provide any assurance regarding our future cash flow from operations 
investing activities provided cash of million in and consisted of cash generated by the net sale of marketable securities of million  partially offset by cash used for the acquisition of aera for million net of million of cash acquired  the acquisition of dressler for million net of  of cash acquired  the acquisition of the minority interest of litmas for  in addition to our common stock valued at approximately million  the purchase of property and equipment of million and the purchase of other investments of million 
although investing activities provided cash of million in  our total cash and marketable securities declined approximately million during our marketable securities are not considered cash equivalents  and a significant portion of these securities were sold during  to finance the above transactions as well as to fund our operating activities 
investing activities used cash of million in  and consisted of the acquisition of emco for million net of  of cash acquired  the net purchase of marketable securities of million  the purchase of investments and advances of million and the purchase of property and equipment of million 
investing activities provided cash of million in  and consisted primarily of the purchase of property and equipment of million and the purchase of investments of million  offset by proceeds from the sale of investments and marketable securities of million 

table of contents investing cash flows experience significant fluctuations from year to year as we buy and sell marketable securities  which we convert to cash to fund strategic investments and our operating cash flow  and as we transfer cash into marketable securities when we attain levels of cash that are greater than needed for current operations 
however  we do not expect to generate levels of cash that are greater than needed for our current operations in the near term 
financing activities used cash of million in  and consisted primarily of open market repurchases of our convertible notes of million  the repayment of notes payable and capital lease obligations of million  partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and sale of common stock through our employee stock purchase plan or espp of million 
the main uses of cash from financing activities in were open market repurchases of our convertible notes and payments for capital lease obligations and notes payable 
we expect our financing activities to continue to fluctuate in the future 
if market conditions and our financial position are deemed appropriate  we may repurchase additional convertible notes in the open market 
our payments under capital lease obligations and notes payable may also increase in the future if we enter into additional capital lease obligations or change the level of our bank financing 
our estimated payments under capital lease obligations and bank debt during will be approximately million 
however  a significant portion of these obligations are held in countries other than the united states  therefore future foreign currency fluctuations  especially between the dollar and the yen  could cause significant fluctuations in our estimated payment obligations 
financing activities provided cash of million in  and consisted primarily of proceeds from convertible debt of million and proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and sale of common stock through our espp of million 
financing activities used cash of million in  and consisted primarily of open market repurchases of our convertible notes of million  offset by proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and sale of common stock through our espp of million 
we plan to spend approximately million to million in for the acquisition of equipment  leasehold improvements and furnishings  with depreciation expense for projected to be million to million 
our planned level of capital expenditures is subject to frequent revisions because our business experiences sudden changes as we move into industry upturns and downturns and expected sales levels change 
in addition  changes in foreign currency may significantly impact our capital expenditures and depreciation expense recognized in a particular period 
as of december   we had working capital of million  a decrease of million from december  the principal causes of this decrease during were the use of cash to finance our operating activities  the purchase of certain 
table of contents investments and acquisitions  the repurchase of our convertible subordinated notes  and payments under our capital lease obligations and bank debt as discussed above 
our principal sources of liquidity consisted of million of cash and cash equivalents  million of marketable securities  and a credit facility consisting of a million revolving line of credit  none of which was outstanding at december  advances under the revolving line of credit bear interest at the prime rate at march  minus 
any advances under this revolving line of credit will be due and payable in may in july and september  we reduced our borrowing base by million in connection with foreign currency forward contracts we entered into  providing us with net borrowing availability of approximately million at december  subsequent to december   these foreign currency forward contracts matured 
we are subject to covenants on our line of credit that provide certain restrictions related to working capital  net worth  acquisitions and payment and declaration of dividends 
we were in compliance with all such covenants at december  we have committed to advance million to several privately held companies over the next two years 
we finance the majority of our facilities under operating leases  which are not reflected as an asset or liability in our accompanying balance sheets 
at december   we had the following future minimum commitments under noncancelable operating leases in thousands thereafter in addition to operating leases  we also have a contingent purchase price adjustment relating to our acquisition of dressler  which may require us to pay an additional million to the former shareholder of dressler  if dressler achieves certain key business objectives by march  to finance the facilities for our headquarters and main us manufacturing location  we lease our executive offices and manufacturing facilities in fort collins  colorado from two limited liability partnerships consisting of one of our directors  who is also an officer  a former director and other individuals unrelated to us 
the leases relating to these spaces expire in  and and contain monthly payments of approximately   and  respectively 
approximately million  million and million was paid and charged to rent expense attributable to these leases for the years ended december   and  respectively 

table of contents we believe that our cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  cash flow from operations and available borrowings  will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs for at least the next twelve months 
after that time  we may require additional equity or debt financing to address our working capital  capital equipment or expansion needs 
in addition  any significant acquisitions we make may require additional equity or debt financing to fund the purchase price  if paid in cash 
there can be no assurance that additional funding will be available when required or that it will be available on terms acceptable to us 
in  when our convertible subordinated notes become due  it is possible we may need substantial funds to repay such debt  which was million at december  our convertible subordinated notes of million are due september   and our convertible subordinated notes of million are due november  payment would be required if our common stock price remains at low levels throughout this period  the prices at which we can effect conversion are not met in the market in which our stock is traded  and the holders of our notes choose not to otherwise convert 
in such a situation there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance the debt 
we may continue to repurchase additional notes in the open market from time to time  if market conditions and our financial position are deemed favorable for such purposes 
critical accounting policies the preceding discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
in preparing our financial statements  we must make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
valuation of intangible assets and goodwill we have approximately million of intangible assets and goodwill as of december   including approximately million related to amortizable intangibles and million in goodwill 
in addition to the original cost of these assets  their recorded value is impacted by a number of our policy elections  including estimated useful lives  foreign currency fluctuations and impairment charges  if any 
in accordance with sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  we identified three reporting units 
generally  we allocated goodwill to the reporting unit that created goodwill upon its acquisition 
however  we believe that our recently acquired companies provide future growth opportunities to our core business and as a result we allocated approximately of the goodwill created upon the acquisitions of aera and emco to our core business 
we performed an annual impairment analysis of our non amortizable intangible assets and goodwill during the fourth quarter of  which indicated that no impairment was required 
this assessment requires estimates of future revenue  operating results and cash 
table of contents flows  as well as estimates of critical valuation inputs such as discount rates  terminal values and similar data 
we will continue to perform periodic and annual impairment analyses of the non amortizable intangible assets and goodwill resulting from our acquisitions 
as a result of future periodic  at least annual  impairment analyses we may record impairment charges that have a material adverse impact on our financial position and operating results 
additionally  we may make strategic business decisions in future periods which impact the fair value of our intangible assets and goodwill  which could result in significant impairment charges 
long lived assets including intangibles subject to amortization depreciation and amortization of our long lived assets is provided using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
changes in circumstances such as the passage of new laws or changes in regulations  technological advances  changes to our business model or changes in our capital strategy could result in the actual useful lives differing from initial estimates 
in those cases where we determine that the useful life of a long lived asset should be revised  we will depreciate the net book value in excess of the estimated residual value over its revised remaining useful life 
factors such as changes in the planned use of equipment  customer attrition  contractual amendments or mandated regulatory requirements could result in shortened useful lives 
long lived assets and asset groups are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
the estimated future cash flows are based upon  among other things  assumptions about expected future operating performance and may differ from actual cash flows 
long lived assets evaluated for impairment are grouped with other assets to the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities 
if the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows excluding interest is less than the carrying value of the assets  the assets will be written down to the estimated fair value in the period in which the determination is made 
impairments will also be assessed when assets are determined to be held for sale  as opposed to held and used in operations 
reserve for excess and obsolete inventory inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market 
given the rapid change in technology  we monitor and forecast expected inventory needs based on our constantly changing sales forecast 
inventory is written down or written off when it becomes obsolete  generally because of engineering changes to a product or discontinuance of a product line  or when it is deemed excess 
these determinations involve the exercise of significant judgment by management  and as demonstrated in recent periods demand for our products is volatile and changes in expectations regarding the level of future sales can result in substantial charges against earnings for obsolete and excess inventory 
following the above policy  we recorded charges of million in  the majority of which occurred during the fourth quarter 
reserve for warranty we provide warranty coverage for our products  ranging from to months  with the majority of our products ranging from to months  and estimate the anticipated costs of repairing our products under such warranties based on the historical costs of the repairs and expected product failure rates 

table of contents the assumptions we use to estimate warranty accruals are reevaluated periodically in light of actual experience and  when appropriate  the accruals are adjusted 
our determination of the appropriate level of warranty accrual is subjective  and based on estimates 
the industries in which we operate are subject to rapid technological change 
as a result  we periodically introduce newer  more complex products  which tend to result in increased warranty costs 
we expect the industries in which we operate to continue to require the introduction of new technologies  which could cause our warranty costs to increase in the future 
should product failure rates differ from our estimates  actual costs could vary significantly from our expectations 
fair value of derivative instruments we have entered into various foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate our foreign currency exposure from foreign currency denominated trade purchases and intercompany receivables and payables 
these derivative instruments are not held for trading or speculative purposes 
the valuation of derivative instruments under sfas no 
requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments 
fair value of our derivatives is determined relative to changes in the forward yield curves and discount rates 
such amounts are subject to significant estimates which may change in the future 
commitments and contingencies we are involved in disputes and legal actions arising in the normal course of our business 
while we currently believe that the amount of any ultimate potential loss would not be material to our financial position  the outcome of these actions is inherently difficult to predict 
in the event of an adverse outcome  the ultimate potential loss could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or reported results of operations in a particular quarter 
an unfavorable decision  particularly in patent litigation  could require material changes in production processes and products or result in our inability to ship products or components found to have violated third party patent rights 
we accrue loss contingencies in connection with our litigation when it is probable that a loss has occurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue upon shipment of our products and spare parts  at which time title passes to the customer  as our shipping terms are fob shipping point  the price is fixed and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we do not generate revenue from the installation of our products 
in certain instances we require our customers to pay for a portion or all of their purchases prior to our building or shipping the products 
we record cash payments received prior to shipment as customer deposits in the accompanying balance sheets  then recognize revenue upon shipment of the products 
we do not offer price protections to our customers or allow returns  unless covered by our normal policy for repair of defective products 
we have an arrangement with one of our major customers  a semiconductor capital equipment manufacturer  in which completed products are shipped to the customer and held by them in their warehouse 
the customer draws products from this inventory as 
table of contents needed  at which time title passes to the customer and we recognize revenue 
the customer is subject to our normal warranty policy for repair of defective products 
in certain instances we deliver products to customers for evaluation purposes 
in these arrangements  the customer retains the products for specified periods of time without commitment to purchase 
on or before the expiration of the evaluation period  the customer either rejects the product  and returns it to us  or accepts the product 
upon acceptance  title passes to the customer  we invoice the customer for the product  and revenue is recognized 
pending acceptance by the customer  such systems are reported on our balance sheet at an estimated value based on the lower of cost or market  and are included in the amounts for demonstration and customer service equipment  net of accumulated depreciation 
while we maintain a stringent credit approval process  significant judgments are made by management in connection with assessing our customers ability to pay at the time of shipment 
despite this assessment  from time to time  our customers are unable to meet their payment obligations 
we continue to monitor our customers credit worthiness  and use our judgment in establishing the estimated amounts of customer receivables which will ultimately not be collected 
a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of our customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectibility of our accounts receivable and our future operating results 
stock based compensation as allowed by sfas no 
 we have elected to continue to account for our employee stock based compensation plans using the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  which do not require compensation expense to be recorded if the consideration to be received is at least equal to the fair value of the common stock to be received at the measurement date 
we provide information as to what our earnings and earnings per share would have been had we used the fair value method prescribed by sfas no 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and long term debt obligations 
we generally place our investments with high credit quality issuers and by policy are averse to principal loss and seek to protect and preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
as of december   our investments in marketable securities consisted primarily of commercial paper  municipal and state bonds and notes and institutional money markets 
these securities are highly liquid 
earnings on our marketable securities are typically invested into similar securities 
in  the rates we earned on our marketable securities approximated on a before tax equivalent basis 
because the federal reserve repeatedly lowered interest rates throughout and  
table of contents the interest rates we earn on our investments likewise decreased substantially 
this  in conjunction with using our available cash and cash reserves for acquisitions  including the emco acquisition in january  the aera acquisition in january  the dressler acquisition in march  and the repurchase of a portion of our convertible subordinated notes in the fourth quarter of  has greatly reduced our recent and anticipated interest income 
the impact on interest income of a decrease in the average interest rate would have resulted in approximately  less interest income in   in and million in the interest rates on our subordinated debt are fixed  specifically  at for the million of our debt due november  and at for the million of our debt that is due september our offerings of subordinated debt in and increased our fixed interest expense upon each issuance  though interest expense was partially reduced by the repurchase of a portion of these offerings in and because these rates are fixed  we believe there is no risk of increased interest expense 
the interest rates on our aera japan subsidiary s million credit lines are variable and currently range from to 
we believe a increase in the average interest rate on these instruments would not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we transact business in various foreign countries 
our primary foreign currency cash flows are generated in countries in asia and europe 
during  the us dollar weakened approximately against the japanese yen and against the euro 
it is highly uncertain how currency exchange rates will fluctuate in the future 
we have entered into various forward foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate against currency fluctuations in the japanese yen 
we will continue to evaluate various methods to minimize the effects of currency fluctuations when we translate the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars 
at december   we held a foreign currency forward exchange contract in the us to mitigate the currency fluctuations from our billion yen intercompany receivable due from our subsidiary  ae japan 
under this contract we will sell japanese yen with dollar equivalent notional amounts of approximately million  which at december  had market settlement amounts of approximately million for an unrealized gain position of approximately million 
in japan  we held foreign currency forward exchange contracts to sell us dollars with notional amounts of million and market settlement amounts of approximately million for an unrealized loss position of approximately million and contracts to purchase us dollars with notional amounts of million and market settlement amounts of approximately million for an unrealized loss position of approximately million 

table of contents other risk we have invested in start up companies and strategic alliances and may in the future make additional investments in such companies that develop products which we believe may provide future benefits 
we have written down the cost of one such investment in and  related to a strategic alliance we started in such current investments and any future investments will be subject to all of the risks inherent in investing in companies that are not established  or in which  due to our level of investment  we do not exercise significant management control
