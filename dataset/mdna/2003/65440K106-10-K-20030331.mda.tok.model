item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following management s discussion and analysis should be read in connection with item selected financial data  and item financial statements and supplementary data 
general cents only stores has increased its net sales  operating income and income from continuing operations in each of the last five years 
in  it had net sales of million  operating income of million and income from continuing operations of million  representing a  and increase over  respectively 
from through  the company had a compound annual growth rate in net sales  operating income and income from continuing operations of  and  respectively 
during the three years in the period ending december   average net sales per estimated saleable square foot computed on cents only stores open for a full year declined from per square foot to per square foot 
this trend reflects the company s determination to target larger locations for new store development 
existing stores average approximately  gross square feet 
from january  through december   the company opened new stores including one relocation in that average approximately  gross square feet 
the company currently targets new store locations between  and  gross square feet 
although it is the company s experience that larger stores generally have lower average net sales per square foot than smaller stores  larger stores generally achieve higher average annual store revenues and operating income 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported earnings 
these estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an on going basis and are based on historical experience and on other factors that management believes are reasonable 
estimates and assumptions include  but are not limited to  the areas of customer receivables  inventories  self insurance reserves  and commitments and contingencies 
the company believes that the following represent the areas where more critical estimates and assumptions are used in the preparation of the financial statements investments the company records its investments  which are comprised primarily of investment grade federal and municipal bonds and commercial paper  at fair value 
any premium or discount recognized in connection with the purchase of an investment is amortized over the term of the investment 
the company accounts for its investments in marketable securities in accordance with financial accounting standards board no 
as trading securities 
long lived asset impairment the company records impairments when the carrying amounts of long lived assets are determined not to be recoverable 
impairment is assessed and measured by an estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
changes in market conditions can impact estimated future cash flows from use of these assets and additional impairments may be required should such changes occur 
self insurance reserves the company is self insured in relation to worker s compensation claims in california 
the company provides for losses of estimated known and incurred but not reported insurance claims 
these estimates are based on reported claims and actuarial valuations 
should a greater amount of claims occur compared to the estimates  reserves recorded may not be sufficient and additional expenses  which may be significant  could be incurred 
universal international discontinued operations in december  the company determined it would be in its best interest  and that of its shareholders  to focus its efforts on increasing the growth rate of cents only stores 
in conjunction with its revised growth strategy  the company decided to sell its universal international  inc and odd s n end s  inc subsidiaries together universal 
universal operated a multi price point variety chain  with stores located in the midwest  texas and new york  under the trade names only deals and odd s n end s 
among other factors at that time  the company considered its successful opening of its first cents only stores outside the state of california  in las vegas  nevada 
given the success of the las vegas  nevada stores  the company believed that the cents only stores concept was portable to areas outside the state of california 
as a result  the company has focused greater management resources to increasing its store growth rate and has expanded more rapidly in nevada and arizona and will be expanding into texas in the company adopted a definitive plan to sell universal within one year  as set forth by guidelines for the accounting treatment of discontinued operations 
the company engaged an investment banking firm to evaluate and identify potential buyers for the universal business and expected to sell universal within the one year time frame 
the investment banking firm s marketing process focused upon selling the business as a going concern 
from june through august  sales presentations were delivered to both strategic buyers and financial buyers 
this process did not generate the expected interest level from potential buyers that had been anticipated 
the highest offer for the universal business was significantly less than the company s expectations 
as a result of the difficulties encountered in trying to sell universal and the necessity to complete the process by december   it was decided by the board of directors to be in the company s and the shareholders best interest to sell universal for the company s carrying value as of the close of business on september  to universal deals  inc and universal odd s n end s  inc  both of which are owned by david and sherry gold  both significant shareholders of cents only stores 
mr 
gold is also chairman and ceo of cents only stores 
the sale was effective as of the close of business on september  the purchase price for universal was paid in cash and was equal to the company s carrying book value of the assets of universal at september  or million 
the net assets at september  included million in inventory  net fixed assets of million and million of other assets 
these assets were offset by million of accounts payable  accrued and other liabilities 
in connection with this transaction  cents only stores provided certain ongoing administrative services to universal in and pursuant to a service agreement for a management fee of of universal sales revenues 
during fiscal year  the company recorded an additional net loss from discontinued operations of million  net of tax benefit of million  for operating losses incurred through the date of sale  in excess of the amounts originally provided in in the fourth quarter of  the company received million in management fees under the service agreement with universal 
the company also received million in lease payments for rental of a distribution facility to universal 
during  the company received million in fees under the service agreement  million in lease payments and sold million in merchandise at a mark up 
in the company received million in management fees under the service agreement from universal and million in lease payments 
it also purchased million of closeout inventory from universal 
resolution of universal post closing business issues has required the extension of the service agreement and lease arrangement with cents only stores to a date ending some time in the following table sets forth for the periods indicated  certain selected income statement data  including such data as a percentage of net sales years ended december amounts in thousands net sales cents only stores

the company s capital requirements result primarily from purchases of inventory  expenditures related to new store openings and working capital requirements for new and existing stores 
the company takes advantage of close out and other special situation opportunities  which frequently result in large volume purchases  and as a consequence  its cash requirements are not constant or predictable during the year and can be affected by the timing and size of its purchases 
net cash provided by operations during and was and million  respectively  consisting primarily of million and million of net income adjusted for non cash items

seasonality and quarterly fluctuations the company has historically experienced and expects to continue to experience some seasonal fluctuations in its net sales  operating income and net income 
the highest sales periods for the company are the christmas and halloween seasons 
a greater amount of the company s net sales and operating and net income is generally realized during the fourth quarter

risk factors inflation may affect our ability to sell merchandise at the cents price point the company s ability to provide quality merchandise at the cents price point is subject to certain economic factors  which are beyond the company s control  including inflation 
inflation could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations  especially given the constraints on the company to pass on any incremental costs due to price increases or other factors 
the company believes that it will be able to respond to ordinary price increases resulting from inflationary pressures by adjusting the number of items sold at the single price point eg  two items for cents instead of three items for cents and by changing its selection of merchandise 
nevertheless  a sustained trend of significantly increased inflationary pressure could require the company to abandon its single price point of cents per item  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
see also we are vulnerable to uncertain economic factors and changes in the minimum wage for a discussion of additional risks attendant to inflationary conditions 
we depend on new store openings for future growth our operating results depend largely on our ability to open and operate new stores successfully and to manage a larger business profitably 
in  and  we opened  and cents only stores  respectively  and stores respectively  net of relocated stores 
as of march   we opened three stores and expect to open additional stores during the remainder of to meet a growth rate of 
we also plan to grow retail square footage at a rate of approximately per year 
our strategy depends on many factors  including our ability to identify suitable markets and sites for our new stores  negotiate leases with acceptable terms  refurbish stores  upgrade our financial and management information systems and controls and manage our operating expenses 
in addition  we must be able to continue to hire  train  motivate and retain competent managers and store personnel 
many of these factors are beyond our control 
as a result  we cannot assure you that we will be able to achieve our expansion goals 
any failure by us to achieve our expansion goals on a timely basis  obtain acceptance in markets in which we currently have limited or no presence  attract and retain management and other qualified personnel  appropriately upgrade our financial and management information systems and control or manage operating expenses could adversely affect our future operating results and our ability to execute our business strategy 
we also cannot assure you that we will improve our results of operations when we open new stores 
a variety of factors  including store location  store size  rental terms  the level of store sales and the level of initial advertising influence if and when a store becomes profitable 
assuming that our planned expansion occurs as anticipated  our store base will include a relatively high proportion of stores with relatively short operating histories 
we cannot assure you that our new stores will achieve the sales per saleable square foot and store level operating margins currently achieved at our existing stores 
if our new stores on average fail to achieve these results  our planned expansion could produce a decrease in our overall sales per saleable square foot and store level operating margins 
increases in the level of advertising and pre opening expenses associated with the opening of new stores could also contribute to a decrease in our operating margins 
finally  the opening of new stores in existing markets has in the past and may in the future reduce retail sales of existing stores in those markets  negatively affecting comparable store sales 
our operations are concentrated in california currently  all but of our cents only stores are located in california 
the company operates nine stores in las vegas  nevada and stores in arizona 
the company expects that it will continue to open additional stores in california  as well as in nevada  arizona and texas 
accordingly  our results of operations and financial condition largely depend upon trends in the california economy 
if retail spending declines due to economic slow down or recession in california  we cannot assure you that our operations will not be negatively impacted 
in addition  california historically has been vulnerable to certain natural disasters and other risks  such as earthquakes  fires  floods and civil disturbance 
at times  these events have disrupted the local economy 
these events could also pose physical risks to our properties 
we could experience disruptions in receiving and distribution our success depends upon whether our receiving and shipment schedules are organized and well managed 
as we continue to grow  we may face unexpected demands on our warehouse operations  as well as unexpected demands on our transportation network  which could cause delays in delivery of merchandise to or from our warehouses to our stores 
a fire  earthquake or other disaster at our warehouses could hurt our business  financial condition and results of operations  particularly because much of our merchandise consists of closeouts and other irreplaceable products 
although we maintain standard property and business interruption insurance  we do not have earthquake insurance on our properties 
although we try to limit our risk of exposure to potential product liability claims  we do not know if the limitations in our agreements are enforceable 
we maintain insurance covering damage from use of our products 
if any product liability claim is successful and large enough  our business could suffer 
we depend upon our relationships with our suppliers and the availability of close out and special situation merchandise our success depends in large part on our ability to locate and purchase quality close out and special situation merchandise at attractive prices 
this helps us maintain a mix of name brand and other merchandise at the cents price point 
we cannot be certain that such merchandise will continue to be available in the future 
further  we may not be able to find and purchase merchandise in quantities necessary to accommodate our growth 
additionally  our suppliers sometimes restrict the advertising  promotion and method of distribution of their merchandise 
these restrictions in turn may make it more difficult for us to quickly sell these items from our inventory 
although we believe our relationships with our suppliers are good  we do not have long term agreements with any supplier 
as a result  we must continuously seek out buying opportunities from our existing suppliers and from new sources 
we compete for these opportunities with other wholesalers and retailers  discount and deep discount chains  mass merchandisers  food markets  drug chains  club stores and various privately held companies and individuals 
although we do not depend on any single supplier or group of suppliers and believe we can successfully compete in seeking out new suppliers  a disruption in the availability of merchandise at attractive prices could impair our business 
we purchase in large volumes and our inventory is highly concentrated to obtain inventory at attractive prices  we take advantage of large volume purchases  close outs and other special situations 
as a result  our inventory levels are generally higher than other discount retailers 
at december   and  we recorded net inventory of million  million and million respectively 
we periodically review the net realizable value of our inventory and make adjustments to its carrying value when appropriate 
the current carrying value of our inventory reflects our belief that we will realize the net values recorded on our balance sheet 
however  we may not be able to do so 
if we sell large portions of our inventory at amounts less than their carrying value or if we write down a significant part of our inventory  our cost of sales  gross profit  operating income and net income could suffer greatly during the period in which such event or events occur 
we face strong competition we compete in both the acquisition of inventory and sale of merchandise with other wholesalers  discount and deep discount stores  single price point merchandisers  mass merchandisers  food markets  drug chains  club stores and other retailers 
our industry competitors also include many privately held companies and individuals 
at times  these competitors are also customers of our bargain wholesale division 
in the future  new companies may also enter the deep discount retail industry 
additionally  we currently face increasing competition for the purchase of quality close out and other special situation merchandise 
some of our competitors have substantially greater financial resources and buying power than us 
our capability to compete will depend on many factors including our ability to successfully purchase and resell merchandise at lower prices than our competitors 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors 
we are vulnerable to uncertain economic factors  changes in the minimum wage and workers compensation our ability to provide quality merchandise at our cents price point could be hindered by certain economic factors beyond our control  including but not limited to increases in inflation  increases in operating costs  increases in employee health care costs  increases in workers compensation benefits  increases in prevailing wage levels  and decreases in consumer confidence levels 
in january  california enacted a minimum wage increase of per hour with an additional increase required in january in and  annual payroll expenses as a percentage of sales increased less than 
because we provide consumers with merchandise at a cents fixed price point  we typically cannot pass on cost increases to our customers 
we face risks associated with international sales and purchases although international sales historically have not been important to our overall net sales  they have contributed to historical growth in bargain wholesale s net sales 
in addition  some of the inventory we purchase is manufactured outside the united states 
there are many risks associated with doing business internationally 
our international transactions may be subject to risks such as political instability  currency fluctuations  exchange rate controls  changes in import and export regulations  and changes in tariff and freight rates 
the united states and other countries have also proposed various forms of protectionist trade legislation 
any resulting changes in current tariff structures or other trade policies could lead to fewer purchases of our products and could adversely affect our international operations 
we could encounter risks related to transactions with our affiliates we currently lease of our cents only stores and a parking lot for one of these stores from certain members of the gold family and their affiliates 
our annual rental expense for these facilities totaled approximately  and million in each of  and in addition  one of our directors  ben schwartz  is a trustee of a trust that owns a property on which a single cents only store is located 
we believe that our lease terms are just as favorable to us as they would be for an unrelated party 
under our current policy  we enter into real estate transactions with our affiliates only for the renewal or modification of existing leases and on occasions where we determine that such transactions are in our best interests 
moreover  the independent members of our board of directors must unanimously approve all real estate transactions between the company and our affiliates 
they must also determine that such transactions are equivalent to a negotiated arm s length transaction with a third party 
we cannot guarantee that we will reach agreements with the gold family on renewal terms for the properties we currently lease from them 
also  even if we agree to such terms  we cannot be certain that our independent directors will approve them 
if we fail to renew one of these leases  we could be forced to relocate or close the leased store 
any relocations or closures we experience will be costly and could adversely affect our business 
we rely heavily on our management team our success depends substantially on david gold and eric schiffer  our chief executive officer and president  respectively 
we also rely on the continued service of our executive officers and other key management 
we have not entered into employment agreements with any of our executive officers and we do not maintain key person life insurance on them 
as we continue to grow  our success will depend on our ability to identify  attract  hire  train  retain and motivate other highly skilled management personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  and we may not be able to successfully attract  assimilate or retain sufficiently qualified candidates 
our operating results may fluctuate and may be affected by seasonal buying patterns historically  our highest net sales and operating income have occurred during the fourth quarter  which includes the christmas and halloween selling seasons 
during and  we generated approximately and  respectively  of our net sales and approximately and  respectively  of our operating income during the fourth quarter 
if for any reason the company s net sales were to fall below norms during the fourth quarter it could have an adverse impact on our profitability and impair our results of operations for the entire year 
adverse weather conditions or other disruptions during the peak holiday season could also affect our net sales and profitability for the year 
in addition to seasonality  many other factors may cause our results of operations to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
some of these factors are beyond our control 
these factors include the number of new stores and timing of new store openings  the level of advertising and pre opening expenses associated with new stores  the integration of new stores into our operations  general economic health of the deep discount retail industry  changes in the mix of products sold  unexpected increases in shipping costs  ability to successfully manage our inventory levels  changes in our personnel  fluctuations in the amount of consumer spending  the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to the growth of our business 
we are subject to environmental regulations under various federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations  current or previous owners or occupants of property may become liable for the costs of removing any hazardous substances found on the property 
these laws and regulations often impose liability without regard to fault 
as of december   we leased all but of our stores 
we own our main warehouse and distribution facility where our executive offices are located 
however  in the future we may be required to incur substantial costs for preventive or remedial measures associated with the presence of hazardous materials 
in addition  we operate one underground diesel storage tank and one above ground propane storage tank at our warehouse 
although we have not been notified of  and are not aware of  any current environmental liability  claim or non compliance  we could incur costs in the future related to our leased properties and our storage tanks 
in the ordinary course of our business  we sometimes handle or dispose of commonplace household products that are classified as hazardous materials under various environmental laws and regulations

anti takeover effect  concentration of ownership by our existing officers and principal stockholders in addition to some governing provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws  we are also subject to certain california laws and regulations which could delay  discourage or prevent others from initiating a potential merger  takeover or other change in our control  even if such actions would benefit our shareholders and us 
moreover david gold  our chairman and chief executive officer  and members of his immediate family and certain of their affiliates beneficially own as of december    or of shares outstanding 
as a result  they have the ability to influence all matters requiring the vote of our shareholders  including the election of our directors and most of our corporate actions 
they can also control our policies and potentially prevent a change in our control 
this could adversely affect the voting and other rights of our other shareholders and could depress the market price of our common stock 
our stock price could fluctuate widely the market price of our common stock has risen substantially since our initial public offering on may  trading prices for our common stock could fluctuate significantly due to many factors  including the depth of the market for our common stock  changes in expectations of our future financial performance  including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors  variations in our operating results  conditions or trends in our industry or in the industries of any of our significant clients  the conditions of the market generally  additions or departures of key personnel  and future sales of our common stock 
risks could arise due to our use of arthur andersen llp as our independent auditors you may have no effective remedy against arthur andersen llp  which audited our financial statements included in this report for the years ended december  and  in connection with a material misstatement or omission in these financial statements  or in connection with any other claim arising from its provision of auditing and other services to us 
on june   arthur andersen was convicted of obstructing justice in connection with investigations of their former client enron corp 
arthur andersen ceased practicing befor the securities and exchange commission sec effective august  our inability to include in future registration statements or reports financial statements for one or more years audited by arthur andersen llp or to obtain arthur andersen llp s consent to the inclusion of their report on our and financial statements may impede our access to the capital markets 
should we seek to access the public capital markets  sec rules will require us to include or incorporate by reference in any prospectus three years of audited financial statements 
until our audited financial statements for the fiscal year ending december  become available  the sec s current rules would require us to present audited financial statements for one or more fiscal years audited by arthur andersen llp 
prior to that time the sec may cease accepting financial statements audited by arthur andersen llp  in which case we would be unable to access the public capital markets unless pricewaterhousecoopers llp  our current independent accounting firm  or another independent accounting firm  is able to audit the financial statements originally audited by arthur andersen llp 
in addition  as a result of the departure of our former engagement team leaders  arthur andersen llp is no longer in a position to consent to the inclusion or incorporation by reference in any prospectus of their report on our audited financial statements for the years ended december  and december   and investors in any subsequent offerings for which we use their audit report will not be entitled to recovery against them under section of the securities act of for any material misstatements or omissions in those financial statements 
consequently  our financing costs may increase or we may miss attractive market opportunities if either our annual financial statements for and audited by arthur andersen llp should cease to satisfy the sec s requirements or those statements are used in a prospectus but investors are not entitled to recovery against our auditors for material misstatements or omissions in them
