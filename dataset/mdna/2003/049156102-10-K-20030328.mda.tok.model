critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
note to our consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of these financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements also requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  our management evaluates these estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  intangible assets  bad debts and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable we recognize revenue upon shipment of our products to customers  giving consideration to product shipping terms 
receivables are currently due from customers based on negotiated payment terms 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded based on specific review and analysis of customer account balances 
the allowance for sales returns is recorded based on management s estimate of product returns  primarily based on historical trends 
we perform ongoing credit assessments of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history  the customer s current credit worthiness and any other relevant customer specific credit information 
while historical credit losses have been within our expectations and the provisions established  it is possible that future credit losses could be higher or lower in the future 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
cost includes materials  labor and overhead 
market  with respect to all inventories  is replacement cost or net realizable value 
management frequently reviews inventory to determine the necessity of reserves for excess  obsolete or unsaleable inventory 
these reviews require management to assess customer and market demand 
these estimates may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have overstated or understated the reserve required for excess  obsolete or unsaleable inventory 
goodwill in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations sfas  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas prospectively prohibits the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations initiated after june  sfas requires companies to cease amortizing goodwill that existed at december  and establishes a new method for testing goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  or an interim basis if an event occurs that might reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
any goodwill resulting from acquisitions completed after june  will not be amortized 
sfas also requires that an identifiable intangible asset which is determined to have an indefinite useful economic life not be amortized  but be separately tested for impairment using a fair value based approach 
we adopted sfas effective january  resulting in a decrease in amortization expense of approximately million during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  
table of contents we review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or on an interim basis if an event occurs that might reduce the fair value of the goodwill below its carrying value 
an impairment loss would be recognized based on the difference between the carrying value of the asset and its estimated fair value  which would be determined based on either discounted future cash flows or other appropriate fair value methods 
specifically  we have net goodwill  which represents the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities of acquired businesses  of million 
accumulated amortization aggregated million at december  and based upon our analysis  we have determined there has been no impairment to goodwill as of december  in accordance with sfas although we currently believe that the estimates used in the evaluation of goodwill are reasonable  differences between actual and expected revenue  operating results  and cash flow could cause these assets to be deemed impaired 
if this were to occur  we would be required to charge to earnings the write down in value of such assets  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 
self insurance we are self insured for the majority of our group health insurance costs  subject to specific retention levels 
the reserve for health insurance claims incurred but not paid is based on historical claims lags 
in addition  we are self insured for the majority of our worker s compensation costs 
we establish reserves for worker s compensation claims utilizing insurance industry loss development factors as well as specific estimates of settlement costs for individual claims 
while we believe that our assumptions our appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may have a material affect on our group health insurance and worker s compensation costs

 accounting for the cost associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
this statement applies to all exit or disposal activities initiated after december  and requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
examples of costs covered by the standard include lease termination costs and certain employee severance costs that are associated with a restructuring  discontinued operation  plant closing  or other exit or disposal activity

 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  to provide alternative methods of transition to the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
the three methods provided in sfas include the prospective method which is the method currently provided for in sfas  the retroactive method which would allow companies to restate all periods presented and the modified prospective method which would allow companies to present the recognition provisions to all outstanding stock based employee compensation instruments as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption 
in addition  sfas amends the disclosure provisions of sfas to require disclosure in the summary of significant accounting policies of the effects of an entity s accounting policy with respect to stock based employee compensation on reported net income and earnings per share in annual and interim financial statements 
sfas does not amend sfas to require companies to account for their employee stock based awards using the fair value method 
however  the disclosure provisions are required for all companies with stock based employee compensation  regardless of whether they utilize the fair value method of accounting described in sfas or the intrinsic value method described in apb opinion no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks that may impact our financial condition and financial results due to changing interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
we do not participate in any significant hedging activities  nor do we currently utilize any significant derivative financial instruments 
the following discussion provides additional information regarding our market risks 
interest rate risk we have entered into variable rate debt that  at december   had an outstanding balance of million 
as of december   we had of outstanding variable rate debt 
based on our variable rate obligations outstanding at december   and december   each basis point increase or decrease in the level of interest rates would  respectively  increase or decrease our annual interest expense and related cash payments by approximately million  and million  respectively 
such potential increases or decreases are based on certain simplifying assumptions  including a constant level of variable rate debt for all maturities and an immediate  across the board increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period 
in prior filings  we used a tabular format to disclose our interest rate market risk 
we changed to a sensitivity analysis at december  as it better quantifies the risk inherent in interest rate markets 
foreign exchange rate risk we have a canadian dollar bank account and therefore are exposed to foreign exchange currency market risk 
we have determined this risk to be immaterial at both december  and december  due to the small balance in that account
