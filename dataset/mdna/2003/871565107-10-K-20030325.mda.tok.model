item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under differ ent assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
a significant portion of the company s accounts receivable in the colors segment are from domestic customers in the textile industry  which has been in a steady decline over the last several years 
if the financial condition of these or any other customers of the company were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and current market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
as with the accounts receivable  a significant portion of the company s inventories in the colors segment are used by domestic customers in the textile industry 
in addition  most of the key raw materials are imported from asian countries causing the company to maintain significant amounts of inventory for certain products in order to adequately service the colors segment s customers 
if the financial condition of these customers were to deteriorate  resulting in the elimination or reduction of their demand for our products  additional inventory write downs may be required 
as noted in note i to consolidated financial statements  the company has accrued  in environmental remediation costs which  in management s best estimate  will satisfy anticipated costs of known remediation requirements as outlined in note i 
as a result of the evolving nature of the environmental regulations  the difficulty in estimating the extent and remedy of environmental contamination  and the availability and application of technology  the estimated costs for future environmental compliance and remediation are subject to uncertainties and it is not possible to predict the amount or timing of future costs of environmental matters which may subsequently be determined 
subject to the difficulty in estimating future environmental costs  the company believes that the likelihood of material losses in excess of the amounts recorded is remote 
however  any changes  including regulatory changes  may require the company to record additional remediation reserves 
liquidity and capital resources the current ratio at year end was which is up from the previous year end ratios of in and in working capital decreased  to  cash flows from operations  totaling  were derived primarily from declines in inventories of  and  in tax refunds received in related to  offset by the net loss incurred totaling  before depreciation and amortization expense of  and  of environmental remediation costs paid in the decline in inventories came primarily from planned reductions in the metals and colors segments 
the company also generated  of cash from the sale of non operating investments and under utilized property  plant and equipment 
cash flows were used to reduce debt by  and make capital expenditures of  the company expects that cash flows from operations and available borrowings will be sufficient to make debt payments and fund estimated capital expenditures of  and normal operating requirements 
on july   the company entered into a new credit agreement with a new bank to provide a  line of credit expiring on july   and refinanced the company s notes payable and long term debt replacing the existing bank indebtedness 
although the line of credit does not expire until  the company anticipates reducing the amount owed under the line of credit to approximately  over the next twelve months and has therefore classified  as a current liability 
borrowings under the agreement are limited to a borrowing base calculation including eligible accounts receivable  inventories  and cash surrender value of the company s life insurance as defined in the agreement 
as of december   the amount available for borrowing was  of which  was borrowed leaving  of availability 
covenants include  among others  restrictions on the payment of divide nds 
results of operations consolidated sales were down for  decreasing six percent from the same period one year ago  as the company incurred a loss for of

this compares to a loss of

for the fourth quarter of  the company had a profit of  on a percent increase in sales to  this compares to a loss of  in the last quarter of consolidated operating results for were significantly impacted by several transactions that were recorded during the year 
in the second quarter of  the company recorded charges discussed in the segment comparisons below totaling  net of tax  or

the company sold certain non operating assets during  including its investments in equity securities  for an after tax gain of  or

metals segment the following table summarizes operating results and backlogs for the three years indicated 
reference should be made to note r to the consolidated financial statements 
dollar amounts in thousands amount amount amount net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling and administrative expense operating loss income special charges described below write down of inventories plant closure costs environmental remediation costs year end backlog piping systems comparison of to metals segment dollar sales for the year were down eight percent as the result of an percent average decline in sales prices offset by a twelve percent increase in unit volumes 
extremely competitive market conditions  together with a change in product mix  with a lower percentage of sales coming from higher priced fabricated piping systems  led to the fall in average selling prices 
the increase in volume came primarily from the increase in sales of lower margin smaller diameter commodity pipe 
the market conditions  together with the change in product mix had a significant effect on profits as the segment incurred an operating loss of  for compared to operating income of  in also contributing to the loss was the recording of a  charge in the second quarter of to write down inventory 
the company has historically sold off excess inventory slowly to avoid distressed pricing that would be required to dispose of the excess inventory more quickly 
with the price erosion that occurred over the first six months of the year and weak business conditions that existed  excess inventories were not reduced as much as planned 
most of the inventory write down was the result of excess inventories of fittings  flanges and special alloy pipe related to the piping systems business 
the unexpectedly low level of new orders impacted piping systems products to the extent that use of some of this inventory became uncertain 
therefore  excess inventories were written down to reflect management s estimate of the values that could be realized under a plan to scrap  sell or return the excess inventory as quickly as feasible 
although fabricated piping systems volume was down for the year  it improved slightly in the fourth quarter compared to the first three quarters of this year 
management achieved modest success in obtaining non stainless projects for fabricated piping systems during with most of the fourth quarter s sales coming from non stainless projects 
however  projects requiring stainless steel pipe  which is provided by the segment s pipe manufacturing plant  were significantly below prior years levels 
this reduction in volume through the pipe manufacturing plant impacted the absorption of operating costs which also contributed to the lack of profitability by the segment for the year 
selling and administrative expense decreased  or five percent 
however  it increased slightly as a percent of sales compared to last year as a result of the decline in sales in compared to beginning in september  cost reductions  including reductions of personnel and non critical operating expense items  were implemented many of which impacted selling and administrative expense 
as a result  selling and administrative expense for the fourth quarter of declined to  or six percent of sales as compared to  or nine percent of sales for the same period last year 
comparison of to metals segment dollar sales for were down percent from as the result of percent lower unit volumes coupled with a percent average decline in sales prices 
a change in product mix  with a lower percentage of sales coming from higher priced fabricated piping systems  led to about half of the fall in average selling prices 
the other half of the reduction in sales resulted from lower prices for raw materials and the generally competitive market conditions 
the unit volume decline was more than accounted for during the first half of the year when was characterized by weak markets and some inventory liquidation while the first six months of set record highs in unit volumes as the result of significant inventory building by our customers ahead of price increases 
operating income for was down percent from the prior year level 
during most of  our selling prices were in an uptrend and end use demand was enhanced by inventory building during the first half of t he year 
these generally favorable conditions  together with substantial gross profit increases from the rising prices  produced good profit margins 
unfortunately  was the mirror image of our selling prices trended downward during all of  leading to substantial gross profit declines 
we estimate that raw material costs charged to cost of goods sold were approximately  more than our replacement costs during the year 
in addition  reduced demand led to more intense competition  which put further pressure on profit margins 
selling and administrative expense decreased  or percent in however  it increased as a percent of sales to eight percent from seven percent compared to the prior year 
the significant decline in sales in compared to was greater than the corresponding decline in sales commissions and other selling and administrative costs over the same periods

chemicals group the following tables summarize operating results for the three years indicated 
reference should be made to note r to consolidated financial statements 
colors segment dollar amounts in thousands amount amount amount net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling and administrative expense long lived asset impairment cost environmental remediation costs operating loss special charges described below write down of inventories write down of plant and equipment environmental remediation costs specialty chemicals segment dollar amounts in thousands amount amount amount net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling and administrative expense long lived asset impairment cost operating income loss special charges described below write down of plant and equipment augusta operating and closure costs chemicals group dollar amounts in thousands amount amount amount net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling and administrative expense long lived asset impairment and environmental remediation costs operating loss comparison of to colors segment sales declined percent for the year from the same period last year reflecting the continuing contraction of the textile industry 
the operating loss for occurred primarily from the recording of an impairment charge of  described below  an inventory charge of  and an environmental charge of  all recorded in the second quarter of the poor sales performance also contributed to the loss  as market conditions continued to be extremely competitive impacting margins and creating unabsorbed operating costs 
the segment implemented an aggressive inventory reduction program in the first two quarters of which also impacted profitability 
as previously stated  the company has historically sold off excess inventory slowly to avoid distressed pricing that would be required to dispose of the excess inventory more quickly 
with the price erosion that occurred over the first six months of the year and weak business conditions that existed  excess in ventories were not reduced as much as planned and the inventory charge was recorded 
sales demand had shown limited improvement in the third quarter and first half of the fourth quarter of in addition  cost reductions implemented at the beginning of september  including reductions of personnel and non critical operating expense items had a positive impact on the last half of the year 
however  the improved sales activity diminished over the last half of the fourth quarter 
the reduced sales volume caused the segment to incur an operating loss for the fourth quarter 
the loss was disappointing since the segment had  of operating profit for the third quarter of after four consecutive quarters of operating losses 
the segment was able to generate  of cash flow for  resulting primarily from the inventory reduction program 
selling and administrative expense for totaled  which is  below the prior year s amount primarily as a result of the cost reductions discussed previously 
however  selling and administrative expense as a percent of sales was percent which was one percent above the prior year s percentage due to the significant decline in sales 
the spartanburg plant  which includes the colors segment dye business and part of the specialty chemicals segment s operations  was substantially under utilized and generating operating losses  primarily because of deteriorating market conditions 
the segments were able to minimize the operating losses for these operations through the first quarter of and business plans for this facility showed positive cash flows for these operations going forward 
although the colors segment experienced a significant decline of textile dye sales in the first quarter of  management believed that this situation was temporary and seasonal and would not continue 
indications existed that conditions should improve in the near term  such as increases in month to month sales and sales order activity  supporting the evaluation 
based on historical results and management s projections  the operations were expected to generate positive cash flows and did not support a write down at the end of the first quarter 
although conditions improved slightly during the second quarter  there were sufficient new indications  including the unexpected loss of expected dye business  increases in pricing pressure from competitors  and reductions in expected revenues in the specialty chemicals segment s tolling business  to require management to revise its projections to better reflect what management believed were current market conditions 
after completing an analysis of the businesses  evaluations of the plant and equipment values at the site  completing projected cash flow calculations  and exploring other options that were available  it became apparent that the facility could not adequately recover costs related to the facility under current business conditions 
accordingly  an impairment charge of   related to the colors segment and  to the specialty chemicals segment was recorded in the second quarter of to write down the plant and equipment reflecting the undiscounted cash flow assessments 
for information related to environmental matters  see note i to consolidated financial statements 
comparison of to colors segment the eleven percent decline in colors segment sales in resulted from the relentless and well chronicled downsizing of the domestic textile industry that has been evident since cost cutting efforts moderated the operating loss so that it was only two percent worse than a year earlier before the special charges in outlined in the table above 
the textile industry downsizing has been faster and of greater magnitude than almost anyone forecast 
this made it impossible for us to cut costs and downsize our own colors segment operations fast enough to maintain profitability 
the majority of the decline in sales and operating loss came in the fourth quarter  as sales for the fourth quarter of declined  from the fourth quarter of of the  loss experienced for   occurred in the fourth quarter 
selling and administrative expense for increased  or one percent from the prior year  and increased as a percent of sales primarily from an increase in salary expense 
comparison of to specialty chemicals segment sales were up percent for the year from the same period last year and the segment had operating profits for of  including a  impairment charge as discussed above  compared to an operating loss of  for the improved performance was experienced at both of the segment s locations as both operations ended the year profitable 
several factors  including improved business conditions  increases in toll and other contract business compared to last year  and cost reductions implemented in the third quarter  including reductions of personnel and non critical operating expense items  led to the increase in sales and profits 
these factors were most prevalent in the last six months of as the segment had  of operating income compared to an operating loss of  for the first six months of selling and administrative expense for totaled  which is  above last year s amount primarily as a result of increased selling expenses from the acquisition of the dalton  georgia business in the third quarter of  offset by the cost reductions described above 
selling and administrative expenses as a percent of sales remained consistent at twelve percent for and comparison of to specialty chemicals segment sales in the specialty chemicals segment were down three percent because of generally weak economic conditions and some business lost because of the closure of the augusta  georgia plant 
on the other hand  sales from the acquisition of global chemical resources in july of helped minimize the decline 
the operating loss for was an improvement of percent from the prior year loss before special charges outlined in the table above 
the reduced loss resulted from closing the augusta plant 
the weak economy  which appeared to decline steadily over the last half of  caused sales to reduce to levels causing the segment to incur significant negative manufacturing variances at both of its plants 
this was offset somewhat at the mc cleveland plant in the second half of  when the manufacture of liquid products by the dalton plant was transferred to cleveland in july providing more through put and improving efficiency 
most of the loss   of the  loss fo r  occurred in the fourth quarter 
the mc cleveland plant experienced weaker sales in november and december of coupled with increased operating costs 
due to the timing of certain toll contracts  the mix of products produced at the bu spartanburg plant in the fourth quarter generated lower revenues and profit margins 
the combination of both of these factors caused the decline in profitability 
selling and administrative expense for increased  or percent from the prior year  and increased as a percent of sales as a result of increased selling expenses from the acquisition of the dalton  georgia business in the third quarter of for information related to environmental matters  see note i to consolidated financial statements 
unallocated income and expense reference should be made to note r to consolidated financial statements for the schedule of these items 
comparison of to corporate corporate expense declined  or percent to  for compared to the decline resulted primarily from cost reductions implemented at the beginning of september  including reductions of personnel and non critical operating expense items 
other expense  net in declined  from last year s total 
the company sold certain non operating assets during  including its investment in a foreign corporation  for pre tax gains of  in the company recognized gains from the sale of its whiting plant in camden  south carolina of  and  from the partial sale of one of its investments 
interest expense in decreased  compared to last year from decreases in borrowings under the lines of credit with a bank 
interest income decreased  primarily from interest received in under a metals segment s contract with a customer 
comparison of to corporate corporate expense for declined  or percent to  from the decline resulted primarily from two factors 
included in the special adjustments for is an unexpected  payment made under a contract related to a pre employment matter recorded in the first quarter of in addition   in outside consulting costs was expensed during related to the installation of a new data processing system 
other expense  net declined  as interest expense decreased  from decreases in borrowings and interest rates under the lines of credit with a bank 
the company also recognized gains from the sale of its whiting plant in camden  south carolina of  and  from the partial sale of one of its investments 
interest income increased  primarily from interest received under a metals segment s contract with a customer 
current conditions and outlook metals segment s dollar sales for the fourth quarter of were up six percent as unit volumes increased four percent and sales prices improved two percent compared to the same period last year 
almost all of the volume increase came from lower margin smaller diameter commodity pipe which resulted in the  operating loss experienced for the quarter compared to operating income of  for the same period last year 
the segment achieved modest success in obtaining non stainless projects for fabricated piping systems during with most of the fourth quarter s sales coming from non stainless projects 
however  projects requiring stainless steel pipe  which is provided by the segment s pipe manufacturing plant  were significantly below prior years fourth quarter levels 
this reduction in volume through the pipe manufacturing plant impacted the absorption of operating costs which also contributed to the lack of profitability by the segment for the fourth quarter 
the loss incurred in the quarter was offset somewhat by cost reductions  implemented in september of the poor economy that currently exists has had a significant impact on domestic capital spending and  coupled with the competitive environment that exists in this segment s industry  has made it very difficult to maintain profitability 
sales in december and the first few weeks of have been very weak 
however  order activity appears to be increasing and a price increase  instituted in december  appears to be holding 
in addition  fabricated piping systems backlog has increased percent to  from  much of which requires stainless steel pipe 
although the piping systems backlog increased significantly  the timing of the projects is spread throughout the year and management does not expect to increase piping systems production significantly in the first quarter 
colors segment s sales for the fourth quarter of were percent below the same quarter last year 
even though sales were down  the operating loss experienced in the fourth quarter declined by more than percent from the loss incurred in the same quarter last year 
the improvement in results reflects the cost reductions implemented at the beginning of september although the segment experienced improved sales activity over the last half of  this diminished over the last half of the fourth quarter 
the reduced sales volume caused the segment to incur an operating loss for the fourth quarter 
although the poor sales activity has continued into the first few weeks of  management believes this reflects a seasonal trend and duplicates sales activity that occurred over similar periods last year 
management believes that sales will return to a more normal level before the end of the first quarter and is hopeful that this will provide the opportunity for the segment to improve operating results  although there is no assurance that this will occur 
specialty chemicals segment sales increased percent for the fourth quarter of compared to the same period of the prior year 
several factors  including improved business conditions  increases in toll and other contract business compared to last year  and cost reductions implemented in the third quarter led to the increase in sales and a  operating profit realized in the quarter compared to the  operating loss incurred for the same period last year 
management believes that the existing favorable conditions described above should continue into however  first quarter revenues and profitability have historically been poor for this segment due primarily to the timing of toll and contract work 
the poor economic conditions that currently exist along with the timing of the segment s toll and contract business can have a negative impact on sales and profitability 
management believes the segment is better positioned to minimize this impact  although there i s no assurance that this will occur
