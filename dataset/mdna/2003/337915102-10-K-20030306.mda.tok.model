the objective of this financial review is to enhance the reader s understanding of the accompanying tables and charts  the consolidated financial statements  notes to financial statements  and financial statistics appearing elsewhere in this report 
where applicable  this discussion also reflects management s insights of known events and trends that have or may reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the corporation s operations and financial condition 
all financial data has been restated to give effect to acquisitions accounted for on a pooling of interests basis and stock splits in previous periods 
the results of other bank and branch acquisitions  accounted for as purchases  have been included effective with the respective dates of acquisition

total operating revenue  defined as net interest income on a fully tax equivalent basis plus non interest income  was million for  a increase above the million reported in excluding gains from the sale of securities and the one time pre tax restructuring charge of million in the fourth quarter of associated with the corporation s exit from the manufactured housing business  operating revenue was million in compared with million in  an increase of 
fully tax equivalent net interest income increased to million from million  reflecting the combined impact of a basis point expansion in the net interest margin to  and a increase in average earnings assets to billion 
the corporation continues to experience the impact of the low interest rate environment  fourth quarter net interest income was flat compared to the same period last year despite a increase in average earning assets 
net interest income is more fully discussed in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section of this report 
other non interest income rose to million in  a increase over excluding gains from the sale of securities and the one time restructuring charge of million in  non interest income declined  to million 
the major contributors were a decline in manufactured housing fee income resulting from the discontinuation of manufactured housing loan originations in the fourth quarter of  as well as the impact of a million pre tax impairment charge on mortgaging service rights taken in the third quarter of and the inclusion  in  of a million gain from the sale of a partnership 
the impairment of mortgage servicing rights occurred primarily as a result of lower interest rates which caused higher loan prepayments 
for the fourth quarter of this year  excluding gains from the sale of securities and the one time restructuring charge  non interest income rose boosted by a improvement in investment services and insurance income combined with a improvement in loan sales and servicing income 
other non interest expenses declined to million

net interest income net interest income  the difference between interest and loan fee income on earning assets and the interest paid on deposits and borrowed funds  is the principal source of earnings for the corporation 
throughout this discussion net interest income is presented on a fully taxable equivalent fte basis which restates interest on tax exempt securities and loans as if such interest were subject to federal income tax at the statutory rate 
net interest income is affected by market interest rates on both earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the level of earning assets being funded by interest bearing liabilities  non interest bearing liabilities and equity  
table of contents and the growth in earning assets 
the following table shows the allocation to assets  the source of funding and their respective interest spreads

specifically  interest expense fell million while interest income dropped million 
the overall lower interest rate environment in  compared with the prior year  had the following effect on interest bearing assets and liabilities 
the average yield on earning assets dropped basis points from in to in lowering interest income by million 
higher outstanding balances on total average earning assets caused interest income to increase million from year ago levels 
average balances for investment securities were million higher than last year  but lower rates earned on the securities lessened interest income by million 
average loan outstandings were down slightly from last year while lower yields earned on the loans  decreased loan interest income by million 
the decline in interest expense was primarily rate driven as lower interest rates paid on customer deposits and wholesale borrowings accounted for million  or  of the decrease in interest expense compared to last year 
as discussed in the deposits and wholesale borrowings section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and operating results  the corporation placed less reliance on certificates of deposits cds and wholesale borrowings to fund loans and operations in specifically  lower average outstandings for cds and wholesale borrowings lessened interest expense in by million and million  respectively 
lower interest rates paid on these same instruments caused interest expense to decline million on cds and million on wholesale borrowings 
the cost of funds for the year  as a percentage of average earning assets  decreased from in to in 
table of contents the following table illustrates the specific year over year impact to net interest income based on changes in the rate and volume components of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities

the net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income fte by average earning assets 
as with net interest income  the net interest margin is affected by the level and mix of earning assets  the proportion of earning assets funded by non interest bearing liabilities  and the interest rate spread 
in addition  the net interest margin is impacted by changes in federal income tax rates and regulations as they affect the tax equivalent adjustment 
the net interest margin for was compared to in and in as discussed in the previous section  the increase in the net interest margin during was primarily a result of lower interest rates paid on customer deposits and wholesale borrowings outpacing lower yields earned on loans and securities

table of contents other income excluding securities gains  other income totaled million in  a decrease of million  or  from  and an increase of million  or from explanations for the most significant changes in the components of other income are discussed immediately after the following table 
dollars in thousands trust fees service charges on deposits credit card fees atm and other service fees bank owned life insurance income investment services and life insurance fees gain from sale of partnership manufactured housing income investment securities gains  net loan sales and servicing other operating income trust fees decreased million  or  to million in the decline was mainly attributable to lower revenue earned on accounts whose fees were based on declining stock market valuations 
service charges on deposits rose million  or  compared to last year 
these fees are primarily based on the number of accounts  average account balances and customer checking and savings account activity 
credit card fees rose million or in the increase in card fees was due to higher debit card volume  increased merchant activity  increased home equity card usage and competitive cash advance and late fees 
atm and other service fees declined million  or  compared to lower fees earned on official bank checks as well as lower fees earned on atm activity were the main reasons for the decline 
investment services and life insurance fees increased million  or during as a result of higher commission income based on the success of the corporation s campaign to convert maturing cds into annuity products 
loan sales and servicing income was down million as a result of pretax impairment charges on mortgage servicing rights taken in the second and third quarters totaling million 
fees from increased mortgage loan originations  as well as gains on sales of conforming single family mortgage loans to the mortgage loan secondary markets  partially offset the losses incurred from the impairment of mortgage servicing rights 
other operating income totaled million for the increase from s total resulted from a gain from the sale of land  higher loan refinancing fees  and the fact that the period included a million restructure loss associated with the corporation s exit from the manufactured housing financing business

a break out of the restructure charges is shown in the restructure adjustments column in the following table 
note to the consolidated financial statements also provides additional information related to these mh costs 
expenses in the table that exclude mh exit costs are referred to as core expenses throughout this section 
core expenses put costs on a like basis with costs for the other periods shown 
core expenses are not considered to be in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap and  therefore  may not be comparable to similarly titled results presented by other companies

the increase in salaries and wages reflects annual employee merit increases while higher benefit costs are primarily due to increased pension expense and health care costs related to self insured medical plans 
equipment expense decreased million or in part due to lower equipment lease costs and reduced costs associated with computer and other equipment repair 
taxes  other than federal income taxes  declined million or due to lower state franchise taxes and state income taxes due to the corporation s exit from the manufactured housing financing business in the fourth quarter of bankcard  loan processing and other fees rose million  or  as a result of higher mortgage  bankcard and home equity activity caused by the low interest rate environment 
telephone expenses were down thousand or as streamlining the communication systems throughout the organization continues 
amortization of intangible assets was million in compared to million in the million decrease in amortization expense was a result of the corporation s january  implementation of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  and its elimination of goodwill amortization expense 
other operating expenses increased million  or from last year s level due in part to the establishment of higher reserves associated with automobile lease residual values

in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  securities have been classified as available for sale 
in this classification  adjustment to fair value of the securities available for sale in the form of unrealized holding gains and losses  is excluded from earnings and reported net of taxes in the other comprehensive income section of shareholders equity 
the pretax adjustment to increase fair value at year end was million and to increase fair value at year end was million 
at year ends and  investment securities totaled billion and billion  respectively 
the increase in the total portfolio occurred primarily in the us treasury government agency obligations and mortgage backed securities categories 
the increase reflects the reinvestment of funds generated from higher levels of core deposits gathered during the year 
additional discussion of the increase in investment securities is located in the liquidity risk management section of this report

the year over year decline in mortgage loans held in portfolio on the corporation s balance sheets totaled million  or  and occurred through scheduled repayment activity as well as loans refinanced at other financial institutions 
proceeds from the sales of mortgage loans sold in the secondary markets were used to fund growth in higher yielding home equity and credit card loans 
outstanding home equity loan balances increased million or from december  as a result of continued marketing campaigns  their potential tax advantages  and the historically low interest rate environment 
credit card outstandings grew million  or  to million at december  the increase is attributed to the opening of approximately  new accounts  an increase of approximately million spent by card users over the prior year and the introduction of a new wealth card in november installment loans increased million primarily due to an increase in used car loan originations 
manufactured housing balances fell million or during the year since originations of manufactured housing loans ceased october  the corporation s exit from the manufactured housing financing business is discussed further in note to the consolidated financial statements and in the other income and other expenses sections of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

successful management of credit risk requires making good underwriting decisions  carefully administering the loan portfolio and diligently collecting delinquent accounts 

table of contents the corporation s credit policy division manages credit risk by establishing common credit policies for its subsidiaries  participating in approval of their largest loans  conducting reviews of their loan portfolios  providing them with centralized consumer underwriting  collections and loan operations services  and overseeing their loan workouts 
notes  and to the consolidated financial statements provide detailed information regarding the corporation s credit policies and practices 
the corporation s objective is to minimize losses from its commercial lending activities and to maintain consumer losses at acceptable levels that are stable and consistent with growth and profitability objectives 
nonperforming assets are defined as follows nonaccrual loans on which interest is no longer accrued because its collection is doubtful

had they been paid in accordance with the payment terms in force prior to being considered impaired  on nonaccrual status  or restructured  they would have earned million 
in addition to nonperforming loans and loans days past due and still accruing interest  management identified potential problem loans classified as substandard and doubtful totaling million at year end these loans are closely monitored for any further deterioration in the borrowers financial condition and for the borrowers ability to comply with terms of the loans 

table of contents deposits and wholesale borrowings average deposits for totaled billion  compared to billion in  an increase of 
increases in non interest bearing and interest bearing demand accounts  as well as in savings and money market deposits  were a result of uncertainty in the stock market that kept investors liquid 
because of the influx in liquid deposits  the corporation was able to replace higher costing cds with lower yielding checking and savings instruments  and paydown wholesale borrowings 
the following ratios and table provide additional information about the change in the mix of customer deposits

time until maturity amount under months to months over months interest rate sensitivity interest rate sensitivity measures the potential exposure of earnings and capital to changes in market interest rates 
the corporation has a policy which provides guidelines in the management of interest rate risk 
this policy is reviewed periodically to ensure it complies to trends within the financial markets and within the industry 
the following analysis divides interest bearing assets and liabilities into maturity categories and measures the gap between maturing assets and liabilities in each category 
the corporation analyzes the historical sensitivity of its interest bearing transaction accounts to determine the portion which it classifies as interest rate sensitive versus the portion classified over one year 
the analysis shows that assets maturing within one year exceed liabilities maturing within the same period 
the corporation uses the gap analysis and other tools to monitor rate risk 

table of contents focusing on estimated repricing activity within days subsequent to year end  the corporation was in an asset sensitive position as illustrated in the following table over days days days days days year total interest earning assets loans and leases investment securities total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities demand interest bearing savings certificate and time deposits cds wholesale borrowings total interest bearing liabilities total gap cumulative gap market risk market risk refers to potential losses arising from changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates  equity prices and commodity prices  including the correlation among these factors and their volatility 
the corporation is primarily exposed to interest rate risk as a result of offering a wide array of financial products to its customers 
changes in market interest rates may result in changes in the fair market value of the corporation s financial instruments  cash flows  and net interest income 
the corporation seeks to achieve consistent growth in net interest income and capital while managing volatility arising from shifts in market interest rates 
the asset and liability committee alco oversees market risk management  establishing risk measures  limits and policy guidelines for managing the amount of interest rate risk and its effect on net interest income and capital 
according to these policies  responsibility for measuring and the management of interest rate risk reside in the corporate treasury function 
interest rate risk on the corporation s balance sheets consists of reprice  option  and basis risks 
reprice risk results from differences in the maturity  or repricing  of asset and liability portfolios 
option risk arises from embedded options present in many financial instruments such as loan prepayment options  deposit early withdrawal options and interest rate options 
these options allow customers opportunities to benefit when market interest rates change  which typically results in higher costs or lower revenue for the corporation 
basis risk refers to the potential for changes in the underlying relationship between market rates and indices  which subsequently result in a narrowing of profit spread on an earning asset or liability 
basis risk is also present in administered rate liabilities  such as now accounts  savings accounts and money market accounts where historical pricing relationships to market rates may change due to the level or directional change in market interest rates 
the interest rate risk position is measured and monitored using sophisticated and detailed risk management tools  including earnings simulation modelling and economic value of equity sensitivity analysis  which capture both near term and long term interest rate risk exposures 
combining the results from these separate risk measurement processes allows a reasonably comprehensive view of short term and long term interest rate risk in the corporation 
earnings simulation involves forecasting net interest earnings under a variety of scenarios including changes in the level of interest rates  the shape of the yield curve  and spreads between market interest rates 
the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates is measured using numerous interest rate scenarios including shocks  gradual ramps  curve flattening  curve steepening as well as forecasts of likely 
table of contents interest rates scenarios 
presented below is the corporation s interest rate risk profile as of year end and effect on net interest income of immediate change in rates bp bp bp december  december  modeling the sensitivity of net interest earnings to changes in market interest rates is highly dependent on numerous assumptions incorporated into the modeling process 
to the extent that actual performance is different than what was assumed  actual net interest earnings sensitivity may be different than projected 
the assumptions used in the models are management s best estimate based on studies conducted by alco 
alco uses a sophisticated data warehouse to study interest rate risk at a transactional level and uses various ad hoc reports to refine assumptions continuously 
assumptions and methodologies regarding administered rate liabilities  eg  savings  money market and interest bearing checking accounts  balance trends and repricing relationships reflect management s best estimate of expected behavior and these assumptions are reviewed regularly 
each year the forecasting accuracy of the model is tested in a back test study 
this study measures how closely the model would have predicted future net interest income by substituting actual interest rates and balance sheet volumes in a historical model  such as the risk model from one year ago 
all other assumptions remain as they were in the historical model 
net interest income is simulated and compared to actual results 
the results of the back test performed in  using the period of january through november  showed the model s assumptions were appropriate as simulated net interest income was within of realized net interest income 
alco and the board of directors review the results of the back test study 
the corporation also has longer term interest rate risk exposure  which may not be appropriately measured by earnings sensitivity analysis 
alco uses economic value of equity sensitivity analysis to study the impact of long term cash flows on earnings and capital 
economic value of equity involves discounting present values of all cash flows on the balance sheet under different interest rate scenarios 
the discounted present value of all cash flows represents the corporation s economic value of equity 
the analysis requires modifying the expected cash flows in each interest rate scenario  which will impact the discounted present value 
the amount of base case measurement and its sensitivity to shifts in the yield curve allows management to measure longer term repricing and option risk in the balance sheets

liquidity risk management liquidity risk is the possibility of the corporation being unable to meet current and future financial obligations in a timely manner 
liquidity is managed to ensure stable  reliable and cost effective sources of funds to satisfy demand for credit  deposit withdrawals and investment opportunities 
the corporation considers core earnings  strong capital ratios and credit quality essential for maintaining high credit ratings  which allow the corporation cost effective access to market based liquidity 
the corporation relies on a large  stable deposit base and a diversified base of wholesale funding sources to manage liquidity risk 
customer based deposits  the corporation s largest and most cost effective source of liquidity  accounted for of the average funding base in compared to in the treasury group is responsible for identifying  measuring and monitoring the corporation s liquidity profile 
the position is evaluated daily  weekly and monthly by analyzing the composition of all funding sources  reviewing projected liquidity commitments by future month and identifying sources and uses funds 
in addition  the overall management of the corporation s liquidity position is integrated into retail deposit pricing policies to ensure a stable deposit base 
the corporation s primary source of liquidity is its deposit base  raised through its retail branch system  along with unencumbered  or unpledged  investment securities and unused wholesale sources of liquidity 
additionally  liquidity is provided from sales of investment portfolio securities  the ability to acquire large and brokered deposits  and the ability to securitize or package loans for sale 
funding trends for the year 
during  increases in total deposits and slight decreases in loans were used to purchase short term investment portfolio securities and reduce wholesale borrowings 
on average the investment portfolio increased million while total deposits grew million and wholesale borrowings decreased million 
higher costing retail and jumbo certificates of deposit were allowed to mature as the corporation grew lower cost demand and non maturity deposits by million or 
parent company liquidity 
the corporation manages its liquidity principally through dividends from the bank subsidiary 
during  firstmerit bank paid firstmerit corporation a total of million in dividends 
as of year end  firstmerit bank had a minimal amount available to pay dividends without regulatory approval 
regulation and supervision financial institutions are subject to a strict uniform system of capital based regulation 
under this system  there are five different categories of capitalization  with prompt corrective actions and significant operational restrictions imposed on institutions that are capital deficient under the categories 
the five categories are well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized 
to be considered well capitalized an institution must have a total risk based capital ratio of at least  a tier i capital ratio of at least  a leverage capital ratio of  and must not be subject to any order or directive requiring the institution to improve its capital level 
an adequately capitalized institution has a total risk based 
table of contents capital ratio of at least  a tier i capital ratio of at least and a leverage capital ratio of at least 
institutions with lower capital levels are deemed to be undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized  depending on their actual capital levels 
the appropriate federal regulatory agency may also downgrade an institution to the next lower capital category upon a determination that the institution is in an unsafe or unsound practice 
institutions are required to monitor closely their capital levels and to notify their appropriate regulatory agency of any basis for a change in capital category 
at year end  firstmerit corporation  on a consolidated basis  as shown in the capital resources section of this report  as well as its subsidiary bank exceeded the minimum capital levels of the well capitalized category 
effects of inflation the assets and liabilities of the corporation are primarily monetary in nature and are more directly affected by the fluctuation in interest rates than inflation 
movement in interest rates is a result of the perceived changes in inflation as well as monetary and fiscal policies 
interest rates and inflation do not move with the same velocity or within the same time frame  therefore  a direct relationship to the inflation rate cannot be shown 
the financial information presented in this report  based on historical data  has a direct correlation to the influence of market levels of interest rates 
therefore  management believes that there is no material benefit in presenting a statement of financial data adjusted for inflationary changes 
critical accounting policies the corporation s most significant accounting policies are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
management has determined that accounting for the allowance for loan losses  income taxes and mortgage servicing rights are deemed critical because of the valuation techniques used  and the sensitivity of these financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions and estimates underlying these balances 
accounting for these critical areas requires the most subjective and complex judgments that could be subject to revision as new information becomes available 
as explained in note and note to the consolidated financial statements  the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
this estimate is based on the current economy s impact on the timing and expected amounts of future cash flows on impaired loans  as well as historical loss experience associated with homogenous pools of loans 
changes in economic conditions can result in significant changes to management s estimate of the allowance for loan losses 
the income tax amounts in note reflect the current period income tax expense for all periods shown  as well as future tax liabilities associated with differences in the timing of expenses and income recognition for book and tax accounting purposes 
the current income tax liability also includes management s estimate of potential adjustments by taxing authorities 
the income tax returns  which are usually filed nine months after year end  are subject to review and possible revision by the taxing authorities  until the statue of limitations has expired 
these statutes usually expire within three years of from the time the respective tax returns are filed 
accounting for mortgage servicing rights is more fully discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements and is another area heavily dependent on current economic conditions  especially the interest rate environment  and management s estimates 
the corporation uses discounted cash flow modeling techniques in determining this asset s value 
the modeled results utilize estimates about the amount and timing of mortgage loan repayments  estimated prepayment rates  credit loss experiences  costs to service the loans and discount rates to consider the risks involved in the estimation process 
management believes its modeling technique and assumptions are consistent with those currently utilized by other financial institutions
