forward looking statements this report and other documents we file with the sec contain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results  performance  achievements or industry results to be materially different from any future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
such factors include  among other things  the following possible changes in the levels and terms of reimbursement for our charges by government programs  including medicare or medicaid or other third party payors  existing laws and government regulations and changes in or failure to comply with laws and governmental regulations  our ability to successfully integrate recent and future acquisitions  competition  demographic changes  technological and pharmaceutical improvements that increase the cost of providing  or reduce the demand for  our services  our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel  including physicians  and our ability to finance growth on favorable terms 
undue reliance should not be placed on our forward looking statements 
except as required by law  we disclaim any obligation to update any such factors or to publicly announce the results of any revisions to any of the forward looking statements contained in this report in order to reflect future events or developments 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we consider our critical accounting policies to be those that require us to make more significant judgments and estimates when we prepare our financial statements  including the following net patient service revenues we derive a significant portion of our revenues from the medicare and medicaid programs and from managed care health plans 
payments for services we render to patients covered by these programs are generally less than billed charges 
for medicare and medicaid revenues  provisions for contractual adjustments are made to reduce the charges to these patients to estimated receipts based upon the programs principles of payment or reimbursement either prospectively determined or retrospectively determined costs 
final payment under these programs is subject to administrative review and audit  and we currently make provisions for any adjustments which may result 
our provisions for contractual allowances under managed care health plans are based primarily on payment terms of contractual arrangements such as predetermined rates per diagnosis  per diem rates or a discounted percent from charges 
we closely monitor our historical collection rates as well as changes in applicable laws  rules and regulations and contract terms to help assure that provisions are made using the most accurate information we believe to be available 
however  due to the complexities involved in these estimations  actual payments we receive could be different from the amounts we estimate and record 
provision for doubtful accounts collection of receivables from third party payors and patients is our primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance 
our primary collection risks relate to uninsured patient accounts and patient accounts for which the primary insurance payor has paid  but patient responsibility amounts generally deductibles and co payments remain outstanding 
we estimate provisions for doubtful accounts based primarily upon the age of patient s account  the economic ability of patients to pay and the effectiveness of our collection efforts 
we routinely review accounts receivable balances in conjunction with our historical collection rates and other economic conditions which might ultimately affect the collectibility of patient accounts when we consider the adequacy of the amounts we record as reserves for doubtful accounts 
significant changes in payer mix  business office operations  economic conditions or trends in federal and state governmental health care coverage could affect our collection of accounts receivable  cash flows and results of operations 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review our long lived assets  including amortizable intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be fully recoverable 
the assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of our asset based on our estimate of its undiscounted future cash flows 
if these estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset  an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the asset s estimated fair value and its carrying value 
as of the date of these financial statements  we were not aware of any items or events that would cause us to adjust the recorded value of our long lived assets  including amortizable intangible assets  for impairment 
goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is not amortized 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment at the reporting unit level  as defined by sfas no 
 on an annual basis or sooner if indicators of impairment arise 
we periodically evaluate each reporting unit for potential impairment indicators 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance of each reporting unit 
during the fourth quarter of  we completed our annual impairment review of our goodwill 
the impairment review indicated that our goodwill was not impaired 
future changes in the estimates used to conduct the impairment review  including revenue and profitability projections or market values could cause our analysis to indicate that our goodwill is impaired in subsequent periods and result in a write off of a portion or all of our goodwill 
income taxes we must make estimates in recording provision for income taxes  including determination of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required against the deferred tax assets 
we believe that future income will enable us to realize these benefits  and  therefore  we have not recorded any valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset 
we operate in multiple states with varying tax laws 
we are subject to both federal and state audits of tax returns 
our federal income tax returns have been examined by the internal revenue service through fiscal year  which resulted in no material adjustments 
our fiscal year and federal income tax returns are currently being audited by the internal revenue service 
we make estimates we believe are accurate in order to determine that tax reserves are adequate to cover any potential audit adjustments 
professional liability insurance claims in response to the difficulty we encountered in obtaining primary insurance from commercial companies at reasonable rates  on october  we formed a wholly owned insurance subsidiary in order to self insure a greater portion of our primary professional and general liability risk 
our captive subsidiary reinsures risk up to million per claim and million in the aggregate per hospital  and further acts as an excess insurer for all of our hospitals in combination with three commercial insurance companies 
the total cost of our profesional liability program was approximaley of net revenue in fiscal and in fiscal we determine our accruals for self insured professional liability risks using asserted and unasserted claims identified by our incident reporting system as well as by using actuarially determined estimates based on our internal as well as industry wide historical loss payment patterns 
we have discounted our accruals for self insured professional liability risks to their present value using a discount rate of 
although the ultimate settlement of these accruals may vary from our estimates  we believe that the amounts provided in our consolidated financial statements are adequate 
however  if the actual payments of claims exceed our projected estimates of claims  our insurance accruals could be materially adversely affected 
results of operations fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  our net patient service revenue for the fiscal year ended september   or fiscal  was  million 
this compares to  million in net revenue for our fiscal year ended september   or fiscal this represented an increase in our net patient service revenue of million  or 
hospitals in operation for the entire period of fiscal and fiscal  which we refer to as same hospitals  provided million of the increase in net patient service revenue  which resulted both from an increase in inpatient and outpatient volumes and from rate increases 
net revenue per adjusted admission at our same hospitals increased for fiscal a contributing factor to the rate increases and the net per adjusted admission increase was the renegotiation of managed care contracts during fiscal  or of the total number of contracts 
the average increase was approximately 
commercial and managed care revenue represented approximately of our total net revenue during fiscal the source of the remaining net increase of million in net patient service revenue included million in net patient service revenue from our acquisitions of an bed hospital in december  an bed hospital  a bed hospital  and a bed hospital in january  a bed hospital in may  a bed hospital in january  a bed hospital and a bed hospital in august  and a bed hospital in september  and a million increase in net patient service revenue from our psychiatric hospitals and other corporate revenue

in addition  during fiscal  our rent expense increased by million primarily as a result of the acquisitions we completed during the year and the expansion of services provided in our hospitals 
during fiscal  our depreciation and amortization costs increased by million 
this increase in depreciation and amortization resulted primarily from the acquisitions we completed during fiscal as a result of the repayment of our convertible senior subordinated debentures due on august  and lower interest rates on our remaining debt  our interest expense decreased million 
our writeoff of million of unamortized deferred financing costs is a result of the repayment of our convertible senior subordinated debentures due on august  our income before income taxes was million for fiscal and million for fiscal  an increase of million or

our fiscal rent expense increased by million  primarily as a result of the acquisitions we completed during the year as well as our expansion of services provided in our hospitals 
between fiscal and our depreciation and amortization costs increased by million 
the increase primarily resulted from the acquisitions described above  offset by a decrease in amortization expense related to our adoption of sfas no 
on october  our interest expense decreased million due to paydowns on higher interest rate debt and lower interest rates on our remaining overall outstanding debt 
our non cash charge of million consists of million for the present value of the future costs of retirement benefits granted to our chairman pursuant to an agreement which became effective january  and million for the write down of two hospital assets held for sale in conjunction with their respective replacement 
the two hospital assets that were written down were facilities for which replacement facilities were completed in june and march the charge for the write down of these facilities was recorded in our quarter ended march  during the period between completion of the new facilities and the recording of the charge  we were evaluating our options for the sale of the facilities that had been replaced 
during the period ended march   we finalized our plans for the old facilities and obtained the information necessary to estimate the loss on sale 
our income before income taxes was million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal this represents an increase of million or 
excluding the non recurring charge for retirement benefits and write down of assets held for sale of million in fiscal  our income before taxes was million in fiscal as compared to million for fiscal  an increase of million or

liquidity  capital resources  and capital expenditures liquidity fiscal cash flows compared to fiscal cash flows our working capital increased to million at september  from million at september  this increase resulted from our receipt of proceeds from the sale of our convertible senior subordinated notes due  or notes  as well as from increased business volumes and our continued efficient management of working capital 
our cash flows from operating activities decreased by million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal our improved profitability was offset by a decrease in working capital which resulted in an overall decrease in cash flows from operations in fiscal compared to fiscal our use of cash in investing activities decreased by million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this decrease resulted primarily from our acquisition of four hospitals in fiscal compared to our acquisition of five hospitals in fiscal our cash flows provided by financing activities increased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase is primarily the result of borrowings of million in connection with the issuance of the notes  offset by million used for the repayment of our convertible senior subordinated debentures due fiscal cash flows compared to fiscal cash flows our working capital increased to million at september  from million at september  this increase resulted primarily from increased business volumes as well as from continued efficient management of our working capital 
our cash flows from operating activities increased by million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal our improved profitability contributed to the majority of this net increase 
our use of cash in investing activities increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase resulted from our acquisition of five hospitals in fiscal compared to two hospitals in our cash flows from financing activities increased million from million used in fiscal to million provided in fiscal the increase is primarily the result of net proceeds on borrowing of million which was offset by million used for stock repurchases in fiscal effect of legislative and regulatory action on liquidity the medicare and medicaid reimbursement programs are subject to ongoing changes as a result of legislative and regulatory actions 
we believe that these changes will continue to limit payment increases under these programs 
however  we do not believe that these changes will have a material adverse effect on our future revenue or our liquidity 
nevertheless  within the statutory framework of the medicare and medicaid programs  there are substantial areas subject to administrative rulings  interpretations and discretion which may further affect payments made under those programs 
in the future  both the federal and state governments might reduce the funds available under those programs or require more stringent utilization and quality reviews of hospital facilities  either of which could have a material adverse effect on our future revenue and our liquidity 
additionally  any future restructuring of the financing and delivery of health care in the united states and the continued rise in managed care programs could have an effect on our future revenue and liquidity 
capital resources credit facilities we currently have a year million credit agreement due november  this credit agreement is a term loan agreement which permits us to borrow under an unsecured revolving credit line at any time through november   at which time the agreement will terminate and all outstanding amounts owed by us will become due and payable 
if we choose to borrow under the credit agreement  we may choose a loan based on an interest rate equal to the prime interest rate or an interest rate based on the libor interest rate 
under the credit agreement  the interest rate for a loan based on the libor interest rate is currently the libor rate plus percent 
this interest rate under the credit agreement is subject to change should our credit rating change 
assuming we were to choose an interest rate based on the libor interest rate  the applicable interest rate under the credit agreement would have been and at september  and  respectively 
as of september  and  we did not have any outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement 
in october  we borrowed million under the credit agreement to partially finance the acquisition of five hospitals on november  see business recent transactions in item we also have a million unsecured revolving working capital credit commitment with a commercial bank 
this credit commitment is tied to our cash management system and renews annually each november we must pay interest on any outstanding balance monthly at a fluctuating rate not to exceed the bank s prime rate less 
the interest rate at september  and was and  respectively 
as of september  and  we did not have any amounts outstanding under the credit commitment 
during the term of the credit agreement  we are obligated to pay certain commitment fees based upon amounts available to us for borrowing 
in addition  each of the above credit facilities contains covenants which  without prior consent of the lenders under such facilities  limit certain of our activities  including those relating to mergers  consolidations and our ability to borrow additional money  make guarantees  grant security interests and declare dividends 
furthermore  each of the credit facilities requires us to maintain minimum levels of consolidated tangible net worth  debt service coverage and interest coverage 
at september  and  we were in compliance with all of these covenants

capital expenditures our business strategy calls for us to continue to acquire hospitals that meet our acquisition criteria 
the acquisition of hospitals accounted for a significant portion of our capital expenditures in each of fiscal and fiscal we generally fund acquisitions  replacement hospitals and other ongoing capital expenditure requirements from cash on hand generated from our operating cash flows and from availability under our credit agreement 
during fiscal  excess proceeds from the notes sold in july and august also provided a source of funding for our five hospital acquisition completed on november  transactions completed or pending for fiscal on november   we announced the acquisition of five non urban hospitals from subsidiaries of tenet healthcare corporation 
the five hospitals acquired included seven rivers community hospital  a bed hospital located in crystal river  florida  harton regional medical center  a bed hospital located in tullahoma  tennessee  university medical center  a two campus bed hospital located in lebanon  tennessee  three rivers health care  a two campus bed hospital located in poplar bluff  missouri  and twin rivers regional medical center  a bed hospital located in kennett  missouri 
the purchase price was approximately million in cash 
in october  we received approval from the state of florida agency for health care administration to construct our proposed bed collier regional medical center in southeast collier county  florida 
pending any appeal that might be made  we anticipate beginning construction in the next months 
the cost of the project is expected to be approximately million 
we currently have several hospital renovation and expansion projects underway 
we do not believe that any of these projects are individually significant or that they represent in the aggregate a significant commitment of our resources 
in addition to our ongoing renovation and expansion projects  over the course of the next three years we plan to replace three of our existing hospitals brooksville  florida  carlisle  pennsylvania  and lancaster  pennsylvania and complete our proposed collier regional medical center in southeast collier county  florida 
regulatory approval to begin construction has been granted 
as of september   we had invested approximately million in these projects 
we anticipate spending between approximately and million for capital equipment  renovations  and replacement hospitals during fiscal transactions completed in fiscal on september   we acquired walton medical center  a bed hospital located in monroe  georgia  for approximately million in cash and million in assumed liabilities 
on august   we acquired the assets of providence yakima medical center located in yakima  washington and providence toppenish hospital located in toppenish  washington  a bed acute care hospital system  for approximately million in cash and million in assumed liabilities 
this transaction represented our first geographic expansion into the northwestern united states 
on january   we acquired  pursuant to a year lease  the madison county medical center  a bed acute care hospital located in canton  mississippi  for approximately million in cash 
transactions completed in fiscal on august   we purchased an office complex in naples  florida consisting of two commercial office buildings  including the building that houses our corporate headquarters

effective may   we acquired all of the assets of mesquite community hospital from manor care  inc for million in cash and subsequently sold back to manor care  inc a equity interest in such hospital for million in cash 
as part of this transaction  we also sold to manor care  inc a equity interest in the medical center of mesquite which was acquired by us on december  for million in cash 
in february  we initiated a stock repurchase program to repurchase up to  shares of our common stock 
on august   we announced the completion of this stock repurchase program 
under this program we used cash on hand to repurchase a total of  shares of our common stock at an average purchase price of per share 
effective january   we acquired the stock of four acute care hospitals from clarent hospital corporation for approximately million in cash 
later the same day we sold one of these hospitals to a third party for million in cash 
effective december  we acquired the assets of east pointe hospital  including substantially all of the hospital s property  plant and equipment  for approximately million in cash 
in september  we initiated a stock repurchase program to repurchase up to  shares of our common stock 
on january   we announced the completion of this stock repurchase program 
under this program we used cash on hand to repurchase a total of  shares of our common stock at an average price of per share 
off balance sheet arrangements at september   we were party to certain off balance sheet arrangements 
these consisted of obligations under standby letters of credit  lease transactions and contractual obligations to provide financial assistance to physicians relocating to our communities 
standby letters of credit standby letters of credit outstanding  as of september   were approximately million 
these outstanding letters of credit consisted of the following million related to the self insured portions of our insurance programs as security for the payment of claims  million in performance guarantees for the construction of our carlisle  pennsylvania  and lancaster  pennsylvania  replacement hospitals  
million for obligations related to certain utility companies 
lease transactions obligations under operating leases for real property  real property master leases and equipment totaled approximately million 
the real property master leases are leases for buildings on or near hospital property for which we guarantee a certain level of rental income 
we sublease space in these buildings and any amounts received under these subleases are offset against the expense 
the minimum payments under all operating lease arrangements are detailed in note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item physician guarantees in consideration for a physician relocating to one of our communities and agreeing to engage in private practice  we may advance money to the physician to assist in the establishment of the physician s practice 
we have committed to advance approximately million at september  under these arrangements 
the actual amount of these commitments is dependent upon the financial results of each physician s private practice during the guarantee period  which generally does not exceed twelve months 
the net amounts advanced under these recruiting agreements at the end of the individual s guarantee period are considered loans and are generally forgiven pro rata over a period of months contingent upon the physician continuing to practice in the respective community 
our practice is to expense these advances on a straight line basis as they are paid over the guarantee period 
days sales outstanding at the beginning of each fiscal year  we announce a number of financial and quality objectives for the coming fiscal year  including days sales outstanding dso 
our dso is calculated by dividing the quarterly net revenue by the number of days in the quarter 
the result is divided into the accounts receivable balance at the end of the quarter to obtain the dso 
this statistic is an important measure of collection of our accounts receivable 
below is a table of actual days compared to our objectives 
september actual days sales outstanding objective for days sales outstanding the variance from the prior year and our objective resulted from the acquisitions we completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal we are currently in the process of obtaining medicare and medicaid provider numbers for these newly acquired hospitals 
until provider numbers are obtained  these hospitals will continue to treat patients under the medicare and medicaid programs  but will be unable to bill medicare and medicaid 
once we obtain these provider numbers  we will be able to bill for all medicare and medicaid patients previously treated 
this contributed days of the day increase 
net of such acquisitions  our dso would have been days 
our pulse system tm provides a weekly aging of our outstanding accounts receivable 
the primary uses of this aging are to manage and evaluate the collectibility of our receivables and calculate the adequacy of allowances 
our hospitals provide services to patients with health care coverage as well as those without health care coverage 
those patients with health care coverage are often responsible for a portion of the bill referred to as the co payment or deductible 
this portion is determined by the specific plan in which the patient participates 
patients without health care coverage are evaluated at the time of service or shortly thereafter  for their ability to pay based on federal and state poverty guidelines  qualification for medicaid or other state assistance programs  as well as the local hospital s policies for indigent care 
after payment is received from a third party  if any  statements are sent indicating the outstanding balance on the account 
if the account is still outstanding after a period of time  the account is referred to a primary collection agency for assistance in collecting the amount due 
the primary collection agency begins the process of debt collection to include contact with the patient via mail and phone 
the purpose of this process is to work with the patient to resolve the outstanding debt 
all non governmental accounts over days old from date of discharge are reserved for in our allowance for bad debts 
the following table is an aging of our gross prior to allowances for contractual adjustments and doubtful accounts discharged accounts receivable september  in thousands days days and over days days and over due from third party payors     private pay     total gross discharged accounts receivable     impact of seasonality and inflation seasonality we typically experience higher patient volumes and net patient service revenue in the second and third quarters of each fiscal year 
we typically experience such seasonal volume and revenue peaks because more people generally become ill during the winter months  which in turn results in significant increases in the number of patients we treat during those months 
inflation the health care industry is labor intensive and is subject to wage and other expense increases  especially during periods of inflation and when shortages of skilled labor occur 
there is currently a shortage of skilled nursing staff industry wide  which has caused nursing salaries to increase 
we have addressed the nursing staffing needs in our markets through increasing wages  improving hospital working conditions  fostering relationships with local nursing schools  and implementing our nurseselect tm internal nursing agency program in four of our markets 
we do not believe that the inflationary trend in nursing salaries or the nursing shortage will have an adverse effect on our net income 
in addition  suppliers pass along rising costs to us in the form of higher prices 
thus far  we believe that we have been able to offset increases in our operating costs through a combination of increasing prices  achieving quantity discounts for purchases under our group purchasing agreement  and by more efficient utilization of resources 
although we have implemented cost control measures to curb increases in operating costs and expenses  we cannot predict our ability to cover or offset future cost increases 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates we are exposed to interest rate fluctuations  primarily as a result of our million credit agreement that has an interest rate subject to market fluctuations 
however  we do not currently use derivative instruments to alter the interest rate characteristics of any of our debt 
the following table summarizes principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates
