item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction except for the historical information contained herein  the discussion in this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements that involve risk  assumptions  and uncertainties that are difficult to predict 
words such as believe  may  could  expects  likely  variations of these words  and similar expressions  are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed below in the section entitled factors that may affect future results  as well as those discussed in this item and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
general beginning in and continuing through the present  truckload carriers have operated in a very difficult business environment 
a combination of high fuel prices  rising insurance premiums  a depressed used truck market  a declining number of independent contractors  and slowing freight demand associated with an economic downturn affected the profitability of many trucking companies  including smithway 
in addition to these general industry factors  the impact of the economic downturn on smithway s customer base has been particularly severe  resulting in a more pronounced weakening in the company s freight demand than that experienced by truckload carriers generally 
since the fourth quarter of  approximately thirty of the company s significant customers have declared bankruptcy  and several others have experienced economic difficulties 
over the past three years the size of the company s business has decreased  and the company has experienced a net loss in each year 
from to  operating revenue decreased  to million in from million in for the year  smithway experienced a net loss of million or per basic and diluted share 
the operating losses have had an adverse effect on the company s liquidity and the company was in default at december   under its primary financing arrangement 
although a waiver was received and financial covenants were subsequently amended to reflect financial performance that management believes is reasonably achievable  there can be no assurance the company will maintain compliance with all covenants in its borrowing obligations  or if unable to maintain compliance that it will be able to obtain a waiver or amendment thereof  or that it will have sufficient cash flow to meet its liquidity requirements 
see liquidity and capital resources uses and sources of cash and factors that may affect future results operating losses and liquidity concerns for a more detailed discussion 
the loss in included a fourth quarter million pre tax write off of goodwill associated with one of the company s reporting units  and a million pre tax increase in auto liability and workers compensation loss reserves 
the increase in liability reserves relates primarily to a change in estimating the ultimate costs of claims that occurred in prior years 
despite the increase in auto liability reserves  in the company had its best safety year  in terms of accidents per million miles  since going public in smithway s revenue was primarily impacted by reduced revenue per tractor per week and brokerage revenue versus the prior year  caused by a slowing economy and lower productivity from the company s flatbed fleet 
in addition  higher fuel prices and insurance premiums and tighter credit standards by lending institutions caused the number of independent contractors providing tractors to smithway to drop by approximately during with fewer independent contractors and lower production  smithway s revenue base suffered 
on the expense side  smithway s profitability was affected primarily by higher insurance premiums  higher than historical fuel prices  increased parts and maintenance expense associated with an aging fleet  and the previously mentioned adjustments relating to reserves and goodwill 
the company operates a tractor trailer fleet comprised of both company owned vehicles and vehicles obtained under leases from independent contractors and third party finance companies 
fluctuations among expense categories may occur as a result of changes in the relative percentage of the fleet obtained through equipment that is owned versus equipment that is leased from independent contractors or financing sources 
costs associated with revenue equipment acquired under operating leases or through agreements with independent contractors are expensed as purchased transportation 
for these categories of equipment the company does not incur costs such as interest and depreciation as it might with owned equipment 
in addition  independent contractor tractors  driver compensation  fuel  communications  and certain other expenses are borne by the independent contractors and are not incurred by the company 
obtaining equipment from independent contractors and under operating leases reduces capital expenditures and on balance sheet leverage and effectively shifts expenses from interest to above the line operating expenses 
the fleet profile and the company s relative recruiting and retention success with company employed drivers and independent contractors will cause fluctuations from time to time in the percentage of the company s fleet that is owned versus obtained from independent contractors and under operating leases 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage relationship of certain items to revenue for the periods indicated operating revenue operating expenses purchased transportation compensation and employee benefits fuel  supplies  and maintenance insurance and claims taxes and licenses general and administrative communication and utilities depreciation and amortization total operating expenses earnings loss from operations interest expense  net loss before income taxes income taxes benefit net loss comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  operating revenue decreased million  to million in from million in lower weighted average tractors  decreased fuel surcharge revenue  decreased brokerage revenue  and lower average revenue per tractor per week were responsible for the decrease in operating revenue 
weighted average tractors decreased to  in from  in as the company disposed of a portion of its unseated company owned tractors in the last half of and contracted with fewer independent contractor providers of equipment 
management expects weighted average tractors will remain at current levels as few tractors are scheduled to be added in fuel surcharge revenue decreased million to million in from million in during and  approximately million and million  respectively  of the fuel surcharge revenue collected helped to offset company fuel costs 
the remainder was passed through to independent contractors 
additionally  soft freight demand caused a million decrease in brokerage revenue  to million in from million in finally  average revenue per tractor per week excluding revenue from brokerage operations and fuel surcharges decreased to  in from  in  primarily due to a higher number of unseated company tractors during the first half of and lower weekly production caused by soft freight demand 
these factors were partially offset by an increase in revenue per loaded mile  net of surcharges  to in from in purchased transportation consists primarily of payments to independent contractor providers of revenue equipment  expenses related to brokerage activities  and payments under operating leases of revenue equipment 
purchased transportation decreased million  to million in from million in  as the company contracted with fewer independent contractor providers of revenue equipment 
management believes the decline in independent contractors as a percentage of the company s fleet is attributable to high fuel costs  high insurance costs  tighter credit standards  and slow freight demand  which have diminished the pool of drivers interested in becoming or remaining independent contractors 
as a percentage of revenue  purchased transportation remained constant at in both years  as the drop in total operating revenue more than exceeded the drop in owner operator revenue 
compensation and employee benefits decreased million  to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  compensation and employee benefits increased to in from in the increase was primarily attributable to a increase in reserves for workers compensation losses  including losses which have been incurred but not yet reported to the company 
additionally  wages paid to drivers for unloaded miles increased during the year as weak freight demand caused an increase in deadhead miles 
finally  health claims and premiums increased in compared with  and management expects this trend to continue in future periods 
fuel  supplies  and maintenance decreased million  to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  fuel  supplies  and maintenance decreased to of revenue in compared with in this decrease was attributable primarily to lower fuel prices  which decreased approximately to an average of per gallon in from per gallon in the price decrease was partially offset by higher non billable miles for which the company incurs fuel expense but does not receive fuel surcharges 
although average fuel prices were lower than levels  fuel prices have risen over the last three quarters of  and have continued to rise in accordingly  fuel expense as a percentage of revenue is expected to increase in the first quarter of and perhaps beyond depending on fuel prices 
cost savings resulting from lower fuel prices were partially offset by higher maintenance expense resulting from i an increase in the percentage of the company s fleet supplied by company owned equipment  and ii a slightly older fleet  as a result of the company s decision to further extend its trade cycle for tractors 
although the average age of the company s tractor fleet decreased during due to the sale of older equipment that was not replaced  the company incurred increased maintenance expense on the aging units that remained in service 
the extension of the trade cycle is expected to continue to impact maintenance expense in future periods 
insurance and claims increased million  to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  insurance and claims increased to of revenue in compared with in the increase was attributable to a million increase in reserves for auto liability losses 
the increase in liability reserves relates primarily to a change in estimating the ultimate costs of claims that occurred in prior years 
despite the increase in reserves  in the company had its best safety year  in terms of accidents per million miles  since going public in the cost of insurance and claims increased substantially on july   when the company increased its self insured retention from  to  per occurrence without a premium reduction that fully offset the increase in retention 
the higher self insured retention increases the company s risk associated with frequency and severity of accidents and could increase the company s expenses or make them more volatile from period to period 
the insurance policies are scheduled for renewal on july  if the company is unable to renew the policies on their current terms  we may modify the company s self insured retention  and or excess coverage  or evaluate other alternatives 
taxes and licenses decreased   to million in from million in  reflecting a decrease in the number of company owned tractors subject to annual license and permit costs 
as a percentage of revenue  taxes and licenses remained constant at of revenue in and general and administrative expenses decreased million  to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expenses remained relatively constant at of revenue in compared with of revenue in communications and utilities decreased  to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  communications and utilities remained constant at of revenue in both years 
depreciation and amortization increased   to million in from million in during the annual goodwill impairment analysis required by statement of financial accounting standard sfas  the company determined that a portion of its goodwill had become impaired during the year primarily as a result of continuing operating losses 
as a result  the company wrote off million of goodwill in the fourth quarter of in  the company committed to a plan to replace its proprietary computer operating system with third party software 
accordingly  the company wrote off the  carrying value of its existing software during the fourth quarter of in accordance with industry practices  the gain or loss on retirement  sale  or write down of equipment is included in depreciation and amortization 
in and  depreciation and amortization included net gains from the sale of equipment of  and  respectively 
in addition  included million for goodwill impairment and included  for the write off of a proprietary operating system 
increasing costs of new equipment continued to increase depreciation per tractor 
as a percentage of revenue  depreciation and amortization increased to of revenue in compared with in  primarily as a result of these factors 
excluding the write offs  depreciation and amortization remained constant at of revenue in and interest expense  net  decreased million  to million in from million in this decrease was attributable to lower interest rates and lower average debt outstanding 
as a percentage of revenue  interest expense  net  decreased to of revenue in compared with in as a result of the foregoing  the company s pre tax margin decreased to in from in the company s income tax benefit was million  or of loss before income taxes 
the company s income tax benefit in was million  or of loss before income taxes 
in both years  the effective tax rate is different from the expected combined tax rate for a company headquartered in iowa because of the cost of nondeductible driver per diem expense absorbed by the company 
the impact of the company s paying per diem travel expenses varies depending upon the ratio of drivers to independent contractors and the level of the company s pre tax earnings 
as a result of the factors described above  net loss was million in of revenue  compared with net loss of million in of revenue 
comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  operating revenue decreased million  to million in from million in lower average revenue per tractor per week  decreased brokerage revenue  and decreased fuel surcharge revenue were responsible for the decrease in operating revenue 
average revenue per tractor per week excluding revenue from brokerage operations and fuel surcharges decreased to  in from  in  primarily due to a higher number of unseated company tractors  lower weekly production caused by soft freight demand  and lower weekly production of tractors acquired from skipper transportation  inc in addition  soft freight demand caused a million decrease in brokerage revenue  to million in from million in finally  fuel surcharge revenue decreased million to million in from million in during and  approximately million and million  respectively  of the fuel surcharge revenue collected helped to offset company fuel costs 
the remainder was passed through to independent contractors 
these factors were partially offset by an increase in revenue per loaded mile  net of surcharges  to in from in purchased transportation consists primarily of payments to independent contractor providers of revenue equipment  expenses related to brokerage activities  and payments under operating leases of revenue equipment 
purchased transportation decreased million  to million in from million in  as the company contracted with fewer independent contractor providers of revenue equipment 
as a percentage of revenue  purchased transportation decreased to in from in this reflects a decrease in the percentage of the company s fleet supplied by independent contractors 
management believes the decline in independent contractor percentage is attributable to high fuel costs  high insurance costs  tighter credit standards  and slow freight demand  which have diminished the pool of drivers interested in becoming or remaining independent contractors 
compensation and employee benefits increased million  to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  compensation and employee benefits increased to in from in the increases were primarily attributable to the increase in the percentage of the company s fleet represented by company owned equipment 
additionally  wages paid to drivers for unloaded miles increased during the year as weak freight demand caused an increase in deadhead miles 
finally  workers compensation claims and premiums increased in compared with fuel  supplies  and maintenance increased million  to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  fuel  supplies  and maintenance increased to of revenue in compared with in this was attributable primarily to i an increase in the percentage of the company s fleet supplied by company owned equipment  ii a slightly older fleet of company owned equipment as the company has extended its trade cycle for tractors  and iii higher non billable miles for which the company incurs fuel expense  but does not recoup increased costs through fuel surcharges 
these factors were partially offset by a decrease in fuel prices  which decreased to an average of per gallon in from per gallon in fuel surcharge revenue attributable to loads hauled by company trucks remained relatively constant at million in compared with million in insurance and claims increased million  to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  insurance and claims increased to of revenue in compared with in the increase was attributable to a substantial increase in insurance premiums on july   when the company s insurance policies were renewed 
additionally  liability claims paid and reserved increased 
taxes and licenses decreased   to million in from million in  reflecting a decrease in the number of shipments requiring special permits 
the special permits are paid for by the shippers  which is included in freight revenue 
as a percentage of revenue  taxes and licenses remained constant at of revenue in and general and administrative expenses remained essentially constant at million in and during the fourth quarter of  steel company bankruptcies caused the company to increase its allowance for doubtful accounts by  similarly  during the fourth quarter of  three major customers declared bankruptcy causing the company to increase its allowance for doubtful accounts by  general and administrative expenses  excluding bankruptcies  increased  in as the company incurred higher costs associated with recruiting and training new drivers 
as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expenses remained relatively constant at of revenue in compared with of revenue in however  without the increases in allowance for doubtful accounts during and  general and administrative expenses would have increased to of revenue in compared with in communications and utilities remained essentially constant at million in and as a percentage of revenue  communications and utilities remained relatively constant at of revenue in compared with of revenue in depreciation and amortization decreased   to million in from million in in  the company committed to a plan to replace its proprietary computer operating system with third party software 
accordingly  the company wrote off the  carrying value of its existing software during the fourth quarter 
in and  the market value of used tractors declined in the united states 
in response  management assessed the valuation of its long lived assets and identified tractors with carrying values in excess of recoverable value 
the carrying value of these tractors was reduced by million in in accordance with industry practices  the gain or loss on retirement  sale  or write down of equipment is included in depreciation and amortization 
in and  the company recognized net gains on equipment  excluding one time write downs  of  and  respectively 
additionally  increasing costs of new equipment continued to increase depreciation per tractor 
as a percentage of revenue  depreciation and amortization remained essentially constant at of revenue in and in interest expense  net  decreased million  to million in from million in this decrease was attributable to lower interest rates and lower average debt outstanding 
as a percentage of revenue  interest expense  net  decreased to of revenue in compared with in as a result of the foregoing  the company s pre tax margin decreased to in from in the company s income tax benefit was million  or of loss before income taxes 
the company s income tax benefit in was  or of loss before income taxes 
in both years  the effective tax rate is different from the expected combined tax rate for a company headquartered in iowa because of the cost of nondeductible driver per diem expense absorbed by the company 
the impact of the company s paying per diem travel expenses varies depending upon the ratio of drivers to independent contractors and the level of the company s pre tax earnings 
as a result of the factors described above  net loss was million in of revenue  compared with net loss of million in of revenue 
liquidity and capital resources uses and sources of cash the company requires cash to fund working capital requirements and to service its debt 
the company has historically financed acquisitions of new equipment with borrowings under installment notes payable to commercial lending institutions and equipment manufacturers  borrowings under lines of credit  cash flow from operations  and equipment leases from third party lessors 
the company also has obtained a portion of its revenue equipment fleet from independent contractors who own and operate the equipment  which reduces overall capital expenditure requirements compared with providing a fleet of entirely company owned equipment 
the company s primary sources of liquidity have been funds provided by operations and borrowings under credit arrangements with financial institutions and equipment manufacturers 
the company is experiencing a period of negative cash flow as continuing losses and declining revenue have resulted in lower cash generated from operations and reduced borrowing capacity 
as of the date of this report  the company has little borrowing availability on its line of credit 
accordingly  the company expects minimal capital expenditures during the company s ability to fund its cash requirements in future periods will depend on its ability to comply with covenants contained in financing arrangements and improve its operating results and cash flow 
the company s ability to achieve the required improvements will depend on general shipping demand by the company s customers  fuel prices  the availability of drivers and independent contractors  insurance and claims experience  and other factors 
management is in the process of implementing several steps that are intended to improve the company s operating results and achieve compliance with the financial covenants 
these steps include expanding the size of the company s tractor fleet through the addition of two identified dedicated fleet operations and recruiting approximately owner operators over the remainder of the year  improving the utilization per tractor through a full time production manager and expected increases in general freight levels  implementing a yield management program in which the company seeks additional favorable freight while ceasing to haul less favorable freight  and identifying additional areas for cost containment  including  personnel costs and liability insurance and claims 
in addition to these steps  management is working with a consulting firm to identify and evaluate additional measures to achieve and enhance profitability over the longer term 
although management believes that seasonal improvements in shipping demand and the actions being evaluated should generate the required improvements  there is no assurance that the improvements will occur as planned 
although there can be no assurance  management believes that cash generated by operations and available sources of financing for acquisitions of revenue equipment  although such sources are limited  will be adequate to meet its currently anticipated working capital requirements and other cash needs through to the extent that actual results or events differ from management s financial projections or business plans  the company s liquidity may be adversely affected and the company may be unable to meet its financial covenants 
specifically  the company s liquidity may be adversely affected by one or more of the following factors continuing weak freight demand or a loss in customer relationships or volume  the ability to attract and retain sufficient numbers of qualified drivers and owner operators  elevated fuel prices and the ability to collect fuel surcharges  costs associated with insurance and claims  inability to maintain compliance with  or negotiate amendments to  loan covenants  the ability to finance the tractors and trailers delivered and scheduled for delivery  and the possibility of shortened payment terms by the company s suppliers and vendors worried about the company s ability to meet payment obligations 
except for financing for approximately tractors and trailers  the company expects to fund its cash requirements primarily with cash generated from operations and revolving borrowings under its bank financing 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
historically  the company s principal use of cash from operations is to service debt and to internally finance acquisitions of revenue equipment 
total receivables decreased million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the average age of the company s trade accounts receivable was approximately days for  days for  and days for net cash used in provided by investing activities was million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
such amounts related primarily to purchases  sales  and trades of revenue equipment and payments made for the acquisition of skipper transportation  inc in net cash used in financing activities of million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively  consisted primarily of net payments of principal under the company s long term debt agreements 
the company has a financing arrangement with lasalle bank  which expires on april   and provides for automatic month to month renewals under certain conditions 
lasalle may terminate the arrangement prior to april   in the event of default  and may terminate at anytime during the renewal terms 
prior to recent amendments  the arrangement expired on december  the arrangement provides for a term loan  a revolving line of credit  a capital expenditure loan  and financing for letters of credit 
the combination of all loans with lasalle bank cannot exceed the lesser of million or a specified borrowing base 
at december   the term loan had a principal balance of million  payable in remaining equal monthly principal installments of  the revolving line of credit allows for borrowings up to percent of eligible receivables 
at december   total borrowings under the revolving line were million 
the capital expenditure loan allows for borrowing up to percent of the purchase price of revenue equipment purchased with such advances  provided borrowings under the capital expenditure loan are limited to million annually  and million over the term of the arrangement 
at december   the amount owed under capital expenditure notes was million 
at december   the company had outstanding letters of credit totaling million for self insured amounts under its insurance programs 
these letters of credit directly reduce the amount of potential borrowings available under the financing arrangement 
any increase in self insured retention  as well as increases in claim reserves  may require additional letters of credit to be posted  which would negatively affect the company s liquidity 
at december   the company s borrowing limit under the financing arrangement was million  leaving approximately million in remaining availability at such date 
at the date hereof  the company has relatively little availability 
the company is required to pay a facility fee on the lasalle financing arrangement of 
of the maximum loan limit million 
borrowings under the arrangement are secured by liens on revenue equipment  accounts receivable  and certain other assets 
in connection with an early march amendment  the interest rate on outstanding borrowings under the arrangement was increased from lasalle s prime rate to the prime rate plus two percent 
the lasalle financing arrangement requires compliance with certain financial covenants  including compliance with a minimum tangible net worth  capital expenditure limits  and a fixed charge coverage ratio 
the company was not in compliance with the tangible net worth or fixed charge covenants at december   or the tangible net worth covenant at march   but waivers were received 
these covenants have since been amended to requirements that management believes are reasonably achievable  although there can be no assurance that the required financial performance will be achieved 
in addition  equipment financing provided by a manufacturer contains a minimum tangible net worth requirement 
the company was in compliance with the required minimum tangible net worth requirement for december   but was not in compliance on march  a waiver was obtained and this covenant has since been amended 
management expects to remain in compliance going forward 
if the company fails to maintain compliance with these financial covenants  or to obtain a waiver of any noncompliance  the lenders will have the right to declare all sums immediately due and pursue other remedies 
in such an event  the company s liquidity would be materially and adversely impacted  and the company s ability to continue as a going concern would be called into question if alternative financing could not be found 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following tables set forth the contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of december  principal payments due by year in thousands less than after contractual obligations total one year years years years long term debt     operating leases total contractual cash obligations     the company had no other commercial commitments at december  critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make decisions based upon estimates  assumptions  and factors it considers as relevant to the circumstances 
such decisions include the selection of applicable accounting principles and the use of judgment in their application  the results of which impact reported amounts and disclosures 
changes in future economic conditions or other business circumstances may affect the outcomes of management s estimates and assumptions 
accordingly  actual results could differ from those anticipated 
a summary of the significant accounting policies followed in preparation of the financial statements is contained in note of the consolidated financial statements attached hereto 
other footnotes describe various elements of the financial statements and the assumptions on which specific amounts were determined 
the company s critical accounting policies include the following revenue recognition the company generally recognizes operating revenue when the freight to be transported has been loaded 
the company operates primarily in the short to medium length haul category of the trucking industry  therefore  the company s typical customer delivery is completed one day after pickup 
accordingly  this method of revenue recognition is not materially different from recognizing revenue based on completion of delivery 
the company recognizes operating revenue when the freight is delivered for longer haul loads where delivery is completed more than one day after pickup 
amounts payable to independent contractors for purchased transportation  to company drivers for wages  and other direct expenses are accrued when the related revenue is recognized 
property and equipment property and equipment are recorded at cost 
depreciation is provided by use of the straight line and declining balance methods over lives of to years for buildings and improvements  years for tractors  years for trailers  and to years for other equipment 
tires purchased as part of revenue equipment are capitalized as a cost of the equipment 
replacement tires are expensed when placed in service 
expenditures for maintenance and minor repairs are charged to operations  and expenditures for major replacements and betterments are capitalized 
the cost and related accumulated depreciation on property and equipment retired  traded  or sold are eliminated from the property accounts at the time of retirement  trade  or sale 
the gain or loss on retirement or sale is included in depreciation and amortization in the consolidated statements of operation 
gains or losses on trade ins are included in the basis of the new asset 
estimated liability for insurance claims losses resulting from auto liability  physical damage  workers compensation  and cargo loss and damage are covered by insurance subject to certain deductibles 
losses resulting from uninsured claims are recognized when such losses are known and can be estimated 
the company estimates and accrues a liability for its share of ultimate settlements using all available information 
the company accrues for claims reported  as well as for claims incurred but not reported  based upon the company s past experience 
expenses depend on actual loss experience and changes in estimates of settlement amounts for open claims which have not been fully resolved 
however  final settlement of these claims could differ materially from the amounts the company has accrued at year end 
management s judgment concerning the ultimate cost of claims and modification of initial reserved amounts is an important part of establishing claims reserves  and is of increasing significance with higher self insured retention 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
management s judgment concerning future cash flows is an important part of this determination 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less the costs to sell 
the company has decided to maintain its revenue equipment for the foreseeable future and not replace aging tractors 
if resale values remain at current levels or decline  the company may incur increased maintenance costs and a lower gain or loss on sale resulting from retaining equipment even longer 
new accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas supercedes eitf no 
the principal difference between sfas and eitf no 
relates to when an entity can recognize a liability related to exit or disposal activities 
sfas requires a liability be recognized for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity when the liability is incurred 
eitf no 
allowed a liability  related to an exit or disposal activity  to be recognized at the date an entity commits to an exit plan 
the provisions of sfas are effective on january  accordingly  we will apply this standard to all exit or disposal activities initiated after january  in november  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
this interpretation elaborates on disclosure requirements of obligations by a guarantor under certain guarantees 
this interpretation also requires a guarantor to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of an obligation undertaken in issuing a guarantee 
we will apply the provisions of interpretation no 
for initial recognition and measurement provisions to guarantees issued or modified after december   as required 
we did not have any guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  as of december   which would require disclosure under interpretation no 
related party transactions during the years ended december    and  there were no material transactions with related parties 
inflation and fuel costs most of the company s operating expenses are inflation sensitive  with inflation generally producing increased costs of operation 
during the past three years  the most significant effects of inflation have been on revenue equipment prices  the compensation paid to drivers  and fuel prices 
innovations in equipment technology and comfort have resulted in higher tractor prices  and there has been an industry wide increase in wages paid to attract and retain qualified drivers 
the company attempts to limit the effects of inflation through increases in freight rates and certain cost control efforts 
the failure to obtain rate increases in the future could adversely affect profitability 
high fuel prices also decrease the company s profitability 
most of the company s contracts with customers contain fuel surcharge provisions 
although the company attempts to pass through increases in fuel prices to customers in the form of surcharges and higher rates  the fuel price increases are not fully recovered 
seasonality in the trucking industry results of operations show a seasonal pattern because customers generally reduce shipments during the winter season  and the company experiences some seasonality due to the open  flatbed nature of the majority of its trailers 
the company at times has experienced delays in meeting its shipment schedules as a result of severe weather conditions  particularly during the winter months 
in addition  the company s operating expenses have been higher in the winter months due to decreased fuel efficiency and increased maintenance costs in colder weather 
factors that may affect future results the company may from time to time make written or oral forward looking statements 
written forward looking statements may appear in documents filed with the securities and exchange commission  in press releases  and in reports to stockholders 
the private securities litigation reform act of contains a safe harbor for forward looking statements 
the company relies on this safe harbor in making such disclosures 
in connection with this safe harbor provision  the company is hereby identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statement made by or on behalf of the company 
factors that might cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  the following operating losses and liquidity concerns 
the company has reported operating losses for the past three years 
failure to turn around the operating losses could result in further violation of bank covenants  which could accelerate the company s debt at several financial institutions 
in such an event  the company s liquidity would be materially and adversely impacted  and the company s ability to continue as a going concern would be called into question if alternative financing could not be found 
continued operating losses also could impair the company s ability to replace capital assets on the desired schedule  which could raise operating expenses 
if operating losses continue  suppliers and vendors worried about the company s ability to meet payment obligations could shorten payment terms or refuse to do business with the company  which would further heighten liquidity concerns 
in addition  customers could reduce or eliminate the amount of business they do with the company 
any of the foregoing could have a materially adverse effect on the company s operating results and liquidity 
general economic and business factors 
the company s business is dependent upon a number of factors that may have a materially adverse effect on its results of operations  many of which are beyond the company s control 
these factors include excess capacity in the trucking industry  significant increases or rapid fluctuations in fuel prices  interest rates  fuel taxes  and insurance and claims costs  to the extent not offset by increases in freight rates or fuel surcharges 
the company s results of operations also are affected by recessionary economic cycles and downturns in customers business cycles  particularly in market segments and industries in which the company has a concentration of customers 
in addition  the company s results of operations are affected by seasonal factors 
customers tend to reduce shipments during the winter months 
due to pending concerns in the middle east and the strike in venezuela  fuel prices have risen over the last three quarters of  and continuing into shortages of fuel  increases in fuel prices  or rationing of petroleum products could have a materially adverse effect on the company s operating results 
capital requirements 
the trucking industry is very capital intensive 
historically  the company has depended on cash from operations  operating leases  and debt financing for funds to maintain its revenue equipment fleet 
the company has slowed its growth and extended its trade cycle on tractors and trailers  and expects only minimal capital expenditures in if the company s operating results do not improve  and the company is unable in the future to enter into acceptable financing arrangements  it might be required to operate its revenue equipment for even longer periods or downsize its fleet  which could have a materially adverse effect on the company s operating results 
the failure of the company to maintain compliance with all covenants in its borrowing obligations  or obtain a waiver or amendment thereof  could have a materially adverse effect on the company s liquidity and operating results 
revenue equipment 
the company has decided to maintain its revenue equipment for the foreseeable future and not replace aging tractors 
if the resale value of the company s revenue equipment were to remain low or decline  the company could find it necessary to dispose of its equipment at a lower gain or a loss  or retain some of its equipment even longer  with a resulting increase in operating expenses  all of which could have a materially adverse effect on the company s operating results 
recruitment  retention  and compensation of qualified drivers and independent contractors 
competition for drivers and independent contractors is intense in the trucking industry 
there is  and historically has been  an industry wide shortage of qualified drivers and independent contractors 
the company has suffered from an excessive number of company owned tractors without drivers for the past several quarters 
in addition  independent contractors have decreased industry wide for a variety of economic reasons 
the company s shortage of drivers and independent contractors has constrained revenue production 
failure to recruit additional drivers and independent contractors could force the company to increase compensation or limit fleet size  either of which could have a materially adverse effect on operating results 
competition 
the trucking industry is highly competitive and fragmented 
the company competes with other truckload carriers  private fleets operated by existing and potential customers  and to some extent railroads and rail intermodal service 
competition is based primarily on service  efficiency  and freight rates 
many competitors offer transportation service at lower rates than the company 
the company s results could suffer if it cannot obtain higher rates 
acquisitions 
a significant portion of the company s growth prior to occurred through acquisitions 
in march  the company acquired the assets of skipper transportation  inc  a small flatbed carrier headquartered in birmingham  alabama

this variable interest exposes the company to the risk that interest rates may rise 
assuming borrowing levels at december   a one point increase in the prime rate would increase interest expense by approximately  the remainder of the company s other debt carries fixed interest rates and exposes the company to the risk that interest rates may fall 
at december   approximately of the company s debt carries a variable interest rate and the remainder is fixed
