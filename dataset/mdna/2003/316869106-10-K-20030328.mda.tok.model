these forward looking statements are subject to a number o f risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materiall y from those that may be anticipated by such forward looking statements  whic h reflect management s opinions only as of the date hereof 
we undertake n o obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revisions to thes e forward looking statements 
readers should carefully review the risk factors an d various disclosures described in this document and in other documents we fil e with the securities and exchange commission that attempt to advise intereste d parties of the risks and factors that may affect our business 
the followin g discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financia l statements and notes thereto submitted as a separate section of this form k item 
critical accounting policies and estimates the consolidated financial statements of filenet are prepared in conformit y with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the consolidated financial statements include our accounts and the accounts o f our wholly owned subsidiaries 
all intercompany balances and transactions hav e been eliminated 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity wit h accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of americ a requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reporte d amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements an d the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
th e significant accounting policies we believe are most critical to aid in full y understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include th e following revenue recognition 
filenet accounts for the licensing of software i n accordance with the american institute of certified accountants aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition 
we ente r into contracts for the sale of our products and services 
the majority of thes e contracts relates to single elements and contains standard terms and conditions however  there are agreements that contain multiple elements or non standar d terms and conditions 
contract interpretation is sometimes required to determin e the appropriate accounting  including how the price should be allocated amon g the deliverable elements and when to recognize revenue 
software license revenues generated from sales through direct and indirec t channels  which do not contain multiple elements  are recognized upon shipmen t of the related product  if the requirements of sop  are met 
if th e requirements of sop  including evidence of an arrangement  delivery  fixe d or determinable fee  collectibility or vendor specific evidence about the valu e of an element are not met at the date of shipment  revenue is not recognize d until these elements are known or resolved 
fees are deemed to be fixed an d determinable for transactions with a set price that is not subject to refund o r adjustment and payment is due within days from the invoice date 
softwar e license revenue from channel partners is recognized when the product is shippe d and sale by the channel partner to an end user is confirmed 
for arrangements with multiple elements  we allocate revenue to eac h element of a transaction based upon its fair value as determined in reliance o n vendor specific objective evidence 
this evidence of fair value for all element s of an arrangement is based on the normal pricing and discounting practices fo r those products and services when sold separately 
if fair value of an y undelivered element cannot be determined objectively  we defer the revenue unti l all elements are delivered  services have been performed or until fair value ca n objectively be determined 
customer support contracts are renewable on an annual basis and provid e after sale support for our software  as well as software upgrades under th e company s right to new versions program  on a when and if available basis revenue from post contract customer support is recognized ratably over the ter m of the arrangement  which is typically twelve months 
professional services revenue consists of consulting and implementatio n services provided to end users of our software products and technical consultin g services provided to our resellers 
the majority of these consulting engagement s average from one to three months and are generally not essential to th e functionality of the software 
revenue from these services and from trainin g classes is recognized as such services are delivered and accepted by th e customer 
fixed price consulting contracts are the exception and becaus e estimates of costs applicable to these contracts are reasonably dependable revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion method 
however revenue and profit is subject to revision as the contract progresses an d anticipated losses on fixed price professional services contracts are recognize d in the period when they become known 
allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns 
we evaluate th e creditworthiness of our customers prior to order fulfillment and we perfor m ongoing credit evaluations of our customers to adjust credit limits based o n payment history and the customer s current creditworthiness 
we constantl y monitor collections from our customers and maintain an allowance for estimate d credit losses that is based on historical experience and on specific custome r collection issues 
while credit losses have historically been within ou r expectations and the provisions established in our financial statements  w e cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rate s that we have in the past 
since our revenue recognition policy require s customers to be creditworthy  our accounts receivable are based on customer s whose payment is reasonably assured 
our accounts receivable are derived fro m sales to a wide variety of customers 
we do not believe a change in liquidity o f any one customer or our inability to collect from any one customer would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position 
based o n historical experience  we also maintain a sales return allowance for th e estimated amount of potential returns 
while product returns have historicall y been minimal and within our expectations and the allowances established by us we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same return rate s that we have in the past 
the following table represents the account balances for these provision s and the changes for each of the periods presented 
deductions to thes e provisions are the result of customer bad debt write offs or product returns additions to the provision are based on estimated credit losses related t o specific customer collection issues and are also based on historical experience in thousands additions balance at charged to balance beginning revenue and at end of period expenses deduction s of period year ended december  allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns    year ended december  allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns    year ended december  allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns    deferred income taxes 
deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects o f temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities fo r financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
w e maintain a valuation allowance against a portion of the deferred tax assets du e to uncertainty regarding the future realization based on historical taxabl e income  projected future taxable income  and the expected timing of th e reversals of existing temporary differences 
if we operate at a loss or ar e unable to generate sufficient future taxable income we could be required t o increase the valuation allowance against all or a significant portion of ou r deferred tax assets which would result in a substantial increase to ou r effective tax rate and could result in a material adverse impact on ou r consolidated operating results 
long lived assets 
in the first quarter of fiscal  the company adopte d statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for th e impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

sfas no 
establishes a single accounting model  based on the framework established i n statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for th e impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas no 
 for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  and resolve s implementation issues related to sfas no 
the adoption of sfas no 
di d not have a material impact on the company s operating results or financia l position 
property  plant and equipment  intangible assets  and capitalized softwar e costs are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization 
the y are amortized using the straight line method over estimated useful lives o f three to six years 
the determination of useful lives and whether or not thes e assets are impaired involves judgment and are reviewed for impairment wheneve r events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may no t be recoverable 
we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets and certai n identifiable intangible assets for impairment of value based on undiscounte d future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventua l disposition 
while we have not experienced impairment of intangible assets i n prior periods  we cannot guarantee that there will not be impairment in th e future 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill is recorded at cost and i s not amortized 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and othe r intangible assets  which we adopted january  sfas no 
requires tha t goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer b e amortized  but instead be tested for impairment at least annually and writte n down when impaired 
we periodically evaluate whether events and circumstance s have occurred which indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not b e recoverable 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we were required to perform a two step transitional impairment review 
we completed the first step of thi s review by june  with the determination of the fair value of ou r reporting units in order to identify whether the fair value of each reportin g unit was less than its carrying amount as of january  in the event tha t the fair value of each reporting unit was less than the carrying amount  th e second step of the test was required to determine if the carrying value o f goodwill exceeded the implied value 
we determined that we did not have a transitional impairment of goodwill because the fair value of each reportin g unit exceeded its carrying amount 
as of december   no impairment o f goodwill has been recognized 
goodwill will also be tested for impairment in th e manner described above on july st of each year or earlier if indicators o f potential impairment exist 
if estimates change  a materially differen t impairment conclusion could result 
other operating matters we took selective actions in to help drive profitability and to reduc e on going annual expenses 
these actions included cost saving measures  interna l business process changes to improve efficiency and a worldwide workforc e reduction of employees 
workforce reductions occurred during the second an d fourth quarters of resulting in a total severance charge of million these severance charges were  in customer support   i n professional services   in research and development and million i n selling  general and administrative  as discussed below 
overview filenet develops  markets  sells and supports a unified platform an d framework for enterprise content management  or ecm  that delivers capabilitie s to our customers in a tightly integrated and synchronized offering 
thi s approach offers our customers the ability to easily configure  design  build an d deploy ecm software and solutions 
we operate globally and sell our products an d services to our customers through a direct sales force  system integrators resellers and value added distributors 
we invest significantly in produc t development to improve our existing products and increase our product offerings our revenue growth depends on the overall demand for computer software an d services primarily to corporate and government customers 
a difficul t environment for information technology it sales that began in early an d continued through caused many customers to delay  downsize or cancel i t projects  resulting in lower demand and a reduction in our revenues fro m software and hardware sales 
we do not anticipate market conditions to improv e significantly in the near term 
despite the unpredictability of the curren t business environment  we remain focused on our strategy to provide a unifie d platform and framework for ecm solutions 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain consolidated statement of operation s data as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated as a percentage of total revenue december  revenue software customer support professional services and education hardware total revenue cost of revenue software customer support professional services and education hardware total cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative in process research and development total operating expenses operating income loss other income  net income loss before tax revenue total revenue increased to million  or in from million in from to  total revenue decreased from million or 
the increase in total revenue from to was primaril y attributable to an increase in demand for our software products as well as th e growth in customer support revenue partially offset by lower professiona l services and hardware revenue as discussed below 
the decrease in total revenu e from to was primarily attributable to lower software revenue as a result of unfavorable economic conditions in resulting in decreased deman d for our software products partially offset by an increase in customer suppor t and professional services revenues 
software 
software revenue consists of fees earned from the licensing o f our software products to customers 
software revenue increased to millio n in from million in  representing an increase of million or 
from to  software revenue decreased million from million  or 
the increase in software revenue from to wa s primarily due to an increase in demand for content management solution s primarily attributable to broader product offerings in coupled with a slightly improved it spending environment 
additionally  we were successful i n increasing software revenues from our existing customers as they expanded th e use of our products 
the decrease from to was primarily due to th e significant global economic slowdown in the technology sector that resulted in a significant reduction in the amount and size of customer orders 
larg e enterprise projects were eliminated or replaced by smaller projects as i t budgets were reduced and delayed in both and continued in we expec t that the trend toward smaller projects will continue for the foreseeable futur e and we do not anticipate market conditions will improve significantly in th e near term 
customer support 
customer support revenue consists of revenue fro m software maintenance contracts and fee for service revenues and the sale o f spare parts and supplies 
customer support revenue increased to millio n in from million in  representing an increase of million or 
from to  customer support revenue increased by millio n from million  or 
these increases in customer support revenue reflec t an increase in the overall customer installed base combined with a high rate o f renewal in the existing customer base 
customer support revenue grew more slowl y in compared to the growth rate in as a result of the decrease d software revenue in and a prolonged economic slowdown will continu e to affect the growth rate of customer support revenue as this revenue stream i s directly related to software revenue fluctuations over time 
professional services and education 
professional services and educatio n revenue is generated primarily from consulting and implementation services o n our standard products provided to end users of our software products  technica l consulting services provided to our resellers and training services professional services are generally performed on a time and material basis professional services and education revenue decreased to million in from million in  representing a decrease of million  or from to professional services and education revenue increased by million from million  or 
the decrease from to is reflectiv e of the economic slow down  particularly in north america  which resulted i n fewer and smaller consulting engagements and increased pricing pressures 
th e increase from to was primarily attributable to an increase in custo m development projects that carried over from  and to a lesser extent  a n increase in sales of prepackaged service offerings  which included bot h consulting and training 
a prolonged economic slowdown that causes companies t o delay spending on technology projects will continue to negatively impact thes e revenues 
hardware 
hardware revenue is generated primarily from the sale of ou r inch osar libraries 
hardware revenue decreased to million in fro m million in  representing a decrease of million  or 
fro m to hardware revenue decreased by million from million  o r 
the decline in hardware revenue reflects that hardware is not a strategi c focus for us and we expect hardware revenue to continue to decrease as a percen t of total revenue and in absolute dollars 
international 
international revenues accounted for of total revenue or million  in  of total revenue  or million  in  an d of total revenue  or million  in the increase in absolut e dollars in as compared to resulted primarily from increases i n software revenue and customer support revenue related to an increase in th e overall customer base and a high rate of renewal 
the decrease in absolut e dollars in as compared to was primarily the result of a significan t reduction in the amount and size of customer orders in europe and asia  ou r largest international markets  due to a major slowdown in it spending 
we expec t international revenue to continue to represent a significant percentage of tota l revenue 
however  international revenues will be adversely affected if the u 
s dollar strengthens against certain major international currencies or if economi c conditions remain weak 
cost of revenue total cost of revenue decreased to million in  from million in  representing a decrease of million  or 
from t o total cost of revenue decreased by million  or 
total cost o f revenue decreased from to primarily due to reduced costs in th e service organizations and the hardware component as discussed below 
th e decrease in total cost of revenue from to is primarily attributable t o lower software and hardware costs that can be directly related to lower softwar e and hardware revenue  as well as the discontinuation of certain third part y embedded products 
software 
cost of software revenue includes royalties paid to thir d parties  amortization of acquired technology  media costs  and the cost t o manufacture and distribute software 
the cost of software revenue was million in  million in and million in  representin g  and of software revenue  respectively 
the increase in cost o f software revenue for compared to is primarily the result of a increase in royalty costs due to increased utilization of new third part y software products in and the amortization of acquired technology resultin g from the egrail acquisition in april which was  for compare d to none in cost of software revenue decreased from to resultin g from a reduction in royalty cost due to the discontinuation of certain thir d party products along with a decrease in royalty costs directly related to th e decrease in revenue 
going forward we anticipate cost of software revenue t o remain comparable to current levels or increase slightly as we continue t o integrate third party technology with our products 
customer support 
cost of customer support revenue includes the cost o f customer support personnel  supplies and spare parts  and the cost o f third party hardware maintenance 
the cost of customer support revenue was million in  million in and million in  representin g   and of customer support revenue  respectively 
efficiency gain s and headcount reductions in contributed to the overall reduction i n customer support costs in as compared to the decrease in fro m was primarily attributable to a reduction in variable compensation an d personnel costs as well as cost reduction benefits from process improvement s initiated in workforce reductions in resulted in severance costs o f  that were absorbed by the benefit of ongoing reduced salary an d personnel expenses for and future periods 
due to increased productivit y and controls over headcount we expect to maintain these cost efficiencies fo r the near future 
professional services and education 
cost of professional services an d education revenue consists primarily of the costs of professional service s personnel  training personnel  and third party contractors 
the cost o f professional services and education revenue was million in  million in and million in  representing  and o f professional services and education revenue  respectively 
lower professiona l services and education revenue in resulted in lower costs in absolut e dollars compared to primarily due to a reduction in the use o f third party independent consultants  as well as lower variable compensatio n expense in the increase in absolute dollars from to wa s primarily due to an increase of in personnel costs as a result of averag e headcount increases along with a increase in the use of third part y independent contractors who were needed to complete development projects tha t carried over from additionally  we recorded a charge of approximatel y  for severance payments in expressed as a percentage of revenue costs were essentially unchanged from to we expect professiona l services and education costs as a percentage of professional services an d education revenue to vary from period to period depending on the utilizatio n rates of internal resources and the mix between internal and external servic e providers 
hardware 
cost of hardware revenue includes the cost of assembling our osa r library products  the cost of hardware integration personnel  warranty costs an d distribution costs 
the cost of hardware revenue was million in  million in and million in  representing  and o f hardware revenue  respectively 
the year to year decreases in absolute dollar s are directly related to decreased hardware revenue 
hardware cost as a percen t of hardware revenue has not decreased proportionally because fixed costs hav e not decreased at the same rate as hardware revenue 
operating expenses research and development 
research and development expense consist s primarily of personnel costs for software developers  third party contracte d development efforts and related facilities costs 
research and developmen t expense was million in  million in and million i n  representing  and of total revenue  respectively 
th e acquisition of egrail in accounted for the majority of the millio n increase in research and development expenses from to primarily due t o additional facility and headcount expenses 
the increase in expense from t o was primarily due to the initiation of extensive development efforts t o enhance existing products with new capabilities and to develop new products this initiation resulted in a increase in compensation expense primarily du e to increased numbers of personnel from in fiscal to in fiscal as well as a increase in consulting costs due to the expanded use o f contractors 
also included in the costs were a one time bonus of million related to the application partners  incorporated api acquisitio n and severance costs of approximately  our research and development efforts are focused on providing a unifie d platform and framework for enterprise content management that delive r capabilities to our customers in a tightly integrated and synchronized offering this approach offers our customers the ability to easily configure  design build and deploy ecm solutions 
these efforts focus on improvements in busines s process management  content management  web content management and associate d applications to provide a richer product offering to our customers 
we intend t o continue to complement internal development with third party software throug h oem agreements and may execute additional technology acquisitions such as ou r egrail acquisition that took place in april new product development underway at egrail at the time of the acquisitio n included the next generation of their web content management product that was i n the early stages of design and only complete at the date of the acquisition the cost to complete the project was estimated at approximately million t o occur over a twelve month period 
as of december  the project is complete and the company has incurred approximately million of research an d development expenses related to the project 
the revised estimate to complet e the project within the estimated timeframe is an additional million i n costs 
we intend to continue to invest significantly in internal research an d development 
we expect that competition for qualified technical personnel  whil e easing due to the global economic slowdown in the short term  will remai n intense and may result in higher levels of compensation expense for us in th e future 
we believe that research and development expenditures  includin g compensation of technical personnel  are essential to maintaining ou r competitive position and expect these costs to continue to constitute a significant percentage of total revenue in future periods 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrativ e expense consists primarily of salaries  benefits  sales commissions and othe r expenses related to the direct and indirect sales force  personnel cost fo r marketing and market development programs  personnel costs for finance information technology  legal  human resources and general management  and th e cost of outside professional services 
selling  general and administrativ e expense was million in  million in and million i n selling  general and administrative expense  as a percentage of tota l revenue  was in  in and in the decrease in absolut e dollars from to was primarily due to a reduction in recruitmen t expenses  as well as a reduction in sales commission expense 
the larges t expense reduction was the elimination of goodwill and assembled workforc e amortization in  which was million in and million in we ceased amortizing goodwill and assembled workforce as of the beginning of th e first quarter of in compliance with sfas no 
assembled workforce n o longer meets the definition of a separately identified intangible asset unde r the provisions of sfas no 
 business combinations  and the unamortize d balance of  at december  was reclassified as goodwill at januar y  the increase in absolute dollars in from was primarily due t o overall increased expenses associated with the expansion of sales and marketin g for new product launch programs  a increase in depreciation expense fro m capitalized software systems  and a increase in legal fees 
charges in for severance of million related to workforc e reductions and  for facility consolidation costs  primarily in sales also contributed to the increase in from however  these workforc e reductions and facility consolidations led to reduced costs in we expec t to maintain expense controls over selling  general and administrative costs i n accordingly  these costs during should remain relatively consisten t with as a percentage of sales 
purchased in process research and development 
based upon an independen t third party appraisal determined through established valuation techniques in th e high tech industry  we allocated approximately million to in proces s research and development in connection with our purchase of certain assets fro m api in may the in process research and development expenses were relate d to new product projects that were under development at the date of th e acquisition and were expected to eventually lead to new products but had not ye t established feasibility and for which no future alternative use was identified the valuation of the in process research and development projects was based upo n the discounted expected future net cash flows of the products over thei r expected life  reflecting the estimated percent of completion of the project s and an estimate of the costs to complete the projects 
new product developmen t projects underway at api at the time of the acquisition included sequis  a n eservice application that we estimated to be complete at the date of th e acquisition 
the cost to complete the project was estimated at approximatel y  to occur over a three month period 
we incurred approximately  of research and development expenses related to the project that was complete as of september  our egrail acquisition in april of certain assets and certai n liabilities resulted in an allocation of  to in process research an d development 
the allocation was determined through established valuatio n techniques in the high technology industry by an independent third part y appraiser 
in process research and development was expensed upon acquisitio n because technological feasibility had not been established and no futur e alternative uses existed 
new product development underway at egrail at the tim e of the acquisition included the next generation of their web content managemen t product that was in the early stages of design and only complete at the dat e of the acquisition 
the cost to complete the project was estimated a t approximately million to occur over a twelve month period 
as of decembe r  the project was complete and the company has incurred approximatel y million of research and development expenses related to the project 
th e revised estimate to complete the project within the estimated timeframe is a n additional million in cost 
amortization of goodwill 
in connection with our acquisition of certai n assets from api on may   the purchase price amount allocated to goodwil l of million was being amortized in operating expenses over a useful life o f five years and assembled workforce of  was being amortized over a usefu l life of three years 
we ceased amortizing goodwill and assembled workforce as o f january  as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
assembled workforc e no longer meets the definition of a separately identified intangible asset unde r the provisions of sfas no 
 business combinations  and the unamortize d balance of  at december  was reclassified as goodwill at januar y  sfas no 
was also effective for business combinations that occurre d after june  accordingly  goodwill of million that was recorded i n april in connection with the egrail acquisition is not amortized 
we had n o indefinite life intangible assets as of january  we are required t o evaluate the carrying value of goodwill annually or when events or circumstance s indicate that their carrying value may be impaired 
in accordance with sfas no  we were required to perform a two step transitional impairment review 
w e completed the first step of this review by june  with the determinatio n of the fair value of our reporting units in order to identify whether the fai r value of each reporting unit was less than its carrying amount as of january in the event that the fair value of each reporting unit was less than th e carrying amount  the second step of the test was required to determine if th e carrying value of goodwill exceeded the implied value 
we determined that we di d not have a transitional impairment of goodwill because the fair value of eac h reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount 
there was no impairment of goodwil l at december  goodwill will also be tested for impairment in the manne r described above on july st of each year or earlier if indicators of potentia l impairment exist 
if estimates change  a materially different impairmen t conclusion could result 
amortization of purchased intangible assets 
acquired technology of million and patents of  were included in our acquisition of egrail acquired technology is being amortized over a useful life of five years an d patents are being amortized over a useful life of two years 
amortizatio n expense for purchased intangible assets was  for we determine d that these assets were not impaired at december  interest  other income and expenses  net 
other income  net consist s primarily of interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents  short an d long term investments  and other items including foreign exchange gains an d losses  and interest expense 
other income  net of other expenses  was million in  million in and million in the increase i n from was primarily attributable to a net foreign exchange gain of million for when compared to none for due to a significant weakenin g of the dollar against the euro in this was offset by lower interest incom e of million in compared to million in the weighted averag e interest rate earned on cash  cash equivalents and investments during decreased to from in finally  a million litigatio n settlement charge included in other expense in caused other income  net i n to be lower than both and provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes was millio n in  compared to a benefit of million in and a provision of million in the effective tax rate was  and for the year s ended december   and  respectively 
the increased tax rate i n was primarily due to the mix of income between domestic and foreig n jurisdictions 
filenet management will continue weighing various evidenc e throughout each year to assess the recoverability of its recorded deferre d assets and the need for any valuation allowance against such amounts 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   cash and cash equivalents  and investments wer e million  an increase of million from million at december cash provided by operating activities in was million an d resulted primarily from net income of million  and depreciation an d amortization of million 
these were partially offset by increased account s receivable of million resulting from increased revenue in the fourt h quarter of compared to  an increase of million in prepai d expenses such as prepaid insurance due to higher insurance premiums in an d increases in prepaid royalty related to the addition of new third part y licensing agreements in  and a decrease in income tax payable of million

our ability to increase revenues and generat e profits is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties and any significan t decrease in our revenues or profitability could reduce our operating cash flow s and erode our existing cash balances 
during and continuing into lowe r capital spending in the it sector resulted in lower revenue for us

based on this evaluation to date  we currently do no t believe that there has been or will be a material impact on our consolidate d financial condition or results of operations as a result of the euro conversion impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements 
in june  the fas b issued sfas no 
 business combinations  which was effective immediately sfas no 
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for al l business combinations initiated after june   and it eliminated th e pooling of interests method 
the adoption of this standard did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
our april acquisition of certain assets and certain liabilities of egrail  inc wa s accounted for in compliance with this pronouncement see note of notes t o consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangibl e assets  which we adopted january  sfas no 
requires that goodwil l and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized but instead be tested for impairment at least annually and written down whe n impaired 
sfas no 
requires purchased intangible assets other than goodwil l to be amortized over their useful lives unless these lives are determined to b e indefinite 
in accordance with this standard  we no longer amortize goodwill an d indefinite life intangible assets but evaluate their carrying value annually o r when events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may be impaired assembled workforce no longer meets the definition of a separately identifie d intangible asset under the provisions of sfas no 
 business combinations and the unamortized balance of  was reclassified as goodwill at januar y  we ceased amortizing the goodwill balance of million from ou r acquisition of applications partner  inc as of january  we had n o indefinite life intangible assets as of january  in accordance with sfa s no 
 we were required to perform a two step transitional impairment review we completed the first step of this review by june  with th e determination of the fair value of our reporting units in order to identif y whether the fair value of each reporting unit was less than its carrying amoun t as of january  in the event that the fair value of each reporting uni t was less than the carrying amount  the second step of the test would be require d to determine if the carrying value of goodwill exceeded the implied value 
w e determined that we did not have a transitional impairment of goodwill becaus e the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount 
as o f december   no impairment of goodwill has been recognized 
goodwill wil l also be tested for impairment in the manner described above on july st of eac h year or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist 
if estimate s change  a materially different impairment conclusion could result 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for impairment o r disposal of long lived assets 
this statement addresses financial accountin g and reporting for the impairment of long lived assets and for the disposal o f long lived assets and discontinued operations 
sfas no 
superseded sfas no  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long live d assets to be disposed of  and is effective for fiscal years beginning afte r december  the adoption of this standard on january  did not hav e a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
in november  the fasb announced emerging issues task force eitf topic no 
d  income statement characterization of reimbursements receive d for out of pocket expense incurred  is required to be applied in financia l reporting periods beginning after december  the eitf requires companie s to characterize reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses as revenue s in the statement of operations 
historically  we have netted reimbursement s received for out of pocket expenses against the related expenses in th e statement of operations 
application of this eitf requires that comparativ e financial statements for prior periods be reclassified to comply with th e guidance 
we adopted this eitf as of january  and have reclassified ou r prior period  consolidated financial statements to conform to the curren t presentation 
these reclassifications resulted in increased revenue and cost o f revenue of million and million for the twelve months ended decembe r  and  respectively 
the adoption of this eitf did not have a material effect on total revenues or gross margin percentages and has no impac t on results of operations as it required an equivalent increase to both revenu e and cost of revenue 
comparable amounts for are not available a s out of pocket expenses are characterized as revenue upon invoicing 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for cost s associated with exit or disposal activities  which addresses financia l accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activitie s and supersedes eitf issue  liability recognition for certain employe e termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certai n costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas requires that costs associate d with exit or disposal activities be recognized when they are incurred rathe r than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
sfas no 
als o establishes that the liability should initially be measured and recorded at fai r value 
we will adopt the provisions of sfas no 
for exit or disposa l activities that are initiated after december  in november  the fasb issued interpretation fin no 
guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  includin g indirect guarantees and indebtedness of others  an interpretation of fas b statements no 
 and  and rescission of fin no 
 disclosure o f indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin elaborates on th e disclosures to be made by the guarantor in its interim and annual financia l statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
i t also requires that a guarantor recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing th e guarantee 
the provisions related to recognizing a liability at inception of th e guarantee for the fair value of the guarantor s obligations does not apply t o product warranties or to guarantees accounted for as derivatives 
the initia l recognition and measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable o n a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  while the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements fo r interim or annual periods ending after december  our disclosure o f guarantees is included in note of the notes to consolidated financia l statements 
we believe the adoption of this interpretation will not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock base d compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of sfas no 
thi s statement amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  t o provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fai r value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
i n addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
t o require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statement s about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and th e effect of the method used on reported results 
the transition guidance an d annual disclosure provisions of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal yea rs ending after december  the interim disclosure provisions are effective for financia l reports containing financial statements for interim periods beginning afte r decemebr  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impac t on our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
in january  the fasb issued fin  consolidation of variabl e interest entities 
in general  a variable interest entity is a corporation partnership  trust  or any other legal structure used for business purposes tha t either a does not have equity investors with voting rights or b has equit y investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity t o support its activities 
fin requires a variable interest entity to b e consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the ris k of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
the consolidatio n requirements of fin apply immediately to variable interest entities create d after january  the consolidation requirements apply to older entitie s in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  certain of the disclosure requirements apply in all financial statements issue d after january   regardless of when the variable interest entity wa s established 
we did not have any variable interest entities as of december we are currently evaluating the provisions of the interpretation  bu t believe its adoption will not have a material impact on our consolidated result s of operations or our financial position 
inflation 
management believes that inflation has not had a significant impac t on the price of our products  the cost of our materials  or our operatin g results for any of the three years ended december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of risks  including changes in interest rate s affecting the return on investments and foreign currency fluctuations 
in th e normal course of business  we employ established policies and procedures t o manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currenc y values 
interest rate risk 
our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interes t rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we have not used derivativ e financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we place our investments wit h high quality issuers and  by policy  we limit the amount of credit exposure t o any one issuer 
we protect and preserve our invested funds by limiting default market and reinvestment risk 
our investments in marketable securities consis t primarily of high grade corporate and government securities with fixed interes t rates and maturities of less than three years 
investments purchased with a n original maturity of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents we classify all of our investments as available for sale 
available for sal e securities are carried at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses  net o f tax  reported in a separate component of stockholders equity 
at any time  a significant increase decrease in interest rates will have a n impact on the fair market value and interest earnings of our investmen t portfolio 
we do not currently hedge this interest rate exposure 
we hav e performed a sensitivity analysis as of december  and  using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical basis points and basis points adverse movement in the level s of interest rates across the entire yield curve  which are representative o f historical movements in the federal funds rate with all other variables hel d constant 
the analysis covers our investment and is based on the weighte d average maturity of our investments as of december  and th e sensitivity analysis indicated that a hypothetical basis points advers e movement in interest rates would result in a loss in the fair values of ou r investment instruments of approximately  at december  an d approximately  at december  similarly a hypothetical basi s points adverse movement in interest rates would result in a loss in the fai r values of our investments of approximately  at december  an d approximately  at december  foreign currency risk 
our performance can be affected by changes in foreig n currency values relative to the us dollar in relation to the company s revenu e and operating expenses 
we have entered into forward foreign exchange contract s primarily to hedge amounts due from and the net assets of selected subsidiarie s denominated in foreign currencies mainly in europe and asia pacific agains t fluctuations in exchange rates 
we have not entered into forward foreig n exchange contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
our accounting policie s for these contracts are based on our designation of the contracts as hedgin g transactions 
the criteria we use for designating a contract as a hedge includ e the contract s effectiveness in risk reduction and one to one matching o f derivative instruments to underlying transactions 
gains and losses on foreig n exchange contracts are recognized in income in the same period as gains an d losses on the underlying transactions 
if an underlying hedged transaction i s terminated earlier than initially anticipated  the offsetting gain or loss o n the related forward foreign exchange contract would be recognized in income i n the same period 
in addition  since we enter into forward contracts only as a hedge  any change in currency rates would not result in any material net gain o r loss  as any gain or loss on the underlying foreign currency denominated balanc e would be offset by the gain or loss on the forward contract 
our forwar d contracts generally have an original maturity of three months 
the tota l notional values of forward contracts purchased and forward contracts sold i n were million and million  respectively 
we do not expect gain s or losses on these contracts to have a material impact on our consolidate d financial results see note
