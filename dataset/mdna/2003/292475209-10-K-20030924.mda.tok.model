forward looking statements certain statements contained in this form k may constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of we may also make forward looking statements in other reports filed with the securities and exchange commission  in materials delivered to stockholders and in press releases 
in addition  our representatives may from time to time make oral forward looking statements 
forward looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact 
words such as anticipates  in the opinion  believes  intends  expects  may  will  should  could  plans  forecasts  estimates  predicts  projects  potential  continue and similar expressions may be intended to identify forward looking statements 
actual future results could differ materially from those described in the forward looking statements as a result of a variety of factors  including those discussed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations set forth below  and  in particular  the subsection entitled risk factors in part i  item of this form k elsewhere herein 
these factors include the fact that the economy generally  and the technology and storage segments specifically  have recently been in a state of uncertainty making it difficult to determine if past experience is a good guide to the future or if markets will grow or shrink in the short term 
recently  our results have been significantly impacted by a widespread slowdown in information technology spending that has also pressured the storage networking market that is the mainstay of our business 
a prolonged downturn in information technology spending could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
as a result of this uncertainty  we are unable to predict with any accuracy what future results might be 
other factors affecting these forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  the following slower than expected growth of the storage networking market or the failure of our original equipment manufacturer  or oem  customers to successfully incorporate our products into their systems  our dependence on a limited number of customers and the effects of the loss of  or decrease or delays in orders by  any such customers  or the failure of such customers to make payment  the emergence of new or stronger competitors  the timing and market acceptance of our or our oem customers new or enhanced products  the variability in the level of our backlog and the variable booking patterns of our customers  the effects of terrorist activities and resulting political or economic instability  the highly competitive nature of the markets for our products as well as pricing pressures that may result from such competitive conditions  our ability and the ability of our oem customers to keep pace with the rapid technological changes in our industry and gain market acceptance for new products and technologies  the effect of rapid migration of customers toward newer product platforms  possible transitions from board level to application specific integrated circuit  or asic  solutions for selected applications  a shift in unit product mix from high end to midrange products  a decrease in the average unit selling prices or an increase in the manufactured cost of our products  delays in product development  our reliance on third party suppliers and subcontractors for components and assembly  any inadequacy of our intellectual property protection or the potential for third party claims of infringement  our ability to attract and retain key technical personnel  our dependence on foreign sales  the effect of our stock price on stock compensation charges  the effect of acquisitions  changes in federal  international  or state and local income tax laws or rates  or changes in accounting standards 
readers should carefully review these cautionary statements as they identify certain important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements and from historical trends and are in addition to other factors discussed elsewhere in this form k  in our filings with the securities and exchange commission or in materials incorporated therein by reference 
we caution the reader  however  that these lists of risk factors may not be

we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or changes to these forward looking statements that may be made to reflect any future events or circumstances 
business combination in march  we acquired giganet  a privately held developer of storage networking products based on ethernet and ip technologies 
the acquisition has been included in the consolidated balance sheets and the operating results of giganet have been included in the consolidated statements of operations since the acquisition date  march  effective july   giganet was merged with and into emulex corporation  a california corporation that is our primary operating subsidiary 
results of operations for emulex corporation and subsidiaries the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 
all references to years refer to our fiscal years ended june   june   and july   as applicable  unless the calendar year is specified 
the following table sets forth certain financial data for the years indicated as a percentage of revenues 
percentage of net revenues net revenues fibre channel ip networking traditional networking and other total net revenues cost of sales gross profit operating expenses engineering and development selling and marketing general and administrative amortization of goodwill and other intangibles in process research and development total operating expenses operating income loss nonoperating income interest income interest expense other income expense net gain on repurchase of convertible subordinated notes total non operating income income loss before income taxes income tax provision benefit net income loss fiscal versus fiscal net revenues 
net revenues for increased million  or percent  to million  compared to from a product line perspective  net revenues generated from our fibre channel products for were million  an increase of million  or percent  compared to  and represented percent of total net revenues for we continue to believe that our net revenues from our fibre channel products are being generated primarily as a result of our product certifications and qualifications with oem customers  which take product both directly and through distribution channels 

table of contents net revenues by product line percentage percentage of net of net increase percentage in thousands revenues revenues decrease change fibre channel ip networking traditional networking total net revenues our ip networking products consist of both our iscsi products  which are currently in development  and vi products  as well as legacy clan products 
we expect that our vi  clan and traditional networking products  which have all entered end of life status  will contribute negligible revenues to succeeding quarters 
although we continue to devote resources to iscsi product development  the market remains in an early stage of development and we do not expect material revenue from these products for the foreseeable future 
in addition to direct sales  some of our larger oem customers purchased or marketed products indirectly through distributors  resellers or other third parties 
customers with direct revenues only or total direct and indirect revenues  including customer specific models purchased or marketed indirectly through distributors  resellers  and other third parties  of more than percent were as follows net revenues by major customers direct revenues total direct and indirect revenues net revenue percentage hewlett packard ibm emc amounts less than percent are not presented fiscal hewlett packard percentages represent the combined revenues of hewlett packard and compaq direct sales to our top five customers accounted for percent of total net revenues in compared to percent in and we expect to be similarly concentrated in the future 
our net revenues from our customers can be significantly impacted by changes in the business models of our customers 
beginning in late  emc began sourcing more product through distribution rather than purchasing it directly 
consequently  direct sales to emc have been impacted 
additionally  emc has formed an alliance with dell and entered into a worldwide manufacturing agreement with dell 
consequently  some of our models previously sold under emc specific model numbers are now being sold under dell specific model numbers  and some net revenues for emc  including direct sales to emc and their customer specific models purchased indirectly through other distribution channels  have been shifted as a result of this dell alliance 
from a distribution channel perspective  net revenues generated from oem customers were percent of net revenues and sales through distribution were percent in our oem customers may take products both directly and through distribution channels 
net revenues by distribution channel percentage percentage of net of net increase percentage in thousands revenues revenues decrease change oem distribution end user total net revenues 
table of contents a major factor in the increased distribution net revenues is that beginning in  one of our larger oem customers  emc  began sourcing more product through distribution rather than purchasing it directly 
in direct sales to emc decreased million while total direct and indirect sales to emc increased by million in compared to in domestic net revenues increased by million  or percent  and international net revenues increased by million  or percent  compared to net domestic and international revenues percentage percentage of net of net increase percentage in thousands revenues revenues decrease change domestic europe pacific rim total net revenues we believe the increases in domestic and international net revenues were principally a function of the overall size of the market for fibre channel products and increased market acceptance of our fibre channel products 
however  because we sell to oems and distributors who ultimately resell our products to their customers  the geographic mix of our net revenues may not be reflective of the geographic mix of end user demand or installations 
gross profit 
cost of sales included the cost of production of finished products as well as support costs and other expenses related to inventory management  manufacturing quality and order fulfillment 
in  gross profit increased million  or percent  to million  from million in gross margin increased to percent in  compared to percent in starting in late september  some of our major customers made announcements that general economic conditions  exacerbated by the increase in economic uncertainty in the aftermath of the terrorist events of september   were having a negative impact on their financial results 
the announcements made  and forecasts received  indicated deteriorating demand for our one gbps products as these customers were expected to migrate to two gbps products for future purchases 
as a result  we recorded an estimated excess and obsolete inventory charge totaling million during the first quarter of fiscal after initially recording the one gbps reserve during the first quarter of fiscal  we have subsequently reduced this reserve by a total of million through june   as previously reserved inventory has been sold 
overall  we have been able to recover a significant portion of this reserved inventory that was not expected based on our forecasts and the forecasts received from our customers when this excess and obsolete charge was recorded 
in addition to the sale of this previously reserved product  we have also scrapped million of this reserved inventory and negotiated and paid cancellation charges of million through june   related to this excess and obsolete inventory charge since it was initially recorded 
in and  the reduction related to our one gbps reserve was million and million  respectively 
excluding the reduction of the excess and obsolete inventory reserve of million in  and the net excess and obsolete inventory charge of million in  gross profit would have been million and million  respectively  and gross margin would have been percent and percent  respectively 
the increase in gross profit and gross margin in compared to was also due to cost reductions for fibre channel products  higher fibre channel net revenues and volumes and changes in product mix 
also  cost of sales included million and thousand of amortized deferred stock based compensation expense for and  respectively 
engineering and development 
engineering and development expenses consisted primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel engaged in the design  development and technical support of our products 
these expenses included third party fees paid to consultants  prototype development expenses and computer services costs related to supporting computer tools used in the engineering and design process 
engineering and development expenses were million and million for and  representing and percent of net revenues  respectively 
engineering and development expenses increased by million  or percent  in compared to this increase was due to our increased investment in fibre channel and ip engineering and development  which represented substantially all of our engineering and development efforts and expenses 
engineering expenses included million and million of amortized deferred stock based compensation for and  respectively 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses consisted primarily of salaries  commissions and related expenses for personnel engaged in the marketing and sales of our products  as well as trade shows  product literature  promotional support costs and other advertising related costs 
selling and marketing expenses were million and million for 
table of contents and  representing six and eight percent of net revenues  respectively 
selling and marketing expenses decreased by million  or two percent  in compared to this decrease was primarily due to a reduction in travel related expenses of million 
selling and marketing expenses included million and million of amortized deferred stock based compensation expenses for and  respectively 
as a portion of selling and marketing expenses is fixed  the expenses have not expanded at the same rate as our net revenues 
general and administrative 
ongoing general and administrative expenses consisted primarily of salaries and related expenses for executives  financial accounting support  human resources  administrative services  professional fees and other associated corporate expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million and million for and representing and five percent of net revenues  respectively 
general and administrative expenses increased by million  or percent  in compared to this increase was primarily due to a net charge of million associated with the tentative settlements of securities class action and derivative lawsuits 
excluding the net charge of million  general and administrative expenses were relatively flat as a portion of general and administrative expenses is fixed and the expenses have not expanded at the same rate as our net revenues 
general and administrative expenses included million and million of amortized deferred stock based compensation expenses for and  respectively 
amortization of goodwill and other intangibles 
amortization of goodwill and other intangibles included the amortization of intangible assets with estimable lives in and prior to the adoption of financial accounting standards board  or fasb  statement  or statement  amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets included the amortization of goodwill 
the amortization of intangibles was million in and amortization of goodwill and other intangibles was million in  representing two and percent of net revenues  respectively 
in  the amortization consisted of amortization for core technology and patents of million and thousand for completed technology 
in  the amortization consisted of million for goodwill and million for assembled workforce  as well as million for core technology and patents and thousand for completed technology 
we completed our transitional goodwill impairment analysis under statement during the first quarter of fiscal with no impairment charges resulting 
our annual impairment test occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal with no impairment charges resulting 
all intangible assets relate to the purchase of giganet  completed during fiscal nonoperating income 
nonoperating income consisted primarily of interest income  interest expense and other non operating income and expense items such as the gain on the repurchase of convertible subordinated notes 
our nonoperating income increased by million to million in from million in the increase is due primarily to a million gain on the repurchase of convertible subordinated notes in additionally  while lower interest rates caused lower interest percentage yields  the increase in our invested funds caused an increase in interest income to million in from million in the increase in interest income is offset in by a million increase in interest expense due to us having convertible subordinated notes outstanding for the entire year in versus only a portion of while the repurchase of convertible subordinated notes with a face value of million in the first quarter of fiscal had a proportionate reducing effect on the amount of interest expense recognized in  convertible subordinated notes were only outstanding for approximately five months in in addition  other expense included a loss of million on the sale of a strategic investment in income taxes 
in  we recorded a tax provision in the amount of million  or approximately percent of our income before income taxes 
we recorded a tax rate other than the statutory federal tax rate in principally due to state taxes in the united states 
in  we recorded a tax benefit in the amount of million 
we recorded a tax benefit at a rate other than the statutory federal tax rate in principally due to the non deductibility of goodwill amortization  and offset by the benefits related primarily to the release of the valuation allowance associated with deferred tax assets 
the release of the valuation allowance in resulted in an income tax benefit of million 
our valuation allowance was released as it was determined that it was more likely than not that the deferred tax asset related primarily to the net operating loss carryforwards and research credit carryforwards would be realized due to our projected future taxable income 
we expect to have a tax provision of approximately percent in future periods 
the internal revenue service recently completed an examination of our us tax return  and no adjustments were made to the return 

table of contents fiscal versus fiscal net revenues 
net revenues for were million  an increase of million  or four percent  from million in our net revenues consist primarily of sales to oems and distribution sales  which include sales to distributors  value added resellers  system integrators and similar companies 
the following chart details our net revenues by distribution channel for the and fiscal years net revenues by distribution channel percentage percentage of net of net increase percentage in thousands revenues revenues decrease change oem distribution end user total net revenues a major factor in this shift from oem to distribution net revenues is that one of our larger oem customers  emc  has sourced more product through distribution rather than purchasing it directly 
additionally  the widespread slowdown in technology investment has affected our oem and distribution customers at different times and in varying degrees of severity 
we continue to believe net revenues in this market are being generated primarily from oems taking product directly and through other distribution channels 
the following chart details our revenues by product line for the and fiscal years net revenues by product line percentage percentage of net of net increase percentage in thousands revenues revenues decrease change fibre channel ip networking traditional networking total net revenues during the second half of  we first experienced a downturn in fibre channel host bus adapter demand 
we believe industry wide decreases in end user demand for technology solutions caused this downturn in demand and caused the slowing in net revenue growth generated from fibre channel products 
ip storage networking products were added to our product offerings in the third quarter of with the acquisition of giganet 
consequently  the increase of million is due primarily to the inclusion of only approximately four months of net revenues for our ip storage networking products in compared to a full year in the decrease in net revenues from our traditional networking products was principally due to the ongoing maturation of these products and a decrease in our focus on these products 
our traditional networking products entered end of life status in and we expect that these will contribute negligible  if any  revenues in future periods 
in addition to direct sales  some of our larger oem customers purchased or marketed products indirectly through distributors  resellers or other third parties 
customers with direct revenues only or total direct and indirect revenues  including customer specific models purchased or marketed indirectly through distributors  resellers  and other third parties  of more than percent were as follows

we believe this increase in international net revenues of million  or percent  is a function of the overall size of the market for fibre channel products  increased market acceptance of our fibre channel products and an increase in demand from one international oem customer 
gross profit 
in  gross profit increased million  or six percent  to million from million in gross margin increased to percent in compared to percent in  but included a net excess and obsolete inventory charge of million during associated with older generation one gigabit products 
starting in late september  some of our major customers made announcements that general economic conditions  exacerbated by the increase in economic uncertainty in the aftermath of the terrorist events of september   were having a negative impact on their financial results 
the announcements made  and forecasts received  indicated deteriorating demand for our one gigabit products as these customers were expected to migrate to two gigabit products for future purchases 
as a result  we recorded an estimated excess and obsolete inventory charge totaling million during the first quarter of subsequently  as a result of generally improved demand exceeding prior estimates and the sale of products for which a reserve had been recorded  we recorded a reduction of million of this excess and obsolete inventory charge in excluding the net excess and obsolete inventory charge of million from  gross profit would have been million and gross margin would have been percent 
the increase in gross profit  excluding the net inventory charge  to million in from million in was primarily due to cost reductions for fibre channel products  higher fibre channel net revenues and changes in product mix  which more than offset the inclusion of costs associated with the former giganet operations  acquired in march with an acquisition date of march   the former giganet operations were included in expenses for approximately four months in compared to a full year in the improvement in gross margin in  excluding the net inventory charge  to percent compared to percent in  is primarily due to changes in product mix and the improved cost structures for our newer generation products 
additionally  cost of sales included thousand and thousand of amortized deferred compensation expense related to the acquisition of giganet in and  respectively 
engineering and development 
engineering and development expenses were million and million for and  representing and percent of net revenues  respectively 
engineering and development expenses increased by million  or percent  in compared to this increase of million was due to our increased investment in fibre channel and internet protocol product development  which represented substantially all of our engineering and development expenses 
the impact of the absorption of engineering and development expenses associated with the former 
table of contents giganet operations  which represented a major portion of our increased investment in fibre channel and internet protocol product development  for all of versus approximately four months of  was an estimated increase of approximately million 
engineering and development expenses included million and million of amortized deferred compensation expenses related to the acquisition of giganet for and  respectively 
due to the technical nature of our products  engineering support is a critical part of our strategy during both the development of our products and the support of our customers from product design through deployment into the market 
management intends to continue to make significant investments in the technical support and enhancement of our current products  as well as the continued development of new products 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses were million and million for and  representing eight and seven percent of net revenues  respectively 
the increase in selling and marketing expenses of million  or percent  was primarily due to increased salaries and commissions associated with additional employees and higher revenues of million  as well as increased promotion and advertising costs of million 
these increases included the impact of the absorption of the former giganet operations selling and marketing expenses for all of versus approximately four months of selling and marketing expenses included million and million of amortized deferred compensation expenses related to the acquisition of giganet for and  respectively 
additionally  we recognized million of amortized deferred compensation expense in both and associated with a change in the united kingdom s tax laws 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were million and million for and  respectively  representing five percent of net revenues in each year 
general and administrative expenses remained relatively flat for  compared to  due to our emphasis on operating expense controls  which offset the absorption of our former giganet operations general and administrative expenses for a full year in versus approximately four months in general and administrative expenses included million and million of amortized deferred compensation expenses related to the acquisition of giganet for and  respectively 
amortization of goodwill and other intangibles 
amortization of goodwill and other intangibles included the amortization of goodwill and other purchased intangible assets that related to the purchase of giganet  completed during the amortization of goodwill and other intangibles was million and million in and  representing and percent of net revenues  respectively 
in the amortization consisted of million and million for goodwill and assembled workforce  respectively  as well as million for core technology and patents and thousand for completed technology 
in  the amortization consisted of million and million for goodwill and assembled workforce  respectively  as well as million for core technology and patents and thousand for completed technology 
effective with our adoption of fasb statement at the beginning of our fiscal year  we no longer incur amortization expense associated with goodwill and assembled workforce 
we have completed our transitional impairment analysis under statement and no transitional impairment loss resulted upon the adoption of statement as of july  in process research and development 
in process research and development expense related to the purchase of giganet  completed during no in process research and development expenses were incurred in the in process research and development expense was million in  representing nine percent of net revenues 
nonoperating income 
nonoperating income consisted primarily of interest income partially offset by interest expense 
our nonoperating income decreased million to million in  compared to million in the decrease is due primarily to lower interest rates causing lower interest income on our investments as well as a loss of million on the sale of strategic investment during the decrease in nonoperating income is also due to a gain of million from the sale of a strategic investment during and million of interest earned on a pre acquisition note from giganet during in  interest expense of million associated with our issuance of convertible subordinated notes in was included 
income taxes 
in  we recorded a tax benefit in the amount of million 
we recorded the tax benefit at a rate other than the statutory federal tax rate principally due to the non deductibility of goodwill amortization  and offset by the benefits related primarily to the release of the valuation allowance associated with deferred tax assets 
the release of the valuation allowance in resulted in an income tax benefit of million 
our valuation allowance was released as it was determined that it was more likely than not that the deferred tax asset related primarily to the net operating loss carryforwards and research credit carryforwards would be realized due to our projection of future taxable income 
in  we recorded a tax provision in the amount of million 
we recorded a tax provision rather than a tax benefit in  and at a rate other than the statutory federal tax rate  primarily due to the non deductibility of both the goodwill amortization and the in process research and development charge 

table of contents new accounting standards the emerging issues task force  or eitf  recently reached a consensus on its tentative conclusions for eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf provides accounting guidance for customer solutions where delivery or performance of products  services and or performance may occur at different points in time or over different periods of time 
companies are required to adopt this consensus for fiscal periods beginning after june  we believe the adoption of eitf will not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
interpretation addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities 
interpretation applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
it applies in the first year or interim period beginning after june   to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  we do not believe that we have any variable interest entities to which interpretation would apply

critical accounting policies the preparation of the financial statements requires estimation and judgment that affect the reported amounts of net revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we have identified the following as critical accounting policies revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  goodwill  other intangibles and long lived assets  inventories  income taxes and stock based compensation 
revenue recognition 
our revenue recognition policies are in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
we recognize revenue at the time of shipment when title and risk of loss have passed  evidence of an arrangement has been obtained and collectibility has been reasonably assured 
we make certain sales through two tier distribution channels and have various distribution agreements with selected distributors and master value added resellers  or collectively the distributors 
these distribution agreements may be terminated upon written notice by either party 
additionally  these distributors are generally given privileges to return a portion of inventory and to participate in price protection and cooperative marketing programs 
therefore  we recognize revenues on our standard products sold to our distributors based on data received from the distributors and management s estimates to approximate the point that these products have been resold by the distributors 
as oem specific models sold to our distributors are governed under the related oem agreements rather than under these distribution agreements  we recognize revenue at the time of shipment to the distributors when title and risk of loss have passed  evidence of an arrangement has been obtained and collectibility has been reasonably assured 
additionally  we maintain accruals and allowances for price protection and cooperative marketing programs 

table of contents for products with unspecified software upgrade rights  which are our legacy clan products that contribute negligible revenues  we apply the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  or sop   software revenue recognition as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions 
under sop  as amended by sop  revenue is recognized from software licenses  provided the software has been delivered to the customer  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price charged to the customer is fixed or determinable at fair value  there are no significant company obligations related to the sale and the resulting receivable is deemed collectible  net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
in accordance with sop  as amended by sop  we have deferred the revenue over the upgrade period for certain legacy clan products with unspecified software upgrade rights 
furthermore  we provide a warranty of between one and three years on our fibre channel and internet protocol products and provide a warranty of between one and five years on our traditional networking products 
we record a provision for estimated warranty related costs at the time of sale based on historical product return rates and our expected future costs of fulfilling our warranty obligations 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon historical write offs as a percentage of net revenues 
although we have not experienced significant losses on accounts receivable historically  our accounts receivable are concentrated with a small number of customers 
consequently  any write off associated with one of these customers could have a significant impact on our allowance for doubtful accounts 
goodwill  other intangibles and long lived assets 
goodwill and other intangibles resulting from the acquisition of giganet are carried at cost less accumulated amortization 
for assets with determinable useful lives  amortization is computed using the straight line method over the estimated economic lives of the respective intangible assets  ranging from two to seven years 
we adopted statement effective july   and no longer amortize goodwill and other intangibles that have indeterminate useful lives 
the adoption of statement had a significant effect on our results of operations 
prior to the adoption for statement we applied statement for goodwill  other intangibles and long lived assets 
we completed our transitional impairment analysis under statement and found no impairment upon the adoption of statement as of july  our annual impairment test occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal with no impairment charges resulting 
in accordance with statement  goodwill and other intangibles that have indeterminate lives will be tested for impairment at least annually  but also on an interim basis if an event or circumstance indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment loss has been incurred 
any future impairment loss could materially and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 
we apply statement  under which the recoverability of long lived assets is assessed by determining whether the carrying value of an asset can be recovered through projected undiscounted future operating cash flows over its remaining life whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we may not be able to recover the asset s carrying value 
the amount of impairment  if any  is measured based on fair value  which is determined using projected discounted future operating cash flows 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value on a first in  first out basis 
we use a standard cost system for purposes of determining cost 
the standards are adjusted periodically to ensure they represent actual cost 
we regularly compare forecasted demand and the composition of the forecast against inventory on hand and open purchase commitments in an effort to ensure the carrying value of inventory does not exceed net realizable value 
accordingly  we may have to record reductions to the carrying value of excess and obsolete inventory if forecasted demand decreases 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method  which recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we regularly review historical and anticipated future pre tax results of operations to determine whether we will be able to realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance is required to reduce the potential deferred tax asset when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the potential deferred tax asset will not be realized due to the lack of sufficient taxable income 
stock based compensation 
we account for our stock based awards to employees using the intrinsic value method 
stock based awards to non employees  if any  are recorded using the fair value method 
see note and note of the consolidated financial statements for more information 
although we have no plans to adopt the fair value provisions of 
table of contents statement unless required to under new accounting standards for all stock awards  if we were required to account for all stock based awards based on the fair value method  it would have a material impact on our results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources at june   we had million in working capital and million in cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash  current investments and long term investments 
at june   we had in working capital  and in cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash  current investments and long term investments 
our cash and cash equivalents decreased by million from million as of june   to million as of june  the decrease in cash and cash equivalents was due to our investing and financing activities  which used million and million of cash and cash equivalents  respectively 
the cash and cash equivalents used by investing and financing activities were partially offset by our operating activities  which provided million of cash and cash equivalents 
in  investing activities  which primarily consisted of purchases of investments of million  maturities of investments of million and additions to property and equipment of million  used million of cash and cash equivalents 
in  investing activities  which primarily consisted of purchases of investments of million  maturities of investments of and additions to property and equipment of million  used million of cash and cash equivalents 
financing activities used million of cash and cash equivalents in this decrease in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to our repurchase of approximately million in face value of convertible subordinated notes at a discount to face value  spending million 
this decrease in cash and cash equivalents was partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock under stock option plans and proceeds from the issuance of common stock under the employee stock purchase plan 
in  financing activities  which consisted primarily of the net proceeds from the issuance of convertible subordinated notes of million as well as the repurchase of common stock and the proceeds from the issuance of common stock under stock option plans and the employee stock purchase plan  provided million of cash and cash equivalents 
operating activities provided million of cash and cash equivalents in  primarily from net income before non cash activities 
such non cash activities consisted primarily of the gain on repurchase of convertible subordinated notes  deferred income taxes  litigation settlements  depreciation and amortization of property and equipment  the amortization of other intangibles  deferred stock based compensation and the tax benefit from the exercise of stock options 
additional increases in cash and cash equivalents were due to a decrease in inventories and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets

qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk 
interest rate sensitivity at june   our investment portfolio consisted primarily of fixed income securities  excluding those classified as cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash  of million see note of the consolidated financial statements 
we have the positive intent and ability to hold these securities to maturity 
currently  the carrying amount of these securities approximates fair market value 
however  the fair market value of these securities is subject to interest rate risk and would decline in value if market interest rates increased 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by percent from the levels existing as of june   the decline in the fair value of the portfolio would not be material to our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
however  if interest rates decreased and securities within our portfolio matured and were re invested in securities with lower interest rates  interest income would decrease in the future 
our percent convertible subordinated notes are due february  foreign currency we have executed and will continue to execute transactions in foreign currencies 
as a result  we may be exposed to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency rates  particularly the british pound and the euro 
given the relatively small number of foreign currency transactions  we do not believe that its potential exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency rates is significant
