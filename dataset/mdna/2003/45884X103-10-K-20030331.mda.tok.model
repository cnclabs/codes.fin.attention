item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview intermune was incorporated in delaware on march  we are an independent biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing innovative products for the treatment of serious pulmonary  infectious and hepatic diseases 
we have three marketed products  growing product revenues and advanced stage clinical programs  addressing a range of diseases with attractive markets 
our three marketed products are actimmune  infergen and amphotec 
actimmune is approved in the united states for two rare congenital disorders chronic granulomatous disease and severe malignant osteopetrosis 
we market infergen in the united states and canada for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c infections 
we market amphotec worldwide for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis 
our total product revenues increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   an increase of since our inception  we have incurred significant losses and  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
our expenses have consisted primarily of those incurred for research and development  including the acquisition of product candidates under development  sales and marketing and general and administrative costs associated with our operations 
we expect that our expenditures for research and development expenses will increase as we continue clinical development of our products  and other expenses will increase as we expand our operations domestically and internationally 
as a result  we expect to incur losses through at least the end of we have a limited history of operations and our quarterly and annual results of operations may fluctuate due to several factors  including market acceptance of current or new products  the introduction of new products by our competitors  the timing and extent of our research and development efforts  and the timing of significant orders 
our limited operating history makes accurate prediction of future operating results difficult or impossible 
drug development in the united states is a process that includes several steps defined by the fda 
the process begins with the filing of an investigational new drug application or ind which  if successful  allows opportunity for clinical study of the potential new medicine 
clinical development typically accounts for an average of seven years of a drug s total development time to complete the three phases of clinical studies phase i  ii and iii 
the fda may require  or companies may pursue  additional clinical trials after a product is approved 
these so called phase iv studies may be made a condition to be satisfied after a drug receives approval 
the results of phase iv studies can confirm the effectiveness of a drug and can provide important safety information to augment the fda s voluntary adverse drug reaction reporting system 
the most significant costs associated with clinical development are phase iii trials as they tend to be the longest and largest studies conducted during the drug development process 
the successful development of our products is highly uncertain 
an estimation of product completion dates and completion costs can vary significantly for each product and are difficult to predict 
various statutes and regulations also govern or influence the manufacturing  safety  labeling  storage  record keeping and marketing of each product 
the lengthy process of seeking these approvals  and the subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations  require the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals could have a material adverse affect on our business 
in responding to a new drug application or nda  a biologic license application or bla or an nda or bla supplement the fda may grant marketing approval  request additional information or deny the application if it determines that the application does not provide an adequate basis for approval 
in  we reported data from our phase iii clinical trial of actimmune interferon gamma b injection for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ipf  a debilitating and usually fatal lung disease for which there are no therapies currently approved by the fda 
these data did not show actimmune to demonstrate statistically significant efficacy with respect to the primary or secondary endpoints of the phase iii clinical trial 
the analysis of survival  a secondary endpoint in this trial  suggested that although actimmune did not demonstrate a statistically significant increase in survival in the overall patient group  it may provide a survival benefit for patients with mild to moderate ipf 
generally  before granting a marketing approval of a drug for the treatment of a disease  the fda requires that the drug demonstrate safety and statistically significant efficacy with respect to the primary and or secondary endpoints of the clinical trial 
we therefore believe that the fda will require us to conduct an additional phase iii clinical trial of actimmune for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis prior to approving actimmune for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis 
in may  we acquired certain interferon gamma patents of amgen inc in exchange for million  of which million was paid in the second quarter of and the remaining million was an accrued liability at december  and was paid in january we expect to amortize these product rights to operations over the expected useful lives of the particular patent rights acquired for actimmune through the end of in march  we licensed from marnac  inc  a privately held biopharmaceutical company  and its co licensor  kdl gmbh  their worldwide rights  excluding japan  korea and taiwan  to develop and commercialize pirfenidone for all fibrotic diseases  including pulmonary  liver and renal fibrosis 
pirfenidone is not approved by the fda 
at the time of the product acquisition from marnac and kdl  pirfenidone was in phase ii clinical trials 
we will be required to file our own ind before commencing additional studies with pirfenidone 
under the terms of the agreement  we received an exclusive license from marnac and kdl in exchange for an up front cash payment of million and future milestone and royalty payments 
we expensed the million as acquired in process research and development in the first quarter of since pirfenidone is currently in clinical development  has not reached technical feasibility and has no foreseeable alternative future uses 
in october  we entered into an asset purchase and license agreement with eli lilly and company pursuant to which we acquired worldwide rights to oritavancin 
the agreement provides us with exclusive worldwide rights to develop  manufacture and commercialize oritavancin 
if we wish to enter into a relationship with a third party to commercialize oritavancin in any country  we must first offer eli lilly the opportunity to enter into such a commercialization relationship with us 
after we negotiate with eli lilly  the agreement prohibits us from entering into an agreement with a third party on more favorable terms than those we offered to eli lilly 
pursuant to the agreement  we paid eli lilly million in and will be obligated to pay eli lilly significant milestone and royalty payments upon any successful development and commercialization of oritavancin by us 
all of the million was expensed in as acquired in process research and development since oritavancin was in clinical development  has not reached technical feasibility and has no foreseeable alternative future uses 
in september  eli lilly exercised its option under the asset purchase and license agreement to reduce the agreed percentage of royalty payable by us to eli lilly upon successful commercialization of oritavancin 
the exercise of this option required us to pay million to eli lilly 
the total fee of million was recorded as a liability as of december   and was paid in january all of the million was expensed in the third quarter of as acquired in process research and development since oritavancin is currently in clinical development  has not reached technical feasibility and has no foreseeable alternative future uses 
our rights to oritavancin could revert to eli lilly if we do not meet our diligence obligations under the agreement or otherwise commit a material breach of the agreement 
additionally  if we are acquired by a company with a certain type of competing program and eli lilly has notified us prior to the acquisition that it believes in good faith that its economic interests in oritavancin under the agreement will be harmed in light of the acquisition  eli lilly may terminate the agreement and our rights to oritavancin would revert to eli lilly 
in any event  we may not assign the agreement to a potential acquirer without the advance  written consent of eli lilly 
in september  we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with maxygen holdings ltd  a wholly owned subsidiary of maxygen  inc  to develop and commercialize novel  next generation interferon gamma products that have enhanced pharmacokinetics and a potential for less frequent dosing regimens 
we plan to take forward into clinical development selected protein modified interferon gamma product candidates created by maxygen that meet these criteria 
we are funding optimization and development of these next generation interferon gamma products and retain exclusive worldwide commercialization rights for all human therapeutic indications 
the terms of the agreement include up front license fees  which were included in research and development expenses  full research funding and development and commercialization milestone payments 
in addition  maxygen will receive royalties on product sales 
our rights to the licensed products under the agreement could revert to maxygen if we do not meet our diligence obligations or otherwise commit a material breach of the agreement 
in june  we entered into a licensing and commercialization agreement with amgen  inc  to obtain an exclusive license in the united states and canada to infergen interferon alfacon  an interferon alpha product  and the rights to an early stage program to develop a pegylated form of infergen  peg infergen 
infergen is currently approved in both the united states and canada to treat chronic hepatitis c infections 
under the agreement  we have the exclusive right to market infergen and peg infergen and clinically develop them for other indications in the united states and canada 
we have paid amgen a total of million for up front license and other fees and performance milestones  and are obligated to pay royalties on sales of infergen 
based upon an independent appraisal  the fair value of the in process research and development program for peg infergen was million 
at the time of acquisition the peg infergen program had not reached technical feasibility 
the remainder of the purchase price of approximately million was allocated to developed technology is being be amortized over ten years 
we evaluate this intangible asset  like our other intangible assets  for impairment on a regular basis 
we are also required to pay amgen other milestone payments on the peg infergen program and royalties on sales of the product  if any 
our rights to infergen could revert to amgen if we do not meet our diligence obligations or otherwise commit a material breach of the agreement 
the value assigned to acquired in process research and technology was determined by estimating the costs to develop the purchased in process research and development into a commercially viable product  including development milestones  estimating the resulting net cash flows from the project and discounting the net cash flows to their present value 
a discount rate of was used for valuing the in process research and development and is intended to be commensurate with the our corporate maturity  the state of the potential product s development and the uncertainties in the economic estimates described above 
the technology under development has no foreseeable alternative future uses 
we use estimates in valuing in process research and development based upon assumptions we believe to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
our assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and no assurance can be given that unanticipated events and circumstances will not occur 
accordingly  actual results may vary from the projected results 
in may  we entered into a joint development and commercialization agreement for moli  a drug compound under development with molichem medicines  inc we paid an up front license fee of million in to molichem  which was charged to research and development expense in the parties jointly funded the development and commercialization of moli for all diseases worldwide  starting with cystic fibrosis 
molichem led the development efforts 
in december  upon appropriate notice  we terminated this agreement and we are not obligated to make further payments 
in march  we formed an international strategic collaboration with boehringer ingelheim international gmbh  to develop and commercialize interferon gamma b under boehringer ingelheim s trade name  imukin  in all countries outside of the united states  canada and japan 
indications to be developed include idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis  tuberculosis  non hodgkin s lymphoma  liver fibrosis  systemic fungal infections  chronic granulomatous disease  osteopetrosis and ovarian cancer 
under the agreement  we will fund and manage clinical and regulatory development of interferon gamma b for all indications 
boehringer ingelheim has an option to exclusively promote imukin  and we may opt to promote the product where boehringer ingelheim does not do so 
furthermore  both companies will share in the profits from commercializing interferon gamma b through a specified royalty schedule 
in january  we acquired worldwide rights from alza corporation to amphotec sold under the tradename amphocil in certain countries outside the united states 
the transaction terms included an up front product acquisition fee of million  which was recorded as an intangible asset  milestone payments based upon sales levels and specific achievements in the clinical development and regulatory approval of amphotec in combination with actimmune  and royalties payable upon net sales of amphotec 
we evaluate this intangible asset  like our other intangible assets  for impairment on a regular basis 
under the agreement  we obtained access to certain existing distributorships for amphotec  and assumed alza s obligations under agreements with its existing amphotec distributors and service providers 
we have diligence obligations under the agreement to establish additional distributorships for amphotec or establish a sales force and begin to promote amphotec in specified countries at specified times 
our rights to amphotec could revert to alza if we do not meet our diligence obligations or otherwise commit a material breach of the agreement 
we are also subject to certain royalty obligations to the university of california under this agreement 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses  and related disclosures 
on an on going basis  we evaluate these estimates  including those related to revenue recognition and related revenue reserves 
estimates are based on historical experience  information received from third parties and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition and revenue reserves revenue on product sales is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed and final  delivery has occurred and there is a reasonable assurance of collection of the sales proceeds 
we sell to a limited number of customers  mainly specialty pharmacies and distributors 
we obtain written purchase authorizations from our customers for a specified amount of product at a specified price and consider delivery to have occurred at the time of shipment 
revenue is recognized at shipment and reserves are recorded for estimated returns  rebates and chargebacks 
we are obligated to accept from customers the return of pharmaceuticals that have reached their expiration date 
we have demonstrated the ability to make reasonable and reliable estimates of product returns based on significant historical experience 
we review all sales transactions for potential rebates and chargebacks each month and monitor product ordering cycles and actual returns  product expiration dates and wholesale inventory levels to estimate potential product return rates 
we believe that our reserves are adequate 
accounting for intangible assets our intangible assets are comprised principally of acquired technology rights 
we apply judgments in determining the useful lives of our intangible assets and whether such assets are impaired 
factors we consider include the life of the underlying patent  the expected period of benefit from the use of the technology  existence of competing technology and potential obsolescence 
to date  we have not experienced any impairment of our intangible assets 
in accordance with us gaap  we perform tests for impairment of our intangible assets whenever events or circumstances suggest that these assets may be impaired 
to date  we have not experienced any impairment to our intangible assets 
to evaluate potential impairment  us gaap requires us to assess whether the future cash flows related to the asset will be greater than its carrying value at the time of the test 
accordingly  while our cash flow assumptions are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage our underlying businesses  there is significant judgment in determining the cash flows attributable to our intangible assets over their respective estimated useful lives 
if  however  we reduced the estimated useful life of all intangible assets by two years or assumed zero growth in revenues for the next three years  our intangible assets would still not be considered to be impaired and no write down would be required 
clinical trial accruals our accrued costs for clinical trial activities performed by contract research organizations are based upon estimates of the percentage of work completed over the life of the individual study 
these estimates may or may not match the actual services performed by the organization as determined by patient enrollment levels and related activities 
we monitor patient enrollment levels and related activities to the extent possible  however  if we underestimated activity levels associated with various studies at a given point in time  we could record significant research and development expenses in future periods 
all such costs are charged to r d expense as incurred 
deferred stock compensation in connection with the grant of stock options to employees  we recorded deferred stock compensation totaling million and million in the fiscal years ended december  and  respectively 
no such deferred stock compensation was recorded in the years and deferred stock compensation for options granted to employees has been determined as the difference between the fair value of our common stock for financial reporting purposes on the date such options were granted and the applicable exercise prices 
such amount is included as a reduction of stockholders equity and is being amortized using the graded vesting method over the vesting period of the individual options  which is generally five years 
this graded vesting method provides for accelerated vesting of portions of the overall award at interim dates and results in higher vesting in earlier years than straight line vesting 
during the year ended december   we reversed approximately million of amortization of deferred stock based compensation recorded in prior years due to the termination of certain employees 
we recorded amortization of deferred stock compensation of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
included in the million amortization for the year was approximately million recognized on the vesting acceleration of options for a terminated employee 
at december   we had a total of million to be amortized over the remaining vesting periods of the stock options 
the amount of deferred stock compensation expense to be recorded in future periods could decrease if options  for which accrued but unvested compensation has been recognized  are forfeited prior to vesting 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and revenue 
total product revenues were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the growth in product sales for the year was primarily due to a volume increase in sales of actimmune of million 
the product sales in included sales from actimmune  amphotec and infergen for the entire period 
product revenues in included all sales of actimmune in the united states  worldwide sales of amphotec for the period from january  the date we acquired the marketing rights to amphotec and sales of infergen in the united states for the period from june  the date we acquired the marketing rights to infergen 
the company projects total net product sales for to be in the range of million to million  with actimmune net product sales projected to be in the range of million to million for the year 
cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
cost of goods sold included manufacturing costs  royalties and distribution costs associated with our revenues 
the increase in cost of goods sold expense in was due entirely to costs associated with increased product sales volumes 
the gross margin percentage for our products were and for the periods in and  respectively 
the improved gross margin percentage in  when compared to the same period in  primarily reflects lower product costs of actimmune associated with the transfer of manufacturing to boehringer ingelheim at the end of amortization of acquired product rights 
we recorded amortization of acquired product rights of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the amount in was comprised of an amortization charge related to the acquisition of amphotec  infergen and interferon gamma patents 
the amount in was comprised of an amortization charge related to the acquisition of amphotec  infergen and purchased rights to all of the actimmune revenues and related expenses that we had previously transacted for connetics 
the amortization of the actimmune rights was expensed based upon product units shipped under the previous contractual unit baseline for the year this amounted to million for the period in these actimmune rights were fully amortized by the end of the second quarter of research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  representing an increase of or million 
the increased spending in was due primarily to increased costs for phase ii and phase iii clinical trial expenses for actimmune in new disease indications  clinical trial expenses and pre fda approval manufacturing qualification expenses for oritavancin  increased staffing and related expenses necessary to manage the expansion of our operations 
we expect that for the fiscal year  research and development expenses will be approximately million to million 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  representing an increase of or million 
the increased spending in was attributable primarily to increased staffing and related expenses necessary to manage the growth of our operations  expansion of our field sales force  re launch efforts for infergen and the expansion into our new company headquarters in brisbane  california 
we believe that selling  general and administrative expenses will increase as a result of the anticipated expansion of our administrative staff and increased marketing and selling expenses for our approved products  and the expenses associated with the expansion of our operations 
we expect for the fiscal year  selling  general and administrative expenses will be approximately million to million 
acquired in process research and development 
we recorded charges for acquired in process research and development of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
during  we recorded a charge for acquired in process research and development of million related to the exercise of an option by eli lilly under the asset purchase and license agreement entered into october  to reduce the agreed percentage of royalty payable by us to eli lilly upon successful commercialization of oritavancin 
oritavancin is not currently approved by the fda 
we expensed the million in as acquired in process research and development cost as oritavancin is currently in clinical development  has not reached technical feasibility and has no foreseeable alternative future uses 
at december   the million was recorded as an accrued liability and was paid in january also in  we recorded a one time charge of million related to the payment to marnac  inc for our march license of its worldwide rights  excluding japan  korea and taiwan  to develop and commercialize pirfenidone for all fibrotic diseases  including renal  liver and pulmonary fibrosis 
pirfenidone is not currently approved by the fda 
we expensed the million as acquired in process research and development cost as pirfenidone is currently in clinical development  has not reached technical feasibility and has no foreseeable alternative future uses 
for the year ended december   we licensed worldwide rights to oritavancin from eli lilly and company 
we paid an up front fee of million to eli lilly and an additional million in related expenses 
we recorded the total of million as acquired in process research and development 
we expensed the million as acquired in process research and development cost as oritavancin is currently in clinical development  has not reached technical feasibility and has no foreseeable alternative future uses 
we will also pay eli lilly significant milestone and royalty payments upon successful development and commercialization 
oritavancin is not currently approved by the fda and is in phase ii and phase iii clinical trials for various indications 
we expect to commercialize oritavancin no earlier than also in  we entered into a licensing and commercialization agreement with amgen inc and obtained an exclusive license in the united states and canada to infergen a therapeutic approved by the fda for the treatment of hepatitis c infections and the rights to an early stage program to develop a pegylated form of infergen peg infergen for a total consideration of million  plus development milestones and royalties 
under the agreement  we also have the exclusive right to clinically develop infergen and peg infergen for other indications in the united states and canada 
we do not expect the peg infergen program  which is currently in its early stages approximately completed  to reach the fda approval stage prior to at the earliest  if at all 
based upon an independent appraisal  the fair value of the in process research and development program for peg infergen was determined to be million 
we expensed this amount as acquired in process research and development as peg infergen is currently in clinical development  has not reached technical feasibility and has no foreseeable alternative future uses 
the remainder of the purchase price of approximately million was for infergen and was allocated to developed technology and is being amortized over ten years 
we evaluate this asset  like our other intangible assets  for impairment on a regular basis 
the value we assigned to acquired in process research and development for the peg infergen program was determined by estimating the costs to develop amgen s purchased in process research and development into a commercially viable product including development milestones  estimating the resulting net cash flows from the project  and discounting the net cash flows to their present value 
we assigned a discount rate of for valuing the in process research and development  which is intended to be commensurate with our corporate maturity and the uncertainties in the economic estimates described above 
the technology under development has no foreseeable alternative future uses 
the estimates used by us in valuing in process research and development were based upon assumptions we believe to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
our assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and no assurance can be given that unanticipated events and circumstances will not occur 
accordingly  actual results may vary from the projected results 
interest income 
interest income totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in interest income in was due to substantially lower market interest rates offset by an increase of average cash available as a result of the completion of a million equity financing during the year 
interest expense 
interest expense totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in was attributable to a full year of interest expense on million aggregate principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes issued in july  which mature in july provision for income taxes 
due to operating losses and the uncertainty of recognizing the benefits therefrom  there was no provision for income taxes for the years ended december  and as of december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million 
the net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in through if not utilized 
we also have federal research and development tax credits of approximately million that will expire in the years through in addition  we had net operating loss carryforwards for state income tax purposes of approximately million  that expire in the years through  and state research and development tax credits of approximately million that do not expire 
utilization of the net operating losses may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the change in ownership provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended  and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses before utilization 
comparison of years ended december  and revenue 
total product revenues were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the growth in product sales for the year was primarily attributable to a million increase in sales of actimmune 
the product revenues in included all sales of actimmune in the united states  worldwide sales of amphotec for the period from january  the date we acquired the marketing rights to amphotec and sales of infergen in the united states for the period from june  the date we acquired the marketing rights to infergen 
the product revenues in included sales of actimmune outside the united states related to a supply arrangement and for the period from april  to december  in the united states 
on june   we terminated an agreement with connetics for actimmune sales below a contractual baseline 
for the three month period ended march   sales transacted for connetics below the annual contractual baseline were recorded on a net basis  which was zero  and any amounts in excess of net revenues less costs to produce and market were paid to connetics 
cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
cost of goods sold included manufacturing costs  royalties and distribution costs associated with our revenues 
the increase in was due entirely to costs associated with increased product sales volumes 
the gross margin percentage for our products were and for the periods in and  respectively 
the improved gross margin percentage in  when compared to the same period in  reflects a lower effective royalty percentage payable for actimmune and partially offset by product mix associated with the addition of amphotec in amortization of acquired product rights 
we recorded amortization of acquired product rights of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
on june   we purchased rights to all of the actimmune revenues and related expenses that we had previously transacted for connetics 
the amortization of those rights was completed in and expensed based upon product units shipped under the previous contractual unit baseline for the year in addition  we recognized a total of million in for the amortization of product rights acquired in research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  representing an increase of or million 
of the increased costs in the year  a total of million was related to non cash stock based compensation and the amortization of deferred stock compensation and a total of million was incurred for external collaboration support for next generation interferon gamma products  technology licenses and an investment in a privately held development stage company 
the remaining increase in was due primarily to increased costs for clinical trial expenses for actimmune in new and existing disease indications and internal support personnel 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  representing an increase of or million 
of the increased costs in  a total of million was related to non cash stock based compensation and the amortization of deferred stock compensation 
the remaining increase in was attributable primarily to increased staffing and related expenses necessary to manage the growth of our operations  expansion of our field sales force and the expansion into our new company headquarters 
in december  we added additional field personnel to support our products 
acquired in process research and development 
as described above  we recorded charges for acquired in process research and development totaling million for the year ended december  related to the acquisition of infergen and oritavancin no charges in 
interest income 
interest income totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in interest income in was due to increased cash available for investments as a result of the completion of million in debt financing and million in an equity financing during the year  offset by lower interest rates 
interest expense 
interest expense totaled million and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in was attributable to interest expense on million aggregate principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes issued during the year 
the amount in related to imputed interest on the obligations to connetics that were paid in full on march deemed dividend upon issuance of redeemable convertible preferred stock 
we recorded a deemed dividend of million in january  upon the issuance of  shares of series b redeemable convertible preferred stock 
at the dates of issuance  we believed the per share price of represented the fair value of the preferred stock and was in excess of the deemed fair value of our common stock 
subsequent to the commencement of our initial public offering process  we re evaluated the deemed fair value of our common stock and determined it to be to per share 
accordingly  the aggregate proceeds of million were deemed to be the equivalent of a preferred stock dividend 
we recorded the deemed dividend at the date of issuance by offsetting charges and credits to additional paid in capital of million  without any effect on total stockholders equity 
the amount increased the loss applicable to common stockholders in the calculation of basic net loss per share the year ended december  provision for income taxes 
due to operating losses and the uncertainty of recognizing the benefits therefrom  there was no provision for income taxes for the years ended december  and liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have funded our operations through issuances of equity and debt securities and sales of our products 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and available for sale investments of million 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximize yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest our excess cash in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies and high quality corporate issuers  and  by policy  restrict our exposure to any single corporate issuer by imposing concentration limits 
to minimize the exposure due to adverse shifts in interest rates  we maintain investments at an average maturity of generally less than eighteen months 
net cash used in operations for the year ended december  totaled million  compared to million in and million in a net loss of million for the year ended december  included non cash charges of million for the amortization of deferred stock compensation  million related to non cash stock compensation  and million for depreciation and amortization 
in addition  net cash used in operations for the year ended december  was further impacted by acquired in process research and development expenditures of million  an increase in accounts receivable of million resulting from increased product sales and an increase in product inventories of million 
these uses of operating cash were offset by an increase of million in accounts payable and accrued compensation resulting from increases in operating expense levels and commission and vacation liabilities from additional personnel added during the year and an increase of million in other accrued liabilities 
net cash used for investing activities in the year ended december   was million  compared to million in and million used in in  the net cash used for investing activities was primarily due to the purchases of short term available for sale investments  offset by sales and maturities of short term available for sale investments and payments for acquisition of product rights 
in  the net cash used for investing activities was primarily due to the net purchases of short term available for sale investments and cash used for the acquisition of product rights 
in  the net cash used for investing activities was primarily due to the net purchases of short term available for sale investments 
capital expenditures for equipment and leasehold improvements to support our operations were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  totaled million  compared to million in and million in in  net cash provided by financing activities included million received in net proceeds from the sale of million shares of common stock at per share prior to deducting underwriters fees and expenses in a follow on public offering  million from stock option exercises and million received under our employee stock purchase plan 
in  net cash provided by financing activities included million in net proceeds from the sale of common stock in a follow on public offering  million received from the sale of convertible subordinated notes  million from stock option exercises and million received under our employee stock purchase plan 
in  net cash provided by financing activities included million in net proceeds from the sale of series b convertible preferred stock to investors in january  million in net proceeds from the sale of common stock in our initial public offering  million in net proceeds from a private placement of common stock which closed on august   million from stock option exercises and million received under our employee stock purchase plan offset by million paid to connetics upon the close of our initial public offering 
we recorded this payment as a return of capital to parent 
the timing of and amounts realized from stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan purchases are determined by the decisions of the respective option or right holders  and are not controlled by us 
therefore  funds raised from exercises of stock options or employee stock purchase plan purchases in the past periods should not be considered an indication of additional funds to be raised in future periods 
working capital of million at december  decreased from million at december  the decrease in working capital for the period in was primarily due to funding our operating loss 
in december  we filed a registration statement on form s to offer and sell our common stock in one or more offerings up to a total dollar amount of million 
currently  million remains available on the form s we have no current commitments to offer or sell any securities that may be offered or sold pursuant to such registration statement 
we do not have any special purpose entities that are unconsolidated in our financial statements 
we have no commercial commitments or loans with related parties  except for ongoing payments to mr 
simon  a former director of our board of directors who resigned in february  in connection with the oritavancin acquisition from eli lilly  and an executive employee loan to dr 
armstrong that was in place prior to the enactment of the sarbanes oxley act of we believe that we will continue to require substantial additional funding in order to complete the research and development activities currently contemplated and to commercialize our proposed products 
we believe our existing cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities  together with anticipated cash flows from our operations  will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses  debt obligations and capital requirements through at least the end of however  this forward looking statement is based upon our current plans and assumptions  which may change  and our capital requirements may increase in future periods 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including  but not limited to the commercial performance of any of our products or product candidates in development that receive commercial approval  our ability to partner our development and commercialization programs  the progress of our research and development efforts  the scope and results of pre clinical studies and trials  the costs  timing and outcome of regulatory reviews  determinations as to the commercial potential of our products in development  the pace of expansion of administrative expenses  the status of competitive products  the establishment of manufacturing capacity through third party manufacturing agreements  the pace of expansion of our sales and marketing capabilities  in preparation for product launches  our possible geographic expansion  the establishment of collaborative relationships with other companies  the payments of the annual interest on our convertible subordinated debt  and whether in we must repay the principal in connection with our convertible subordinated debt 
as a result  we may require additional funds and may attempt to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings  collaborative arrangements with corporate partners or from other sources 
we have no commitments for such fund raising activities 
additional funding may not be available to finance our operations when needed or  if available  the terms for obtaining such funds may not be favorable or may result in dilution to our stockholders 
contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties  and exclude contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payments

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we maintain an investment portfolio of depository accounts  master notes and liquidity optimized investment contracts 
the securities in our investment portfolio are not leveraged  are classified as available for sale and are  due to their short term nature  subject to minimal interest rate risk 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure 
because of the short term maturities of our investments  we do not believe that a change in market rates would have a significant negative impact on the value of our investment portfolio 
at december   the average maturity of our available for sale securities was days 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest our excess cash in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies and high quality corporate issuers  and  by policy  restrict our exposure to any single corporate issuer by imposing concentration limits 
to minimize the exposure due to adverse shifts in interest rates we maintain investments of shorter maturities 
the table below presents the principal amounts and weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio in millions total fair value at december  assets available for sale securities average interest rate liabilities convertible subordinated notes due average interest rate we have some obligations in foreign currencies  principally the purchase of actimmune inventory  which is denominated in euros 
we do not currently use derivative financial instruments to mitigate this exposure
