the following discussion  other than historical facts  contains forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
the company s results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including factors described elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview the consolidated financial statements present the financial condition of the company as of june  and  and the consolidated results of operations and cash flows of the company for the years ended june   and on december   at a special meeting of shareholders  the company s shareholders approved the creation of a holding company structure in which the company s operating assets would be transferred to a newly formed  wholly owned  subsidiary and authorized an amendment to the company s certificate of incorporation to change the name of the company from anaren microwave  inc to anaren  inc the name change to anaren  inc 
became effective on december  and the company s operating assets were transferred to a wholly owned subsidiary named anaren microwave  inc effective december  the company designs  develops and markets microwave components and assemblies for the wireless communications  satellite communications and defense electronics markets 
the company s distinctive manufacturing and packaging techniques enable it to cost effectively produce compact  lightweight microwave products for use in base stations for wireless communications systems  in satellites and in defense electronics systems 
the company sells its products to leading wireless communications equipment manufacturers such as ericsson  lucent technologies  motorola  nokia  nortel networks  and powerwave and to satellite communications and defense electronics companies such as boeing satellite  itt  lockheed martin  northrup grumman and raytheon 
the company generally recognizes sales at the time products are shipped to customers  provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the sales price is fixed or easily determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured and title and risk of loss have passed to the customer 
title and the risks and rewards of ownership of products are generally transferred at the time of shipment 
payments received from customers in advance of products delivered are recorded as customer advance payments until earned 
annually  a small percentage of sales are derived from long term fixed price contracts for the sale of large space and defense electronics products 
sales and estimated profits under long term contracts are recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting on a units of delivery basis 
profit estimates are revised periodically based upon changes in sales value and costs at completion 
any losses on these contracts are recognized in the period in which such losses are determined 
in the first quarter of calendar  the company created a new subsidiary  anaren communication suzhou company  ltd 
and signed a three year lease for a  square foot manufacturing facility in suzhou industrial park in suzhou  china 
a general manager and operating staff were hired from july through september and light manufacturing and assembly was begun at the facility in the second quarter of fiscal in february  the suzhou subsidiary exercised its option to lease the  square foot second floor of this facility to support anticipated additional business needs in china 
presently  the facility has a staff of workers and expects to ramp up to over people in the first half of fiscal to support production for a custom wireless program for a european customer 
it is anticipated that this facility will serve all of the company s asian customers 
additionally  it is expected that this location will be used to facilitate procurement of raw materials in china  when possible  for the company s other subsidiaries 
in september  as a result of the loss of customers due to the july fire and the general decline in the wireless market  the company made a decision to downsize the anaren europe workforce 
twenty four people were let go at that time and a restructuring charge of  was recorded in the first quarter 
large operating losses and negative cash flow continued at anaren europe in the second and third quarters due to the continued weakness in the printed circuit board segment of the wireless infrastructure market and it was determined at the end of the third quarter to significantly downsize this operation again 
in april  in conjunction with this reorganization and due to continued negative cash flow projections after the restructuring  the company performed a fasb evaluation to determine if the fixed assets used by anaren europe were subject to an impairment loss 
based on the results of the evaluation  an impairment loss of  was identified and was recorded as a charge in the income statements under the caption impairment loss for the third quarter of fiscal staff at anaren europe was reduced again by people and an additional restructuring charge of  for severance and outplacement costs was recognized in april 
operating losses and decreasing sales levels continued throughout april and may and by the end of may the company decided to dispose of the anaren europe operation as the recovery in sales levels required to make the facility profitable was not likely to happen in the near future 
in conjunction with the decision to dispose of anaren europe  the company recorded an additional asset impairment charge of million to adjust fixed asset balances at that facility to liquidation value and a restructuring charge of  to record severance for the remaining employees and  to record inventory write downs included in cost of sales restructuring 
in march  as a result of the continuing low level of business at the company s rf power subsidiary  the decision was made to downsize the workforce at that facility 
sixteen people were subsequently terminated at a cost of  which has been recognized as a restructuring charge in the income statements 
in april  based on the continued weak wireless market conditions and the current financial performance of the company  the company s anaren microwave  inc subsidiary reduced its workforce by people 
in conjunction with this action  the company recorded a restructuring charge of  in the fourth quarter of fiscal on september   the company submitted an acquisition proposal to celeritek  inc s chairman  president and chief executive officer  which stated that the company was prepared to offer per share in an all cash transaction to acquire all of the outstanding shares of celeritek  subject to successful completion of customary due diligence and negotiation and execution of a definitive acquisition agreement 
on september   celeritek issued a press release announcing that its board had rejected the company s proposal claiming that the proposal is not in the best interests of celeritek shareholders 
in june  the company executed a non disclosure agreement with celeritek 
on july and   the company s management met with celeritek s chairman  tamer husseini  and other members of celeritek s senior management to begin to conduct a due diligence review of celeritek s business 
anaren intends to continue to consider all of the alternatives available to it  and may pursue one or more of the possible actions outlined in its schedule d  as amended 
the company s original investment in celeritek common stock averaged approximately a share and totaled million 
during the year ended june   the market value of celeritek common stock has fluctuated substantially  and the stock has at times traded above the cost of the company s investment 
this investment had a market value at june  of approximately million  a decline of  which has been recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss 
the company considers this to be a temporary decline in market value 
if  at a future date  this drop in market value is determined to be other than temporary  then the decline in value  including the amount previously charged as other comprehensive loss to shareholders equity  would at that time be recognized as a loss in the current period income statement 
for the fiscal year ended june   net sales were million and the net loss was million  or per diluted share  compared to net sales of million and net income of million  or per diluted share  for fiscal excluding the results of anaren europe  net sales for the fiscal year were million and net income was million  or per diluted share

net sales increased million  or  to million for fiscal  compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
this increase consisted of a million rise in wireless sales and a million increase in sales of space and defense products 
the million increase in fiscal wireless sales  which consist of standard surface mount components and custom subassemblies for use in building wireless base station equipment  resulted from a combination of new acquisitions during fiscal and increased customer demand 
wireless sales for fiscal include a full twelve months of sales for amitron and anaren europe  while sales for fiscal included only nine months and ten months of sales for anaren europe and amitron  respectively 
these acquisitions resulted in additional sales in fiscal of million compared to fiscal sales levels 
additionally  customer wireless infrastructure demand rose slightly in the first and second quarters  coming mainly from asian infrastructure build outs 
space and defense products consist of custom components and assemblies for communication satellites and defense radar and countermeasure subsystems for the military 
sales in the space and defense group rose million  or  in fiscal  compared to the prior fiscal year 
this increase in shipments resulted from production sales under a number of defense contracts for digital frequency discriminators dfds and digital rf memories drfms for foreign applications  radar antenna feed networks  and precision ranging subsystems prss for us government applications 
these products contributed to the rise in defense orders in the company s backlog during the last fiscal year 
space and defense sales are expected to be between and million  quarterly  in fiscal gross profit 
cost of sales consists primarily of engineering design costs  materials  material fabrication costs  assembly costs  direct and indirect overhead  and test costs 
gross profit for fiscal was million of net sales  down million from million of net sales for the same quarter of the prior year 
the drop in gross margin as a percentage of net sales in fiscal is a result of the continuing negative margins at anaren europe resulting from declining sales at that facility  and to continuing pricing pressure from wireless customers  which has resulted in lower average sales prices year over year 
additionally  cost of sales includes a  restructuring charge for inventory writedowns related to the disposition of anaren europe 
the company is continuing its cost cutting programs and has reduced its personnel levels through restructuring and attrition by approximately people  or over during the past fiscal year 
additionally  in june  the company decided to close the anaren europe facility and  where possible  low margin products have been eliminated from the company line up 
the company anticipates that these ongoing cost cutting efforts should help to improve future gross margins in fiscal  but any significant improvement in gross margins will most likely occur only with a rise in sales volume 
marketing 
marketing expenses consist mainly of employee related expenses  commissions paid to sales representatives  trade show expenses  advertising expenses and related travel expenses 
marketing expenses decreased to million of net sales for fiscal from million of net sales for fiscal marketing expense declined in fiscal due to a budgeted decline in advertising expenditures in the current fiscal year compared to fiscal and the reassignment of some marketing personnel to other company functions 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist of material and salaries and related overhead costs of employees engaged in ongoing research  design and development activities associated with new products and technology development 
research and development expenses were million of net sales in fiscal  down  from million of net sales for fiscal research and development expenditures are supporting further development of wireless infrastructure products and new wireless networking product opportunities 
despite the continuing wireless market downturn  the company does not expect to significantly reduce its current research and development efforts in the near term and is presently working on the development of a number of new standard surface mount wireless products 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist of employee related expenses  professional services  and intangible amortization  travel related expenses and other corporate costs 
general and administrative expenses increased to million of net sales for fiscal from million of net sales for fiscal this increase was due to professional services costs associated with the celeritek offer  costs incurred at the new china facility  and a full twelve months of general and administrative expenditures for amitron and anaren europe compared to ten and nine months  respectively  last year 
impairment loss 
in conjunction with the reorganization of anaren europe in april  the company performed a fasb evaluation to determine if the fixed assets used by anaren europe were subject to an impairment loss  due to continuing negative cash flow in that operation 
a fasb impairment loss of  was identified  which was recorded as a charge in the income statements under the caption impairment loss in the quarter ended march  in june due to further deterioration in the business conditions at anaren europe  the company decided to dispose of that facility and liquidate its assets 
as part of the liquidation process  an auction firm was contracted to appraise and sell these assets at auction when production ceases at the facility 
due to the pending closure  an additional fasb evaluation was conducted which resulted in an additional write down of  to estimated fair value  which was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal the company anticipates that this operation will be liquidated by december restructuring 
restructuring expense consists of severance pay  outplacement costs  extended benefit costs and other expenses incurred in reducing the company s workforce 
in september  april and june  the company incurred restructuring charges related to reductions in workforce and the anticipated closing of its anaren europe facility located in the netherlands 
the restructuring charges amounted to  in september   and  in april and june and included severance pay  outplacement costs  extended benefits costs and write offs of excess inventory  included in cost of sales  related to the closing of anaren europe and the termination of all of its employees 
in march  the company recorded a restructuring charge of  related to the company s restructuring plan at its rf power subsidiary 
this plan was primarily aimed at reducing the cost of excess personnel in this operation and included the termination of employees 
in june  the company also incurred a restructuring charge of  related to the company s restructuring plan to reduce overhead at its anaren microwave  inc subsidiary 
this plan was aimed at reducing the excess cost of indirect personnel at this operation and included individuals 
all restructuring costs are expected to be paid in full within twelve months 
operating income the operating loss increased million in fiscal to a loss of million of sales  from a loss of  of net sales  for fiscal on a reporting segment basis  the wireless operating loss was million for  an increase of million from the wireless operating loss of million in fiscal the principal reason for the increase in the wireless operating loss in the current year was the decline in wireless sales year over year  the million restructuring charge and the million impairment loss recorded in connection with the announced closing of anaren europe 
wireless operating results are expected to improve in fiscal as a result of the fiscal reorganizations and the resulting personnel reductions 
space and defense operating income fell million in fiscal to million compared to million in fiscal this decrease resulted from a change in product mix during the current year compared to last year 
this year s sales included more military programs  while sales in last year consisted of more profitable commercial space programs 
other income 
other income is primarily interest income received on invested cash balances 
other income decreased to million of net sales for the year ended june   from million of net sales for last year 
this decrease was caused mainly by the decline in market interest rates over the last months brought about by reductions in the federal fund rates 
interest income will fluctuate based on the level of interest rates and the level of investable cash balances 
interest expense interest expense represents commitment fees and interest paid on a deferred obligation 
interest expense for fiscal was  of net sales compared to  of net sales for fiscal this decrease was the result of the intentional cancellation of the company s line of credit and pay off of some minor anaren europe loan balances 
income taxes income taxes for fiscal were  of net sales  representing an effective tax rate of 
this compares to income tax benefit of  of net sales for fiscal  representing an effective tax benefit rate of 
the company s effective tax rate is a direct result of the proportion of federally exempt state municipal bond income and federal tax credits and benefits in relation to the levels of taxable income or loss and the losses from anaren europe that have not generated current tax benefits 
in fiscal  the company finalized an analysis of certain available research credits and export tax benefits and recorded a tax benefit of  year ended june  compared to year ended june  net sales 
net sales decreased million  or  to million for the year ended june  compared to million for the previous year 
this decrease was caused by a drop in wireless sales  which was partially offset by a rise in sales of space and defense products 
the million decrease in sales of wireless products  was caused by a rapid downturn in capital expenditures for wireless infrastructure equipment which began in the latter part of fiscal this downturn resulted in numerous reductions in customer demand forecasts and delivery push outs beginning in march and continuing through fiscal this market downturn has affected all of the company s wireless product lines and most severely affected sales of wireless standard components 
the downturn in wireless market sales was somewhat offset by the inclusion of million in sales in fiscal from anaren europe and amitron  the company s fiscal acquisitions 
sales in the space and defense group rose million  or  in fiscal  compared to the prior fiscal year 
this increase in shipments resulted from factory production shipments for the boeing spaceway program 
gross profit 
gross profit for fiscal was million of net sales  down from million of net sales for the prior year 
the decrease in gross margin resulted from the decline in sales volume  which caused under absorption of factory overhead compared to the previous year 
marketing 
marketing expenses increased to million of net sales for fiscal from million of net sales for fiscal marketing expenses increased due to the addition of new east and west coast marketing offices and the additional marketing expenses associated with the company s acquired businesses  amitron and anaren europe  which amounted to approximately million in fiscal research and development 
research and development expenses increased to million of net sales in fiscal from million of net sales for fiscal research and development expenditures are supporting further development of wireless infrastructure products and new wireless networking product opportunities with a renewed emphasis on developing new standard surface mount wireless products 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million of net sales for fiscal from million of net sales for fiscal general and administrative expenses have decreased primarily due to the adoption of fasb statement no 
which eliminated the amortization of goodwill starting in the first quarter of fiscal the elimination of goodwill reduced general and administrative expenses by million in the current year compared to last year 
this elimination of goodwill amortization was partially offset by an increase in identifiable intangible amortization of  in fiscal associated with the company s acquisition of amitron 
additionally  general and administrative expense for fiscal includes ten months and nine of expense for amitron and anaren europe  respectively  which amounted to approximately million in the aggregate 
operating income 
operating income decreased million to an operating loss of  of net sales for fiscal  from an operating profit of million of net sales for fiscal on a reporting segment basis  the wireless operating loss was million for fiscal  down or million from million operating income in fiscal the principal reason for the decrease in wireless operating income in fiscal compared to fiscal was the decrease in wireless sales year over year due to the large decrease in wireless base station equipment demand worldwide 
the large decline in sales levels in the wireless segment resulted in significant under absorption of fixed overhead within the group during the current fiscal year 
additionally  operating income in the wireless sector was further decreased by the million operating loss at anaren europe in fiscal due to the fire recovery costs and the low level of sales caused by the fire 
space and defense operating income rose million  or  for fiscal compared to fiscal this increase resulted from a million rise in space and defense revenues year over year  due to the spaceway program entering full production at the end of fiscal year this increase in revenue resulted in better absorption of fixed overhead in fiscal compared to the previous year 
additionally  cost reduction and efficiency efforts in this segment were successful in reducing the overall cost of operations in fiscal compared to the prior year 
other income 
other income decreased to million of net sales for the year ended june  from million of net sales for the prior year 
this decrease was caused mainly by the decline in market interest rates over the preceeding months brought about by reductions in the federal fund rates  and the use of approximately million in cash to complete the acquisitions of amitron and anaren europe 
interest income will fluctuate based on the level of interest rates and the level of investible cash balances 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recorded an other income item amounting to approximately  representing the remaining principal balance on a capitalized lease obligation which was no longer payable by the company 
the equipment leased by the company was destroyed in the july fire 
interest expense interest expense for fiscal was  of net sales compared to  of net sales for fiscal income taxes 
the tax benefit for fiscal was  of net sales 
this compared to tax expense of million of net sales for fiscal  representing an effective tax rate of 
during fiscal  the company finalized an analysis of certain available research credits and export tax benefits and recorded a tax benefit of  in addition  the company s effective tax rate decreased as a direct result of the increased proportion of federally exempt state municipal bond income in relation to income before taxes 
extraordinary gain 
the extraordinary gain in fiscal of million of net sales resulted from the purchase of anaren europe 
as a result of the fire and the subsequent insurance settlement  the value of the anaren europe assets at the time of purchase was significantly higher than the consideration paid by anaren 
this situation resulted in significant negative goodwill being generated by the transaction  which  under current accounting convention  was first offset by writing down the acquired fixed assets to zero and then by recognizing an extraordinary gain of  or per share  in the second quarter of fiscal critical accounting policies the methods  estimates and judgments management uses in applying the company s most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results reported in the company s financial statements 
the us securities and exchange commission has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of anaren s financial condition and results  and that require management to make the most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on this definition  the company s most critical policies include valuation of accounts receivable  which impacts general and administrative expense  valuation of inventory  which impacts cost of sales and gross margin  the assessment of recoverability of goodwill and other intangible and long lived assets  which impacts write offs of goodwill  intangibles and long lived assets  and accounting for income taxes  which impacts the valuation allowance and the effective tax rate 
management reviews the estimates  including  but not limited to  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory reserves and income tax valuations on a regular basis and makes adjustments based on historical experiences  current conditions and future expectations 
the reviews are performed regularly and adjustments are made as required by current available information 
the company believes these estimates are reasonable  but actual results could differ from these estimates 
the company s accounts receivable represent those amounts which have been billed to its customers but not yet collected 
the company analyzes various factors including historical experience  credit worthiness of customers and current market and economic conditions 
the allowance for doubtful accounts balance is established based on the portion of those accounts receivable which are deemed to be potentially uncollectible 
changes in judgments on these factors could impact the timing of costs recognized 
the company states inventories at the lower of cost or market  using a standard cost methodology to determine the cost basis for the inventory 
this method approximates actual cost on a first in first out basis 
the recoverability of inventories is based on the types and levels of inventory held  forecasted demand  pricing  competition and changes in technology 
the company records valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion of the amount may not be realized 
the company evaluates the need for valuation allowances on a regular basis and adjusts the allowance as needed 
these adjustments  when made  would have an impact on the company s financial statements in the period that they were recorded 
intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized to their residual values over those estimated useful lives in proportion to the economic benefit consumed 
long lived assets with estimated useful lives are depreciated to their residual values over those useful lives in proportion to the economic value consumed 
long lived assets are tested for impairment at the group level  which is usually an economic unit such as a manufacturing facility or department  which has a measurable economic output or product 
long lived assets are tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long lived asset may not be recoverable and exceeds its fair market value 
this circumstance exists if the carrying amount of the assets in question exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset 
the impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long lived asset exceeds its fair value as determined by the discounted cash flow or in the case of negative cash flow  an independent market appraisal of the asset 
goodwill is tested annually  or sooner if indicators of impairment exist  for impairment by the company at the reporting unit level by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value 
valuation methods for determining the fair value of the reporting unit include reviewing quoted market prices and discounted cash flows 
if the goodwill is indicated as being impaired the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount  the fair value of the reporting unit is then allocated to its assets and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
this implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is then compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill and  if it is less  the company would then recognize an impairment loss 
the projection of future cash flows for the goodwill impairment analysis requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the assets and the future cash outlays related to those revenues 
actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in changes in this assessment and result in an impairment charge 
the use of different assumptions could increase or decrease the related impairment charge 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operations for the years ended june  and were million and million  respectively 
the positive cash flow from operations in fiscal was due primarily to the million reduction in accounts receivable and the million reduction in inventory during the period 
the positive cash flow from operations in fiscal was due mainly to the high income level and the large amount of cash million received from the anaren europe insurance settlement 
net cash used in investing activities in fiscal and consists mainly of funds used to purchase capital equipment  net purchases and maturities of marketable securities and  in fiscal  million used to purchase the capital stock of amitron and anaren europe 
capital equipment placed in service amounted to million in fiscal compared to million in the previous fiscal year  including million at anaren europe due to the july fire 
net cash used in financing activities in fiscal was million 
of this amount   was generated by the exercise of stock options and million was used to repurchase  shares of the company s common stock under an existing repurchase plan previously authorized by the board of directors 
net cash used in financing activities was million for fiscal and consisted of million used to pay off loans of amitron and anaren europe  reduced by  generated from the exercise of stock options 
at june   the company had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities  and no debt and has had positive operating cash flow for over eight years 
for the past six years the company has maintained a guaranteed revolving line of credit facility under which it has never borrowed any funds 
effective october   the company cancelled this line to eliminate the then current annual fee of approximately  the company believes that its cash requirements for the foreseeable future will be satisfied by currently invested cash balances and expected cash flows from operations

in march  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on eitf revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
this issue addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which it will perform multiple revenue generating activities 
specifically  this issue addresses how to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting 
in applying this issue  separate contracts with the same entity or related parties that are entered into at or near the same time are presumed to have been negotiated as a package and should  therefore  be evaluated as a single arrangement in considering whether there are one or more units of accounting 
that presumption may be overcome if there is sufficient evidence to the contrary 
this issue also addresses how arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate units of accounting in the arrangement 
the guidance in this issue is effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  the company has reviewed the provisions of eitf  and believes that upon adoption  the issue will not have a significant effect on its financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discusses the company s possible exposure to market risk related to changes in interest rates  equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including factors described elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
as of june   the company had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million  of which approximately million consisted of highly liquid investments in marketable debt securities and million consisted of marketable equity securities 
the marketable debt securities at date of purchase normally have maturities between one and months  are exposed to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
a hypothetical decrease in market interest rate of from june  rates  or  would have reduced net income and cash flow by approximately  or per share for the year 
due to the relatively short maturities of the securities and its ability to hold those investments to maturity  the company does not believe that an immediate decrease in interest rates would have a significant effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
over time  however  declines in interest rates will reduce the company s interest income 
the company currently owns equity investments held for sale with a market value of approximately million 
fluctuations in market value of these securities are charged to stockholders equity monthly 
a theoretical decline in market value of these securities would result in a  reduction in stockholders equity 
in the future  if the decline in value of these securities is considered other than temporary  then the full decline in value experienced to the date of impairment will be reflected in the then current period income statement 
all of the company s sales from its domestic us subsidiaries to foreign customers are denominated in united states dollars and  accordingly  are not exposed to foreign currency exchange risk 
sales of the company s netherlands subsidiary  anaren europe  are denominated in euros to european customers and united states dollars to us customers 
sales to us customers by anaren europe denominated in united states dollars would be subject to currency exchange losses 
at present  due to the july fire at anaren europe  sales of that subsidiary to us customers in us dollars subject to possible currency losses are currently less than  per quarter and thus any possible losses due to currency fluctuations would not be material to the operating results of the company 
the company anticipates that this facility will be closing in the first half of fiscal
