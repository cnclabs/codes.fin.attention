critical accounting policies allowance for doubtful accounts we record a provision for doubtful accounts based on specific identification of our accounts receivable 
this involves a degree of judgement based on discussion with our internal sales and marketing groups  our customer base and the examination of the financial stability of our customers 
there can be no assurance that our estimates will match actual amounts ultimately written off 
during periods of downturn in the market for our products or economic recession  a greater degree of risk exists concerning the ultimate collectability of our accounts receivable due to the impact that these conditions might have on our customer base 
sales returns an allowance is established for possible return of products 
the amount of the allowance is an estimate  which is based on historical ratios of returns to sales  the historical average length of time between the sale and the return and other factors 
though management considers these balances adequate and proper  changes in customers behavior versus historical experience or changes in the company s return policies are among the factors that would result in materially different amounts for this item 
inventory valuation the company s inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
reserves for overstock and obsolescence are estimated 
the amount of the reserve is determined based on projected sales information  plans for discontinued products and other factors

in  we recorded a  charge reflecting an adjustment to our inventory to lower of cost or market 
this charge represents excess and obsolete inventory 
income taxes in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements  management calculates income taxes 
this includes estimating current tax liability as well as assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and book accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are recorded on the balance sheet 
these assets and liabilities are analyzed regularly and management assesses the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
warranty we provide a standard product warranty program for our product lines and a five year warranty on certain equipment purchased from a third party and installed at our customer location 
we provide reserves for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
we estimate the costs of our warranty obligations based on our warranty policy or applicable contractual warranty  our historical experience of known product failure rates  and use of materials and service delivery costs incurred in correcting product failures 
management reviews the estimated warranty liability on a quarterly basis to determine its adequacy 
though management considers these balances adequate and proper  changes in the company s warranty policy or a significant change in product defects versus historical averages are among the factors that would result in materially different amounts for this item

based upon these assessments  we determined that our current goodwill balances were not impaired as of january  we will continue to reassess the value of our business units and related goodwill balances at the beginning of each year or at other times if events have occurred or circumstances exist that indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable

 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin

a guarantor is required to recognize a liability for the obligation it has undertaken in issuing a guarantee  including the ongoing obligation to stand ready to perform over the term of the guarantee in the event that the specified triggering events or conditions occur 
the objective of the initial measurement of that liability is the fair value of the guarantee at its inception 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  fin also requires expanded disclosure of information related to product warranty amounts recorded in the financial statements 
the disclosure provisions are effective for interim and annual periods ending after december  the adoption of fin is further discussed with appropriate disclosures in note of the consolidated financials statements

 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment to sfas no
