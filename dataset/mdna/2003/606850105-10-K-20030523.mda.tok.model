multipurpose room furniture 
the company s multipurpose room furniture line consists of lightweight  durable  folding leg tables  stacking chairs  folding chairs  lecterns  and other related products 
these products are used in multipurpose rooms of educational  recreational  hotel and hospitality  government  office  healthcare  religious and other public assembly facilities 
historically  growth in this segment has come from an expanding base of new customers  from increasing sales to existing customers and from expansion of the company s multipurpose room product line 
the current and future growth of the company s multipurpose room furniture operations is largely dependent upon its ability to successfully introduce and market new product lines of multipurpose room furniture and its ability to profitably increase its market penetration into existing and new markets 
multipurpose room furniture outlook 
the downturn in the domestic and international economy  particularly the downturn in the furniture industry and some of the company s target markets such as education and recreation  has negatively impacted the company s historical sales growth rates in fiscal and the events of september  as well as the subsequent terror threats and military conflicts have also negatively impacted many of the company s markets  particularly travel related markets such as the hotel and hospitality  recreational and public assembly markets 
industry experts reported a decline in the us office furniture market of for calendar year and are predicting further declines of in calendar year the company has also seen significant competitive pressure in its multipurpose room table markets from lower priced thermo formed and blow molded tables and expects this pressure to continue 
although the company s multipurpose room operations for fiscal performed better than industry estimates  sales volumes still were percent lower compared to the prior year 
the company anticipates that weakness in furniture demand will continue until overall business conditions improve 
recently  order rates have improved and the company anticipates that sales volumes during the quarter ending june  may be as much as to percent higher than the prior year s first quarter 
still  the company has been reducing costs to preserve margins and maintain its ability to generate high levels of positive cash flow 
despite these efforts  the company  for a variety of reasons including those described elsewhere herein  may not be successful in achieving this sales level in the first quarter or increasing its margins and generating high levels of positive cash flow 
healthcare seating 
through broda  the company markets a line of healthcare seating products to customers in canada and the united states 
broda s operations are based in waterloo  ontario  canada 
broda focuses on providing products which assist long term care patients with advanced needs due to a debilitating condition or disease  and has developed a line of premium priced geriatric seating products 
broda chairs are serving a very specific niche in the healthcare market and thus are not competing in the commodity oriented general healthcare seating market 
healthcare seating outlook 
the company believes that the specialty healthcare seating market is less subject to economic pressures than the company s multipurpose room furniture operations 
during the year ended march   the company s healthcare seating operations were not negatively impacted by the downturn in the us economy 
however  the medical and healthcare industry is more subject to regulatory changes that could affect the demand for broda s products 
the company is not aware of any regulatory changes in the near future that would have a substantial and negative impact on this business 
the company s healthcare seating operation s future growth is largely dependent upon increasing its market penetration into the us market and other foreign markets and new products

critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
these principles require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and footnotes 
the critical accounting policies for the company which require management to make judgments and assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time of the estimate include the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  the reserve for obsolete inventory  accruals for warranty expense  values for the discontinued operations  intangible assets  notes receivable  and income taxes 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable the company exercises considerable judgment in determining the ultimate collectability of its accounts receivable 
several factors are used in making these judgments including the customer credit quality  historical write off experience and current economic trends 
the company reviews these factors quarterly  and the allowance is adjusted accordingly 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  an additional allowance may be required 
reserve for obsolete inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost  on a first in  first out basis  or market 
additionally  the company evaluates its inventory reserves in terms of excess and obsolete exposures

the company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
this warranty obligation is affected by failure rates  the introduction of new products  and the costs of material and labor to repair or replace the product 
the company regularly assesses the adequacy of its accrual for warranty expense based upon historical warranty rates and anticipated future warranty rates 
values for the discontinued operations on november   the company completed its plan for exiting and selling the assets of the specialty office seating and systems segment of its business 
this plan was originally approved by the company s board of directors on june  during the quarter ended june   the company developed and approved a plan for exiting and selling the specialty office seating and systems furniture segment of its operations 
since that time and in accordance with apb  the company has treated the do group and centercore segment of its operations as a discontinued operation 
at the time that the plan was originally formulated  an estimated  loss was accrued for in the three months ended june  to account for the expected losses on disposal and estimated operating losses through the disposal date 
after the completion of the plan  the actual net loss  after tax has been determined to be  since the amount of loss that was originally estimated and accrued for in the june quarter of  was higher than this amount  the company is recognizing a gain  net of tax  of  in the period ended december  the company did retain certain assets and liabilities of the segment after completion of the sales plan 
considerable judgment was used to estimate the value of these assets and liabilities based on many factors including the net expected realizable value of the remaining accounts receivable  the realization of tax benefits  and potential remaining expenses 
goodwill and other intangible assets the company reviews annually the carrying value of its goodwill and other intangible assets 
the goodwill arose from the broda acquisition and the other intangible asset is intellectual property related to a startup development company in which the company has invested 
during the last fiscal year  the company reviewed the goodwill related to the broda acquisition 
this review is performed using estimates of future cash flows 
if the carrying value of the intangible asset is considered impaired  an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value 
no impairment charges have been recorded related to broda goodwill or the intellectual property related to the startup development company 
notes receivable the company reviews its notes receivable to determine likely collectability 
since the notes are with entities without a history of an ability to create future cash flows  the company bases its belief in their collectability upon its understanding of the potential future success of the products being developed or on the company s belief of what the liquidation value of the operation would be 
at this time  the company has created reserves on some of these notes receivable 
due to the high level of uncertainty in the success of these products  these notes receivable may not be ultimately realized

income taxes the company has not provided a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets recorded in the financial statements

management believes that it is more likely than not that future earnings will be sufficient to recover deferred tax assets 
pension liability the company has certain alleged obligations of up to million related to a defined benefit pension plan resulting from exiting and selling its specialty office seating and systems business 
the company does not believe that it is liable for this amount and plans to vigorously defend its position 
at this time  the company is unable to determine what its liability will be  if any

for the year ended march   approximately percent of the company s net sales  percent of the company s cost of products sold  and percent of the company s operating expenses were denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations did not have a material impact on the financial results of the company during fiscal the company s healthcare chair operations have occasionally entered into forward contracts for specific us dollar denominated accounts receivable
