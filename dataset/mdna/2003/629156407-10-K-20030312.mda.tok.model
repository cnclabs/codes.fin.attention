item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates the accompanying management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to inventory reserves  impairments of investments in marketable equity securities and investments accounted for by the equity method  the recoverability of other long lived assets  pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and the underlying actuarial assumptions related thereto  and the realization of deferred income tax assets and accruals for environmental remediation  litigation  income tax and other contingencies 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
actual results may differ from previously estimated amounts under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements o inventory allowances 
the company provides reserves for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable finished goods inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand for its products and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional finished goods inventory reserves may be required 
the company provides reserves for tools and supplies inventory generally based on both historical and expected future usage requirements 
o valuation and impairment of marketable equity securities 
the company owns investments in certain companies that are accounted for either as marketable equity securities or under the equity method 
for all of such investments  the company records an impairment charge when it believes an investment has experienced a decline in fair value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
at december   the carrying value of all of the company s marketable securities exceeded the cost basis of each of such investments 
with respect to the company s direct and indirect investment in tremont  which represented approximately of the aggregate carrying value of all of the company s marketable equity securities at december   the million aggregate carrying value of such investment exceeded its million cost basis by about 
in february valhi completed a series of merger transactions pursuant to which  among other things  tremont group  inc tremont group and tremont both became wholly owned subsidiaries of valhi 
under these merger transactions  i valhi issued million shares of its common stock to the company in return for the company s ownership interest in tremont group and ii valhi issued shares of its common stock plus cash in lieu of fractional shares to all tremont stockholders other than valhi and tremont group in exchange for each share of tremont common stock held by such stockholders 
the company received approximately  shares of valhi common stock in the second transaction 
the number of shares of valhi common stock issued to the company in exchange for the company s ownership interest in tremont group was equal to the company s pro rata interest in the shares of tremont common stock held by tremont group  adjusted for the same exchange ratio 
the valhi common stock owned by the company is restricted under sec rule o impairments of long lived assets 
the company recognizes an impairment charge associated with its long lived assets  including property and equipment  whenever it determines that recovery of such long lived asset is not probable 
such determination is made in accordance with applicable gaap requirement associated with the long lived asset  and is based upon  among other things  estimates of the amount of future net cash flows to be generated by the long lived asset and estimates of the current fair value of the asset 
adverse changes in such estimates of future net cash flows or estimates of fair value could result in an inability to recover the carrying value of the long lived asset  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge to be recognized in the future 
under applicable gaap statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  property and equipment is not assessed for impairment unless certain impairment indicators  as defined  are present 
during  no such impairment indicators were present with respect to the company s net property and equipment 
under applicable gaap sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is required to be reviewed for impairment at least on an annual basis 
the company s goodwill relates to an acquisition completed in january  and such goodwill will initially be reviewed for impairment during o deferred income tax valuation allowance 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred income tax assets to the amount that is believed to be realizable under the more likely than not recognition criteria 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  it is possible that in the future the company may change its estimate of the amount of the deferred income tax assets that would more likely than not be realized  resulting in an adjustment to the deferred income tax asset valuation allowance that would either increase or decrease  as applicable  reported net income in the period such change in estimate was made 
o defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans 
the company s defined benefit pension and postretirement benefits other than pensions opeb expenses and obligations are calculated based on several estimates  including discount rates  expected rates of returns on plan assets and expected healthcare trend rates 
the company reviews these rates annually with the assistance of its actuaries 
see further discussion of the potential effect of these estimates in the assumptions on defined benefit pension plans and opeb plans sections in the liquidity and capital resources section of this md a 
o other contingencies 
the company records an accrual for environmental  legal  income tax and other contingencies when estimated future expenditures associated with such contingencies become probable  and the amounts can be reasonably estimated 
however  new information may become available  or circumstances such as applicable laws and regulations may change  thereby resulting in an increase or decrease in the amount required to be accrued for such matters and therefore a decrease or increase in reported net income in the period of such change 
other significant accounting policies and use of estimates are described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements

the gain was excluded from the determination of operating income 
the million of business interruption proceeds recognized in were allocated between other income  excluding corporate  which reflects recovery of lost margin million and as a reduction of cost of sales to offset unallocated period costs million 
the business interruption insurance proceeds distorted kronos operating income margin percentage in as there were no sales associated with the lost margin operating income recognized 
no additional insurance recoveries related to the leverkusen fire are expected to be received 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
the company expects tio industry demand in to increase slightly over levels 
kronos tio production volume in is expected to approximate kronos tio sales volume 
in december and january  kronos announced additional price increases in europe and north america which averaged in europe and in north america 
kronos is hopeful that it will realize prices increases  but the extent to which kronos can realize price increases during will depend on improving market conditions and global economic recovery  which may be negatively impacted by the potential for international conflict 
overall  the company expects its tio operating income in will be higher than  primarily due to higher average tio selling prices 
the company s expectations as to the future prospects of the company and the tio industry are based upon a number of factors beyond the company s control  including worldwide growth of gross domestic product  competition in the market place  unexpected or earlier than expected capacity additions and technological advances 
if actual developments differ from the company s expectations  the company s results of operations could be unfavorably affected 
the company s efforts to debottleneck kronos production facilities to meet long term demand continue to prove successful

the company s non us sales and operating costs are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations which may impact reported earnings and may affect the comparability of period to period revenues and expenses expressed in us dollars 
a significant amount of the company s sales approximately in are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  principally the euro  other major european currencies  and the canadian dollar 
certain purchases of raw materials  primarily titanium containing feedstocks for the company s chloride facilities  are denominated in us dollars  while labor and other production costs are primarily denominated in local currencies 
fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies increased sales by million in compared to primarily due to a weaker us dollar compared to the euro and decreased sales by million in compared to primarily as a result of a stronger us dollar compared to the euro 
when translated to us dollars using currency exchange rates prevailing during the respective periods  kronos average selling prices for decreased from kronos average selling prices in us dollars for decreased from the effect of the weaker us dollar on kronos operating costs  that are not denominated in us dollars  increased operating costs in compared with the effect of the stronger us dollar on kronos operating costs that are not denominated in us dollars reduced operating costs in compared with in addition  sales to export markets are typically denominated in us dollars and a weaker us dollar decreases margins on these sales at the company s non us subsidiaries 
the unfavorable margin on export sales tends to offset the favorable effect of translating local currency profits to us dollars when the dollar is weaker 
as a result  the net impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations on operating income in and was not significant when compared to the year earlier periods

however  the company has provided a deferred tax valuation allowance against substantially all of these income tax loss carryforwards because the company currently believes they do not meet the more likely than not recognition criteria 
the german federal government has proposed certain changes to its income tax law  including certain changes that would impose limitations on the annual utilization of income tax loss carryforwards that  as proposed  would become effective retroactively to january  since the company has provided a deferred income tax asset valuation allowance against substantially all of the german tax loss carryforwards  any limitation on the company s ability to utilize such carryforwards resulting from enactment of any of these proposals would not have a material impact on the company s net deferred income tax liability 
however  if enacted  the proposed changes could have a material impact on the company s ability to make full annual use of its german income tax loss carryforwards  which would significantly affect the company s future income tax expense and future income tax payments 
at december   the company had  for us federal income tax purposes  a net operating loss carryforward of approximately million  of which million expires in  million expires in and million expires in and approximately million of alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards with no expiration date 
environmental matters and litigation the company has been named as a defendant  prp  or both  in a number of legal proceedings associated with environmental matters  including waste disposal sites  mining locations and facilities currently or previously owned  operated or used by the company  certain of which are on the us epa s superfund national priorities list or similar state lists 
on a quarterly basis  the company evaluates the potential range of its liability at sites where it has been named as a prp or defendant  including sites for which ems has contractually assumed the company s obligation 
the company believes it has adequate accruals for reasonably estimable costs of such matters  but the company s ultimate liability may be affected by a number of factors  including changes in remedial alternatives and costs  the allocation of such costs among prps  and the solvency of other prps 
the company is also a defendant in a number of legal proceedings seeking damages for personal injury and property damage arising out of the sale of lead pigments and lead based paints 
there is no assurance that the company will not incur future liability in respect of this pending litigation in view of the inherent uncertainties involved in court and jury rulings in pending and possible future cases 
however  based on  among other things  the results of such litigation to date  the company believes that the pending lead pigment and paint litigation is without merit 
the company has not accrued any amounts for such pending litigation 
liability that may result  if any  cannot reasonably be estimated 
the company currently believes the disposition of all claims and disputes  individually and in the aggregate  should not have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
considering the company s previous involvement in the lead pigment and lead based paint businesses  the company expects that additional lead pigment and lead based paint litigation  asserting similar or different legal theories and seeking similar or different types of damage and relief to that described in item legal proceedings  may be filed 
see item legal proceedings and note to the consolidated financial statements 
foreign operations as discussed above  the company has substantial operations located outside the united states for which the functional currency is not the us dollar 
as a result  the reported amount of the company s assets and liabilities related to its non us operations  and therefore the company s consolidated net assets  will fluctuate based upon changes in currency exchange rates 
as of january   the functional currency of the company s german  belgian  dutch and french operations have been converted to the euro from their respective national currencies 
at december   the company had substantial net assets denominated in the euro  canadian dollar  norwegian kroner and united kingdom pound sterling

assumptions on defined benefit pension plans and opeb plans defined benefit pension plans 
the company maintains various defined benefit pension plans in the us  europe and canada 
the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans using sfas no 
 employer s accounting for pensions 
under sfas no 
 defined benefit pension plan expense and prepaid and accrued pension cost are each recognized based on certain actuarial assumptions  principally the assumed discount rate  the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed increase in future compensation levels 
the company recognized consolidated defined benefit pension plan expense of million in  million in and million in the amount of funding requirements for these defined benefit pension plans is generally based upon applicable regulation such as erisa in the us  and will generally differ from pension expense recognized under sfas no 
for financial reporting purposes 
contributions made by the company to all of its defined benefit pension plans aggregated million in  million in and million in the discount rates the company utilizes for determining defined benefit pension expense and the related pension obligations are based on current interest rates earned on long term bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by recognized rating agencies in the applicable country where the defined benefit pension benefits are being paid 
in addition  the company receives advice about appropriate discount rates to use based upon discussions with the company s third party actuaries  who may in some cases utilize their own market indices 
the discount rates are adjusted as of each valuation date september th for the company s plans to reflect then current interest rates on such long term bonds 
such discount rates are used to determine the actuarial present value of the pension obligations as of december st of that year  and such discount rates are also used to determine the interest component of defined benefit pension expense for the following year 
at december   approximately   and of the projected benefit obligations for all of the company s defined benefit pension plans were attributable to the us  germany  canada and norway  respectively 
because the company maintains defined benefit pension plans in several different countries in north america and europe  and because the interest rate environment differs from country to country  the company uses several different discount rate assumptions in determining its defined benefit pension plan obligations and expense 
the company used the following discount rates for its defined benefit pension plans discount rates used for the following periods obligation at obligation at obligation at december  and december  and december  and expense in expense in expense in us us germany canada norway the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets represents the estimated average rate of earnings expected to be earned on the funds invested or to be invested in the plans assets provided to fund the benefit payments inherent in the projected benefit obligation 
unlike the discount rate  which is adjusted each year based on changes in current long term interest rates  the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets will not necessarily change based upon the actual  short term performance of the plan assets in any given year 
defined benefit pension expense each year is based upon the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets for each plan and the actual fair value of the plan assets as of the beginning of the year 
differences between the expected return on plan assets for a given year and the actual return are deferred and amortized over future periods based either upon the expected average remaining service life of the active plan participants for plans for which benefits are still being earned by active employees or the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants for plans for which benefits are not still being earned by active employees 
at december   approximately   and related to plan assets for the company s plans in the us  germany  canada and norway  respectively 
because the company maintains defined benefit pension plans in several different countries in north america and europe  because the plan assets in different countries are invested in a different mix of investments and because the long term rates of return for different investments differs from country to country  the company uses several different long term rate of return on plan asset assumptions in determining its defined benefit pension plan expense 
in determining the expected long term rate of return on plan asset assumptions  the company considers the long term asset mix eg equity vs 
fixed income for the assets for each of its plans and the expected long term rates of return for such asset components 
in addition  the company receives advice about appropriate long term rates of return to use based upon discussions with the company s third party actuaries 
such assumed asset mixes are summarized below o in the us  the company currently has a plan asset target allocation of to equity managers and to fixed income managers current plan asset allocation at december  was to equity managers and to fixed income managers  with an expected long term rate of return for such investments of approximately and  respectively 
o in germany  the composition of plan assets is established to satisfy the requirements of the german insurance commissioner 
the current plan asset allocation at december  was to equity managers and to fixed income managers 
o in canada  the company currently has a plan asset target allocation of to equity managers and to fixed income managers  with an expected long term rate of return for such investments to average approximately basis points above the applicable equity or fixed income index 
the current plan asset allocation at december  was to equity managers and to fixed income managers 
o in norway  the company currently has a plan asset target allocation of to equity managers and to fixed income managers  with an expected long term rate of return for such investments of approximately and  respectively 
the current plan asset allocation at december  was to equity managers and to fixed income managers 
the company regularly reviews its actual asset allocation for each of its plans  and will periodically rebalance the investments in each plan to more accurately reflect the targeted allocation when considered appropriate 
the company s assumed long term rates of return on plan assets for  and were as follows us germany canada norway the company currently expects to utilize the same long term rate of return on plan asset assumptions in as it used in for purposes of determining the defined benefit pension plan expense 
to the extent that a plan s particular pension benefit formula calculates the pension benefit in whole or in part based upon future compensation levels  the projected benefit obligation and the pension expense will be based in part upon expected increases in future compensation levels 
for all of the company s plans for which the benefit formula is so calculated  the company generally bases the assumed expected increase in future compensation levels based upon average long term inflation rates for the applicable country 
in addition to the actuarial assumptions discussed above  because the company maintains defined benefit pension plans outside the us the amount of recognized defined benefit pension expense and the amount of prepaid and accrued pension cost will vary based upon relative changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
based on the actuarial assumptions described above and the company s current expectation for what actual average foreign currency exchange rates will be during  the company expects its defined benefit pension expense will approximate million in in comparison  the company expects to be required to make approximately million of contributions to such plans during defined benefit pension expense and the amount recognized as prepaid and accrued pension costs are based upon the actuarial assumptions discussed above 
the company believes all of the actuarial assumptions used are reasonable and appropriate 
if the company had lowered the assumed discount rate by basis points for all of its plans as of december   the company s aggregate projected benefit obligation would have increased by approximately million at that date  and the company s defined benefit pension expense would be expected to increase by approximately million during similarly  if the company lowered the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets by basis points for all of its plans  the company s defined benefit pension expense would be expected to increase by approximately 
million during opeb plans 
certain subsidiaries of the company currently provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retired employees 
the company provides such opeb benefits to retirees in the us and canada 
the company accounts for such opeb costs under sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
under sfas no 
 opeb expense and accrued opeb costs are based on certain actuarial assumptions  principally the assumed discount rate and the assumed rate of increases in future health care costs 
the company recognized consolidated opeb expense income of 
million in  
million in and 
million in similar to defined benefit pension benefits  the amount of funding will differ from the expense recognized for financial reporting purposes  and contributions to the plans to cover benefit payments aggregated million in  
million in and million in company contributions were lower in and compared with due to the contribution by the company to a trust in of shares of common stock received from demutualization of an insurance company from which the company had purchased certain insurance policies 
the shares were sold by the trust for million in and the proceeds were used to pay opeb benefit claims in  and the assumed discount rates the company utilizes for determining opeb expense and the related accrued opeb obligation is generally based on the same discount rates the company utilizes for its us and canadian defined benefit pension plans 
in estimating the health care cost trend rate  the company considers its actual healthcare cost experience  future benefit structures  industry trends and advice from its third party actuaries 
during each of the past three years  the company has assumed that the relative increase in health care costs will generally trend downward over the next several years  reflecting  among other things  assumed increases in efficiency in the health care system and industry wide cost containment initiatives 
for example  at december   the expected rate of increase in future health care costs ranges from in  declining to in and thereafter 
based on the actuarial assumptions described above and the company s current expectation for what actual average foreign currency exchange rates will be during  the company expects its opeb expense will approximate 
million in in comparison  the company expects to be required to make approximately million of contributions to such plans during opeb expense and the amount recognized as accrued opeb costs are based upon the actuarial assumptions discussed above 
the company believes all of the actuarial assumptions used are reasonable and appropriate 
if the company had lowered the assumed discount rate by basis points for all of its opeb plans as of december   the company s aggregate accumulated opeb obligation would have increased by approximately 
million at that date  and the company s opeb expense would be expected to increase by a nil amount during similarly  if the assumed future health care cost trend rate had been increased by basis points  the company s accumulated opeb obligation would have increased by approximately million at december   and opeb expense would have increased by 
million in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general the company is exposed to market risk from changes in currency exchange rates  interest rates and equity security prices 
in the past  the company has periodically entered into interest rate swaps or other types of contracts in order to manage a portion of its interest rate market risk 
otherwise  the company has not generally entered into forward or option contracts to manage such market risks  nor has the company entered into any such contract or other type of derivative instrument for trading purposes 
the company was not a party to any forward or derivative option contracts related to currency exchange rates  interest rates or equity security prices at december  or see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
interest rates the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  primarily related to indebtedness 
at december   the company s aggregate indebtedness was split between of fixed rate instruments and of variable rate borrowings fixed rate and variable rate 
the large percentage of fixed rate debt instruments minimizes earnings volatility which would result from changes in interest rates 
the following table presents principal amounts and weighted average interest rates  by contractual maturity dates  for the company s aggregate indebtedness at december  and at december   all outstanding fixed rate indebtedness was denominated in euros all fixed rate indebtedness denominated in us dollars  and all outstanding variable rate indebtedness was denominated in either euros or norwegian kroner 
information shown below for such euro and norwegian kroner denominated indebtedness is presented in its us dollar equivalent at december  using that date s exchange rate of 
euro per us dollar euro per us dollar and norwegian kroner per us dollar norwegian kroner per us dollar 
certain norwegian kroner denominated capital leases totaling million in have been excluded from the table below 
amount carrying fair interest maturity indebtedness value value rate date in millions fixed rate indebtedness euro denominated kii notes variable rate indebtedness non us dollar denominated european credit facility euro denominated norwegian kroner denominated at december   fixed rate indebtedness aggregated million fair value million with a weighted average interest rate of  variable rate indebtedness at such date aggregated million  which approximated fair value  with a weighted average interest rate of 
all of such fixed rate indebtedness was denominated in us dollars 
such variable rate indebtedness was denominated in the euro and the norwegian kroner 
certain norwegian kroner denominated capital leases totaling million at december  have been excluded from the above analysis 
currency exchange rates the company is exposed to market risk arising from changes in currency exchange rates as a result of manufacturing and selling its products worldwide 
earnings are primarily affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to the euro  canadian dollar  norwegian kroner and the united kingdom pound sterling 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a discussion of risks and uncertainties related to the conversion of certain of these currencies to the euro 
at december   the company had million of indebtedness denominated in euros million and million of indebtedness denominated in norwegian kroner million 
the potential increase in the us dollar equivalent of the principal amount outstanding resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in exchange rates would be approximately million million 
marketable equity and marketable debt security prices the company is exposed to market risk due to changes in prices of the marketable equity securities which are held 
the fair value of such equity securities at december  and was million and million  respectively 
the potential change in the aggregate fair value of these investments  assuming a change in prices  would be million and million  respectively 
the fair value of restricted marketable debt securities at december  and was million and million  respectively 
the potential change in the aggregate fair value of these investments assuming a change in prices would be million and million  respectively 
other the company believes there are certain shortcomings in the sensitivity analyses presented above  which analyses are required under the sec s regulations 
for example  the hypothetical effect of changes in interest rates discussed above ignores the potential effect on other variables which affect the company s results of operations and cash flows  such as demand for the company s products  sales volumes and selling prices and operating expenses 
contrary to the above assumptions  changes in interest rates rarely result in simultaneous parallel shifts along the yield curve 
accordingly  the amounts presented above are not necessarily an accurate reflection of the potential losses the company would incur assuming the hypothetical changes in market prices were actually to occur 
the above discussion and estimated sensitivity analysis amounts include forward looking statements of market risk which assume hypothetical changes in market prices 
actual future market conditions could differ materially from such assumptions 
accordingly  such forward looking statements should not be considered to be projections by the company of future events  gains or losses
