overview since our inception in january  we have been engaged primarily in the design and development and more recently the manufacture and sale of noninvasive  advanced medical products 
our products  which incorporate proprietary materials and electronics technology  are used in neurological monitoring applications 
our initial products were our e net headpiece and disposable hydrodot biosensors and custom electronics  which are packaged as the hydrodot neuromonitoring system 
we also have an additional neurological monitoring product  the patient state analyzer psa which received fda k approval on june  we received fda k clearance on october   for the psarray  which is a new frontal only disposable array sensor which attaches to and is used with our psa consciousness monitoring system 
we have a limited history of operations and have experienced significant operating losses since our inception 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
the psa and the hydrodot neuromonitoring system are currently our principal commercial products 
we anticipate that our operating results will fluctuate on a quarterly basis for the foreseeable future due to several factors  including actions relating to regulatory and reimbursement matters  the extent to which our products gain market acceptance  introduction of alternative means for neurophysiological monitoring and competition 
results of operations will also be affected by the progress of clinical trials and in house development activities  and the extent to which we establish distribution channels for our products domestically and internationally 
since the third quarter of  substantially all of our sales were to baxter healthcare corporation baxter 
there can be no assurance we will achieve significant commercial revenues or profitability 
in may  we entered into a distribution arrangement with baxter for the exclusive distribution of our psa in the united states 
the agreement was amended on february  under the terms of the agreement  baxter is required to make quarterly minimum purchases under the contract 
the penalty for purchases below minimum requirements is loss of exclusivity 
the contract is for five years from may and is cancelable by either party after december  we began shipments of the psa in the third quarter of and began shipping the psarray  our new fda cleared product  in the fourth quarter of during  we began development of the psarray  which is a new frontal only disposable array sensor which attaches to and is used with our psa consciousness monitoring system 
the psarray was developed in an effort to improve market acceptance of the psa we submitted a k application for the commercial clearance of the psarray on february  and received fda k clearance for the psarray on october  the introduction and successful commercialization of this product is critical to our future success 
we introduced this product at the annual american society of anesthesiologists asa meeting in october on february   we signed an amendment to our us distribution agreement with baxter for the psa level of sedation monitor 
the highlights of the enhanced agreement included targeted sales  marketing and product development milestones  segmentation of the operating room or  intensive care unit icu and interventional sedation unit isu markets to enable us and baxter to focus on the particular requirements of each market segment  minimum purchase requirements  innovative marketing programs to promote our technology  and expansion of the territory to include canada critical accounting policies in december  the securities and exchange commission requested that all registrants discuss their most critical accounting policies in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and operations 
the commission indicated that a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results  and requires management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we believe the following accounting policies to be critical use of estimates we prepare our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
these principles require that we make estimates and use assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
significant estimates are made in connection with determining the market value of inventory  if lower than cost  establishing allowances for bad debts and warranty costs  and other accruals 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue for product sales upon shipment  net of allowances for discounts and estimated returns which are also provided for at the time of shipment in accordance with securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
inventories inventories are recorded at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
we review our inventories for excess and obsolete inventory on a periodic basis 
we believe that inventory units on hand included in our balance sheet at december  are fully realizable and are expected to be sold within the next twelve months 
results of operations years ended december  and revenues revenues decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to lack of sales of the psa monitor during we did not ship any psa units during as compared to units shipped in we recognized revenue of  during the fourth quarter of related to the removal of an acceptance contingency on units shipped to baxter during the reduced level of revenues in was due to baxter s decision not to purchase any additional psa units during due to lower than expected market demand and in anticipation of the commercial release of the psarrray  a new frontal only disposable array sensor which attaches to and is used with our psa system 
the psarray  which received fda k clearance on october   was developed in an effort to improve market acceptance of the psa initial shipments to baxter of the psarray during the fourth quarter of accounted for revenue of  future psa revenues are entirely dependent on the acceptance of the new psarray by anesthesiologists 
there is no assurance that this will occur 
sales of our hydrodot neuromonitoring products increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  cost of products sold cost of products sold decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to decreased product costs related to the psa units in  coupled with a provision for excess inventory of million in and the recognition of a loss on fixed purchase commitments in excess of expected demand during the charge in was a result of baxter s failure to meet its minimum purchase requirements under the distribution agreement  which created uncertainty as to the future sales volume of the psa gross margin the negative gross profit margin incurred during the year ended december  resulted from costs of the product incurred together with headcount and overhead costs required in our manufacturing group exceeding the reported revenues 
staff reductions undertaken in april of have lowered expenses in the reduction in the negative gross margin in was also due to  of revenue recognized in related to the removal of an acceptance contingency in for which the related cost of sales was recorded in the costs were recorded in due to the uncertainty as to the acceptance of the units 
the negative gross profit margin incurred during the year ended december  resulted from selling psa units at a volume less than what was needed to cover fixed and variable costs in our manufacturing department as well as the provision for excess inventory of million taken during the year ended december  we expect costs of products sold to increase consistent with increases in revenues of the psa in research and development expenses research and development expenses consisting principally of headcount related expenses  clinical study costs  and consulting fees  decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in outside consulting costs associated with development of the psa  as well as staff reductions and other discretionary expense reductions undertaken in the second quarter of selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this decrease was due to decreased sales and marketing expenses incurred  such as travel  headcount related expenses and outside market research consulting related to the commercialization of the psa additionally  we incurred investment banking fees in which were not incurred in interest income interest income decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this decrease was due to lower average cash balances available for investment in  along with lower interest rates 
income taxes we have experienced operating losses since inception and therefore have not paid any federal income taxes since our inception 
we account for income taxes under statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas 
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future earnings  if any  the timing and amount of which are uncertain 
accordingly  valuation allowances  in amounts equal to the net deferred tax assets as of december  and  were established in each period to reflect these uncertainties 
at december   we had tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million available to offset federal taxable income  which expire in varying amounts through  and million to offset state taxable income  which expire in varying amounts through we also have research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million available to offset income taxes  which expire in varying amounts through in accordance with section of the internal revenue code  the use of the above carryforwards will be subject to annual limitations based upon ownership changes of our stock which have occurred 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before full utilization 
years ended december  and revenues revenues increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to the shipment of units of the psa during compared to shipments of units during under our distribution agreement with baxter 
the shipments during were concentrated in the first quarter  achieving million of revenues during such quarter 
during the second  third and fourth quarters of  orders by and  consequently  shipments to baxter were not sufficient to meet the exclusivity provisions of the distribution agreement 
sales of our hydrodot neuromonitoring products of  in were relatively unchanged compared to cost of products sold cost of products sold increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this increase was due to a million charge to cost of products sold in which included a million provision for inventory on hand in excess of expected demand and a million provision for non cancelable purchase orders 
the charge was a result of baxter s failure to meet its minimum purchase requirements under the distribution agreement  which created uncertainty as to the future sales volume of the psa gross margin the negative gross profit margin during resulted from selling psa units at a volume less than what was needed to cover fixed and variable costs in our manufacturing group as well as the provision for excess inventory and loss on fixed purchase commitments of million taken during the negative gross profit margin in resulted from costs of the product and the level of headcount and overhead required in our manufacturing group 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consisting principally of headcount related expenses  clinical study costs  and consulting fees  increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to increased headcount  outside consulting and product development costs associated with continued development of the psa and the development of the psarray selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this increase was due to increased selling and marketing efforts along with an extensive market research study in we added nine sg a employees during and increased our costs related to the use of consultants by 
interest income interest income decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this was due to lower average cash balances available for investment in income taxes we have experienced operating losses since inception and therefore have not paid any federal income taxes since our inception 
we account for income taxes under statement of financial accounting standards no

realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future earnings  if any  the timing and amount of which are uncertain 
accordingly  valuation allowances  in amounts equal to the net deferred tax assets as of december  and  have been established in each period to reflect these uncertainties 
selected quarterly financial data quarter ended march  june  september  december  march  june  september  december  revenues      cost of products sold     gross margin deficit     operating loss     net loss     basic and diluted net loss per share liquidity and capital resources at december   our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were  as compared to  at december  our operating activities used cash of  in the year ended december  as compared to  in the year ended december  the  decrease in net cash used in compared to was due to the reduced net loss coupled with decreased inventory purchases  partially offset by a large decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses along with a large decrease in cash provided by accounts receivables 
net cash provided by investing activities in the year ended december  was  as compared with  provided in the year ended december  the decrease was due to a decrease in the net proceeds from the sale of short term investments of  partially offset by a decrease in equipment purchases in the amount of our financing activities provided cash of in the year ended december  as compared to  of cash provided in the year ended december  this decrease was due to reduced stock option activity during the year ended december  our principal source of liquidity at december  consists of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  which aggregate million 
we anticipate that our existing cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments will be sufficient to conduct operations as planned only until october  absent additional revenues 
we believe that coupled with anticipated revenues  we will have funds to conduct operations until february as a result  there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
we plan to raise capital through equity and or debt issuance when  and if  such capital is available to us 
there is no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital on acceptable terms  or at all 
future equity financings may result in dilution to the holders of our common stock 
future debt financings may require us to pledge assets and to comply with financial and operational covenants 
if additional amounts can not be raised and we are unable to substantially reduce our expenses  we would suffer material adverse consequences to our business  financial condition and results of operations and would likely be required to seek other alternatives up to and including protection under the united states bankruptcy laws or cessation of operations 
we believe that the success of the psa is the most critical component to our ability to continue as a going concern 
we intend to sell the psa through our existing distributor  baxter  in north america and pursue a distributor for rest of the world rights 
although management and our current investors do not have any intention of liquidating the business  we would consider a sale of its technology if  in  our cash constraints would not allow us to execute our plan 
we are aware of one other company with products similar to the psa such competitor has an fda cleared frontal array for its consciousness monitoring system 
we believe that we are not at a significant disadvantage in marketing our products against this company 
we have a million investment in inventory related to the psa system 
the sale of this inventory will be subject to conditions that are generally outside our control 
more specifically  market acceptance of the psarray  a new frontal only disposable array sensor that attaches to and is used with our psa system  is critical to the sale of the finished units that are currently in inventory 
we submitted a k application for the commercial clearance of the psarray on february  and received fda k clearance for the psarray on october  we believe that inventory units on hand included in our balance sheet at december  are fully realizable and are expected to be sold within the next twelve months 
at december   we had available net operating loss carry forwards nol s of approximately million available to offset future federal taxable income  if any 
these nol s expire in varying amounts through at december   we also had research and development tax credit carry forwards of approximately million available to offset future income taxes  if any  which expire in varying amounts through since we have incurred only losses since our inception  and due to the degree of uncertainty related to the use of the loss and credit carry forwards  we have provided a full valuation allowance against these future tax benefits 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we invest in may have market risk 
this means that an increase in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to decrease 
to minimize this risk in the future  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds and government and non government debt securities 
due to the conservative nature of our investments and relatively short duration  interest rate risk is mitigated 
as of december   of our total portfolio will mature in one year or less
