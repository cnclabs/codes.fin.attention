item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations general we report our consolidated and individual segment results of operations on a or week fiscal year ending on the last thursday in may 
fiscal and fiscal were week years  while fiscal was a week year 
our upcoming fiscal will be a week year 
we divide our fiscal year into three week quarters and a final quarter consisting of or weeks 
our primary operations are reported in three business segments theatres  limited service lodging and hotels and resorts 
as a result of the sale of our kfc restaurants during fiscal  the restaurant business segment has been presented as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements and in this discussion 
historically  our first fiscal quarter has produced the strongest operating results because this period coincides with the typical summer seasonality of the movie theatre industry and the summer strength of our lodging businesses 
our third fiscal quarter has historically produced the weakest operating results primarily due to the effects of reduced travel during the winter months on our lodging businesses 
another record year for our movie theatres and significant year over year improvement in our hotels and resorts division contributed to increased operating income during fiscal  despite another difficult year for the lodging industry as a whole 
operating income from our two lodging divisions during fiscal continued to be negatively impacted by an overall reduction in business travel brought on by the economic environment and uncertainties surrounding the war with iraq 
in addition  investment losses during fiscal and the favorable impact of historic tax credits related to our kansas city hotel phillips project during fiscal resulted in decreased net earnings during fiscal compared to the prior year

fiscal versus fiscal all three operating divisions contributed to the increase in revenues during fiscal a second consecutive year of record operating performance from our theatre division and significant improvement in operating results from our hotels and resorts division resulted in an increase in overall operating income earnings before other income expense and income taxes  despite decreases in operating income from our limited service lodging division and a nearly million  or  increase in our total gas and electric costs for the year 
a slight increase in interest expense  investment losses reported during fiscal and a significantly higher effective income tax rate contributed to our decreased earnings from continuing operations and net earnings during fiscal we recognized a net investment loss of approximately  during fiscal  compared to investment income of million during the prior year 
investment income has historically included interest earned on cash equivalents and notes receivable  including notes related to the sale of timeshare units in our hotels and resorts division 
the significant decrease in investment income during fiscal was primarily the result of a million investment loss related to loans to and investments in baymont inns suites joint ventures that have experienced significant financial difficulties in the months following september  we have a limited number of joint ventures and our exposure to additional losses related to these joint ventures is not significant 
in addition  we also recognized a  pre tax investment loss on securities held during fiscal  whose decline in fair value was deemed to be other than temporary 
prior to this year  losses on these available for sale investments had previously been included in other comprehensive loss in shareholders equity 
our interest expense totaled million for fiscal  representing an increase of  or  over fiscal interest expense of million 
the increase in interest expense was the result of our issuance of fixed rate long term senior notes during the fourth quarter of fiscal in lieu of lower cost variable interest rate borrowings in place during the majority of fiscal the resulting increase in interest expense was partially offset by an overall reduction in our long term debt during fiscal compared to last year  due primarily to reduced capital expenditures during fiscal we recognized gains on disposition of property  equipment and investments in joint ventures from continuing operations of million during fiscal  compared to gains on disposition of property and equipment of million during fiscal the fiscal gains were primarily the result of the sales of a redeveloped former theatre location  two former restaurant locations and several parcels of excess land 
the timing of our periodic sales of property and equipment results in variations in the gains or losses that we report on disposition of property and equipment each year 
we are actively attempting to sell additional parcels of excess land and we believe that additional net gains on disposition of property and equipment may be recognized during the coming year 
we reported income tax expense on continuing operations for fiscal of million  an increase of million over fiscal despite reduced earnings before income taxes 
our effective tax rate for fiscal was compared to in fiscal the significantly lower effective tax rate during the prior year was the result of the favorable impact of federal and state historic tax credits related to the renovation of the hotel phillips in kansas city  missouri 
without these historic tax credits  our fiscal net earnings would have been approximately million  or 
per share  lower than we reported 
we anticipate that our effective tax rate during fiscal will likely remain in the range 
net earnings during fiscal included an after tax gain on sale of discontinued operations of million  or 
per share a detailed discussion of this item is included in the discontinued operations section 
weighted average shares outstanding were million for both fiscal and fiscal all per share data is presented on a diluted basis 
fiscal versus fiscal our theatre and hotels and resorts divisions contributed to the increase in revenues during fiscal comparisons to our fiscal revenues are impacted by the additional week of operations that we reported during that year 
the extra week during fiscal contributed million in revenues to our year end results 
a record operating performance from our theatre division resulted in an increase in overall operating income  despite decreases in operating income from our two lodging divisions 
comparisons to prior year results are adversely impacted by the additional week of operations that we reported during fiscal the extra week contributed million in operating income to our fiscal year end results 
on the other hand  significantly reduced utility and snow removal costs during fiscal compared to the prior year favorably impacted each of our divisions by a total of million and  respectively 
in addition to our increased fiscal operating income  reduced interest expense  increased gains on the disposition of property  equipment and investments in joint ventures and a reduced effective income tax rate contributed to our increased earnings from continuing operations and net earnings during fiscal comparisons of our fiscal earnings from continuing operations and net earnings to prior year results are negatively impacted by a non taxable gain of million recognized during fiscal from insurance contracts on the life of the company s founder  ben marcus 
our net interest expense  net of investment income  totaled million for fiscal this represented a decrease of million  or  from fiscal net interest expense of million 
this decrease was primarily the result of lower short term interest rates  in addition to decreased long term debt levels 
our total long term debt was lower than the prior year throughout fiscal due to the receipt of proceeds from the sale of our kfc restaurants in may  increased cash generated from operations and reduced capital expenditures during fiscal we recognized gains on disposition of property  equipment and investments in joint ventures from continuing operations of million during fiscal  compared to gains on disposition of property and equipment of only  during fiscal the majority of the fiscal gain was the result of a sale of a joint venture baymont inn suites property  with the remainder of the gain arising from the sale of excess land at our grand geneva property to the developer of the timber ridge lodge project 
we reported income tax expense on continuing operations for fiscal of million  an increase of million over fiscal our effective tax rate for fiscal was compared to in fiscal as previously noted  the significantly lower effective tax rate during fiscal was the result of the favorable impact of federal and state historic tax credits 
net earnings during fiscal included after tax income from discontinued operations of million  or 
per share  and an after tax gain on the disposal of our discontinued restaurant operations of million  or 
per share a detailed discussion of this item is included in the discontinued operations section 
weighted average shares outstanding were million for fiscal and million for fiscal we adopted statement of financial standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective june  under sfas no 
 goodwill is no longer amortized but reviewed for impairment annually  or more frequently if certain indicators arise 
we completed the required transitional impairment test and deemed that no impairment loss was necessary 
any subsequent impairment losses will be reflected in our operating income in the income statement 
with the adoption of sfas no 
 we ceased amortization of goodwill with a book value of million as of june  the majority of this goodwill resulted from prior theatre acquisitions 
had amortization of goodwill not been recorded in fiscal  net earnings would have increased by approximately  net of taxes  and earnings per share would have increased by 
for the year 
current plans we incurred approximately million in aggregate capital expenditures during fiscal after averaging over million per year during the year period from fiscal through we entered this year with plans to spend up to to million  but delays on several projects and an intentional effort to reduce capital spending during this challenging economic environment resulted in the significantly reduced capital expenditures during the year 
we currently anticipate that our capital expenditures during fiscal may return to the to million range  but we will continue to monitor our operating results and economic conditions so that we can respond appropriately 
based upon current capital projects approved or pending  it is likely that we will incur a minimum of million of capital expenditures during fiscal our current strategic plans include the following goals and strategies o continuing to maximize the return on our significant recent investments in movie theatres through both revenue and cost improvements  while pursuing selective screen additions and opportunities for additional growth in our theatre and screen base 
our investment of over million in our theatre division in recent years  more than doubling our number of company owned movie theatre screens from at the end of fiscal to screens at the end of fiscal while adding stadium seating in approximately of our first run screens the highest percentage in the industry  has contributed to two straight years of record operating performance 
our operating plans include a continued emphasis on expanding ancillary revenues  with a particular focus on pre show advertising revenues  a rapidly growing source of income for our theatres 
our capital plan for fiscal anticipates screen addition projects that may ultimately add as many as new screens to existing locations  including two new large ultrascreens tm 
o continuing to define and build our baymont inns suites brand  with a goal to be the best in class in the mid price without food and beverage segment of the lodging industry 
we continue to believe that most of our limited service lodging division s anticipated future growth in earnings will ultimately come as a result of revenue growth at our company owned inns as the brand captures a greater share of its industry segment and from our emphasis on opening new franchised and joint venture baymont inns suites 
as of the end of fiscal  six new franchised properties  one joint venture and one company owned property were under development 
the joint venture location our first in the important california market and the majority of the new franchised properties are expected to open during fiscal the company owned property  our first urban baymont inn suites  is being built in downtown chicago  illinois and is expected to open sometime in fiscal as a result of the reduced demand for lodging and a constrained financing market for new hotel development  industry supply growth has also slowed considerably 
accordingly  we currently have significantly fewer new franchised inns in development than previously planned 
as industry conditions improve  we hope to increase the pace of our franchise growth 
by emphasizing franchising  we hope that the baymont brand will grow more rapidly  conserving our capital for other strategic purposes 
our current plans could also include exploring additional growth of the baymont brand through potential joint venture investments  focusing on selected key strategic urban and suburban markets 
o maximizing the return on our significant recent investments in hotel projects and doubling the number of rooms either managed or owned by our hotels and resorts division to  rooms over the next three to five years 
many of our recent growth opportunities for our hotels and resorts division marcus vacation club  hilton madison  hotel phillips  timber ridge lodge and hilton milwaukee improvements required a lengthy development period during which significant capital was committed just prior to a period of time post september that has been generally regarded as one of the most difficult periods ever experienced by the hotel industry 
despite this challenging environment  our hotels and resorts division reported significant improvement in fiscal  and we expect these recent development projects  plus anticipated improvement at our core properties as business travel improves  to provide continued earnings growth opportunities during fiscal and beyond 
we expect that the majority of our anticipated potential growth in rooms managed will come from management contracts for other owners 
in some cases  we may own a partial interest in the new managed properties 
we continue to pursue a strategy that would involve the use of third party equity funds to invest in existing hotel properties 
under this strategy  we would make limited equity investments and would enter into management contracts to manage the properties for the equity funds 
the actual number  mix and timing of potential future new facilities and expansions will depend in large part on industry and economic conditions  our financial performance and available capital  the competitive environment  evolving customer needs and trends  our ability to increase the number of franchised baymont locations at a pace consistent with our current plans and the availability of attractive opportunities 
it is likely that our growth goals will continue to evolve and change in response to these and other factors  and there can be no assurance that these current goals will be achieved 
the terrorist attacks of september  and the subsequent war on terrorism  combined with the economic downturn  have had an unprecedented impact on the travel and lodging industry 
we are unable to predict with certainty if or when lodging demand  particularly from the business traveler  will return to pre september levels 
although we are encouraged by recent signs that business travel is beginning to increase  we believe that it is likely that the travel and lodging industries will continue to be negatively impacted to some degree by reduced business travel during some or all of fiscal any additional domestic terrorist attacks may have a similar or worse effect on the lodging industry than that experienced as a result of the september attacks 
theatres our oldest and largest division is our theatre division 
the theatre division contributed of our consolidated revenues and of our consolidated operating income  excluding corporate items  during fiscal the theatre division operates motion picture theatres in wisconsin  illinois  ohio and minnesota  and a family entertainment center in wisconsin

we opened three new screens  including our third ultrascreen tm  at a theatre in appleton  wisconsin during fiscal  generating  of additional revenues during the year 
we closed one theatre with five screens during fiscal closing that theatre and five other theatres during fiscal negatively impacted comparisons of this year s theatre division revenues to prior year results by million  although our screen closings had a minimal impact on operating income 
revenues for the theatre business and the motion picture industry in general are heavily dependent on the general audience appeal of available films  together with studio marketing  advertising and support campaigns  factors over which we have no control 
this was particularly evident during fiscal total theatre attendance at our comparable locations was up nearly after the first three quarters of the fiscal year  driven by a very good summer and an outstanding holiday season that included two consecutive record box office weeks for our theatre division 
this attendance increase was offset during the fourth quarter 
total theatre attendance decreased during fiscal compared to the prior year and attendance at our comparable locations decreased 
with no significant change in the number of competitive theatre screens in our markets  the primary factor contributing to the slight decrease in attendance during fiscal was the quality and quantity of film product released during the fourth quarter compared to the films that generated record performance during the fourth quarter last year 
we believe attendance during the fourth quarter was further impacted by the fact that easter a time period which historically has higher theatre attendance was three weeks later than the prior year  effectively shortening the spring film release season 
in addition  we believe that television coverage of the war in iraq also had a negative impact on theatre attendance 
despite the factors noted above  fiscal still was a record year at the box office for our theatre division 
contributing to our improved results was a increase in our average ticket price during fiscal compared to the prior year 
the entire increase in average ticket price occurred at our first run theatres 
as of may   we operated first run screens and budget screens 
compared to first run theatres  budget theatres generally have lower box office revenues and associated film costs  but higher concession sales as a percentage of box office revenue 
in a year of multiple blockbusters  our top performing films accounted for of our total box office receipts  compared to during fiscal three fiscal films produced box office receipts in excess of million 
the following eight fiscal films produced box office receipts in excess of million lord of the rings two towers  harry potter and the chamber of secrets  my big fat greek wedding  signs  austin powers in goldmember  matrix reloaded  chicago and catch me if you can 
we played films at our theatres during fiscal compared to during fiscal included in the total films played were four and two new imax r films during each fiscal year  respectively 
our average concession sales per person increased during fiscal compared to the prior year 
average concession sales per person are impacted by changes in concession pricing  types of films played and changes in our geographic mix of theatre locations 
on average  films that appeal to families and teenagers generally produce better than average concession sales compared to more adult orientated film product 
our theatre division s operating margin increased to during fiscal  compared to in fiscal contributing to the improved fiscal operating margin was reduced concession and advertising costs and reduced fixed occupancy costs as a percentage of revenues  partially offset by slightly higher film rental costs 
increases in other revenues  which include management fees and pre show advertising income  also contributed to our improved operating margin 
we expect these ancillary revenues to continue to increase during fiscal if box office and concession revenues continue to improve as they have in recent years  we anticipate that the expected improvements in other revenues and other various cost controls may be enough to offset anticipated increases in utility and health insurance costs  potentially resulting in continued improvement in our theatre division operating margins 
we continue to use technology to further enhance our operating results 
during fiscal  the number of tickets sold over the internet increased by 
in addition  we introduced a new stored value entertainment card during fiscal that contributed to a nearly increase in gift certificate sales for the year 
both of these programs are designed to differentiate our theatres from competing theatres and increase customer loyalty 
we entered into our second management agreement contract during fiscal  a new six screen theatre in tomah  wisconsin that is being developed by the ho chunk nation 
this theatre is expected to open in time for the fiscal holiday season 
during fiscal and beyond  we expect to make additional selected investments in new screens at existing strategic locations 
a four screen addition is currently under construction at an existing theatre in menomonee falls  wisconsin and up to additional screens are in the early stages of development 
we have also identified approximately six to eight theatres with up to screens that we may close over the next three years with minimal impact on operating results 
we believe that our long term competitive position has been strengthened as a result of our significant capital investments over the past few years 
although it is difficult to predict future box office performance  film product for the remainder of calendar appears stable  with the first half of the summer performing at a pace similar to last year and much anticipated sequels to the matrix and lord of the rings due to be released later in fiscal versus fiscal the significant increase in theatre division revenues during fiscal compared to the prior year occurred despite the fact that fiscal results included an additional week of operations 
the additional week of operations included in the theatre division s fiscal results contributed million to total theatre division revenues 
seventeen new screens added to five existing theatres during fiscal also contributed to the revenue increase during fiscal no new screens were added during fiscal the new screens added during fiscal generated additional revenues of  to fiscal revenues compared to fiscal five theatres with a total of screens were closed during fiscal  negatively impacting that year s theatre division revenues by million with minimal impact on operating income 
one theatre with a total of six screens was closed during fiscal in addition  a four screen theatre in stevens point  wisconsin was sold and a five screen theatre in wausau  wisconsin was purchased during fiscal these transactions had minimal impact on operations in fiscal total theatre attendance increased during fiscal compared to the prior year and attendance at our comparable locations increased 
while additional competitive theatre screens in several of our markets had some negative impact on our attendance during fiscal  the primary factor contributing to the increase in attendance was the quality and quantity of film product during the year 
fiscal was a record year at the box office both nationally and for our theatre division 
our top performing films accounted for of our total box office receipts  compared to for our top films during fiscal four fiscal films produced box office receipts in excess of million 
surprisingly  not one of our top eight performing films during fiscal was a summer movie  a time during which blockbuster films are often showcased 
the following fiscal films produced box office receipts in excess of million harry potter and the sorcerer s stone  lord of the rings  monsters  inc  spider man  star wars ii attack of the clones  ice age  a beautiful mind  ocean s eleven  rush hour and jurassic park only five films topped the million level for box office receipts during fiscal we played and films at our theatres during fiscal years and  respectively 
included in the total films played were two and six new imax r films during each fiscal year  respectively 
our average ticket price increased during fiscal compared to the prior year 
ticket prices were increased during the fiscal year in order to reflect the significant investments in stadium seating and digital sound that have been made in the majority of our theatres 
first run theatre average ticket prices increased during fiscal compared to the prior year 
our average concession sales per person increased during fiscal year many of the top films during fiscal were excellent family fare  which traditionally produce better than average concession sales 
our theatre division s operating margin increased to during fiscal  compared to in fiscal contributing to the improved fiscal operating margin were increased concession revenues  reduced utility and snow removal costs and reduced advertising costs 
the fiscal operating margin was lower than fiscal despite the additional week of operations included in the theatre division s fiscal results  which contributed approximately million to fiscal operating income 
fiscal operating margins were impacted by disappointing film product  high utility and snow removal costs and increased occupancy expenses associated with recent capital investments 
fiscal operating results also included a million before tax impairment charge related to the write down of the value of our imax r related assets in conjunction with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we entered the theatre management contract business by signing an agreement to manage screens at three chicago locations for another owner 
due to the timing of this transaction  the management contract had minimal impact on fiscal operating results 
limited service lodging our second largest division is the limited service lodging division  which contributed of our consolidated revenues and of our consolidated operating income  excluding corporate items  during fiscal the division s business consists of owning and franchising baymont inns suites and woodfield suites  which respectively operate in the segments of the lodging industry designated as limited service mid price without food and beverage and limited service all suites 
we also own and operate one budgetel inn

our adr for fiscal was just over  which is approximately lower than our specific set of competitors for the same time period  according to data received from outside industry resources  such as smith travel research 
the result of the occupancy increase and adr decline was a increase in baymont inns suites revenue per available room  or revpar  for comparable inns for fiscal revpar for comparable woodfield suites decreased during fiscal compared to the prior fiscal year 
we continue to operate in a very challenging environment for lodging  with business travel remaining below historic levels 
fiscal results were further impacted by the uncertainty related to the war with iraq and the uncertain timing of an economic recovery 
these factors further dampened room demand and created significant pricing pressure on existing hotels 
our overall increase in baymont inns suites revpar during fiscal continued to be better than the results of the majority of the properties in the limited service  mid price segment of the lodging industry 
data received from smith travel research indicates that our company owned or operated baymont inns suites realized gains in market share for all four quarters of fiscal our fiscal revpar increase of compares very favorably to a reported decrease of for the mid price without food and beverage segment of the lodging industry and decrease for our specific set of competitors for the same period 
we believe that our continued sales and marketing efforts to increase brand awareness  including more effectively utilizing all channels of distribution  have resulted in introducing our brand and facilities to many new customers and differentiating it from our competitors  contributing to the improved revenue performance relative to others in our industry 
in general  we believe that limited service lodging properties performed better over the last year than their full service counterparts as a result of travelers trading down from higher priced hotels 
we also believe that baymont  in particular  may be benefiting from the fact that it derives a significant portion of its occupancy from the over the road traveler and the majority of its inns are not in urban and destination resort locations  which have been most severely impacted by the aftermath of september and the subsequent economic downturn 
woodfield suites  which operates at a higher price point than baymont inns suites and whose results are very dependent upon the mid week business traveler  has been impacted more by the current environment  consistent with others in its industry segment 
our limited service lodging division s operating income and operating margin decreased during fiscal compared to the prior year due to several factors 
reduced operating income from our woodfield suites and our baymont franchise operations contributed to the decline 
in addition  increases to our advertising  utility and insurance costs continued to put pressure on our operating margin 
the fact that our revenue increases were the result of increased occupancy rather than our rates also contributed to our lower operating margin  as payroll costs necessary to service the additional occupancy increased 
comparisons of fiscal results to fiscal were also negatively impacted by the fact that last year  our property in salt lake city  utah reported incremental operating profits of approximately  as a result of the winter olympics 
our ability to overcome anticipated increases in insurance  health and utility costs during fiscal and increase our operating margin will likely be dependent upon a continued improvement in the economy in general and business travel in particular  resulting in increased room demand and reduced pricing pressure 
although the near term outlook for the industry and baymont in particular is uncertain given the current economic climate  we continue to believe that our long term strategy to build our baymont brand should result in increased revpar in the future 
the significantly reduced supply growth throughout the industry  while slowing our franchising growth  should also favorably impact the operating results of our existing hotels as an economic recovery occurs 
our current strategies for this division continue to focus on increasing occupancy and brand awareness at our baymont inns suites 
our frequent stay program  guest ovations tm  contributed approximately of our revenues during fiscal compared to during fiscal room nights booked through our reservation center were nearly ahead of last year 
during fiscal  we further enhanced our reservation technology by introducing full two way connectivity between the reservation center and the individual properties  increasing our ability to offer all available rooms over every available sales channel  including our rapidly growing internet and travel agent sales 
in addition  our new ovations rooms continue to be well received by our guests and we continue to update the exterior of many of our company owned baymonts with a fresh  new exterior renovation package that has typically resulted in improved operating performance at our older locations 
as a result of all of these efforts  subject to economic and industry conditions  we believe that we can successfully position the baymont brand to capture additional market share and increase our revpar and profitability in the future 
three franchised baymont inns suites were opened during fiscal one company owned baymont was sold during fiscal and eight franchised locations left the system 
fiscal revenues were negatively impacted by  compared to fiscal as a result of the sale of the company owned property 
as we have previously disclosed  we had identified additional baymont inns suites that were to be considered for sale to new and existing franchisees 
however  due to a difficult financing environment for potential franchisees and an overall downturn in the property sales market  we have deferred this strategy and will reevaluate our options regarding these properties at a later date 
fiscal versus fiscal the additional week of operations included in our limited service lodging division s fiscal results contributed million to total fiscal revenues  negatively impacting fiscal comparisons to prior year revenues 
baymont s occupancy percentage decreased percentage points during fiscal and the adr at comparable baymont inns suites decreased compared to the prior year 
our adr for fiscal was just over the result of the occupancy and adr declines was a decrease in baymont inns suites revpar for comparable inns for fiscal revpar for comparable woodfield suites decreased during fiscal compared to the prior fiscal year 
the primary factor contributing to the declines in our occupancy and revpar was reduced business travel  as companies reacted to the slowing economic environment 
this trend dramatically accelerated as a result of the events of september our adr  which had increased dramatically over the prior two years in conjunction with our repositioning of the baymont inns suites brand from the lower priced economy segment of the lodging industry to the mid price segment  declined as a result of competitive pressures from the significantly reduced room demand 
the performance of our baymont inns suites during fiscal tracked fairly consistently with the results of the majority of the properties in this limited service  mid priced lodging industry segment 
industry wide occupancy rates were generally declining prior to september as a result of the then slowing economy 
in the first full week after september  industry wide occupancy rates for the mid scale without food and beverage segment declined by approximately compared to the same period in the previous year 
industry and baymont occupancy rates improved considerably in the subsequent months  but our revpar declines remained at during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal as indicated earlier  an overall reduction in business travel as a result of the economic environment continued to be the primary reason for the reduced occupancies 
we responded by focusing on reducing our costs  reducing operational payroll and corporate overhead and restructuring our operational management and supervisory teams 
the majority of the division s decrease in operating income during fiscal occurred during september and october  when occupancy declines were greatest and cost control measures had not been fully implemented 
in fact  the division s operating income during the second half of fiscal was substantially better than the same period in the previous year  despite the additional week of operations reported in our fiscal results 
the additional week of operations included in the limited service lodging division s fiscal results contributed approximately million to fiscal operating income 
in addition to the various cost control measures and reduced utility costs described earlier  the division s operating results during the second half of fiscal compared to fiscal were favorably impacted by the fact that we incurred approximately million in one time costs during fiscal related to our introduction of our new guest ovations tm frequent stay reward program  the development of new interior design packages and the implementation of a new systemwide training program 
increased franchise revenues also helped to offset the reduced income from company owned properties 
no company owned properties were opened during fiscal two baymont inn suites opened or acquired during fiscal contributed additional revenues of million during fiscal with nominal operating income  compared to the prior year 
one joint venture baymont inn suites managed by us was sold to a franchisee during fiscal our share of the gain on sale was million 
we sold one baymont inn suites to a franchisee during fiscal  negatively impacting fiscal revenues by  compared to fiscal the division outsourced its reservation center during the second quarter of fiscal our reservations from the central reservation center increased over during the second half of fiscal  compared to the same period in the prior year 
at the beginning of the fiscal fourth quarter  we introduced and began marketing our new ovations rooms  which feature additional amenities not normally found in the limited service lodging sector  including pillow top mattresses  down lite tm pillows and complimentary in room bottled water  an industry first 
hotels and resorts the hotels and resorts division contributed of our consolidated revenues and of our consolidated operating income  excluding corporate items  during fiscal the hotels and resorts division owns and operates two full service hotels in downtown milwaukee  wisconsin  a full facility destination resort in lake geneva  wisconsin  a boutique luxury resort in indian wells  california  and full service hotels in madison  wisconsin  and downtown kansas city  missouri 
in addition  we managed five hotels during fiscal  four hotels during fiscal and three hotels during fiscal for other owners 
we also manage a vacation ownership development in lake geneva  wisconsin

in millions  except percentages revenues operating income operating margin available rooms at fiscal year end company owned    management contracts   total available rooms    fiscal versus fiscal division revenues and operating income increased during fiscal compared to the prior year due to the added revenues from our newest hotels the hotel phillips in kansas city  missouri  the hilton madison at monona terrace and our timber ridge lodge management contract and improved results from our two milwaukee hotels 
in addition  last year s results included the very difficult weeks and months immediately following september   resulting in favorable comparisons benefiting fiscal fiscal comparisons to the prior year were also favorably impacted by the fact that the division s fiscal operating results included approximately million of pre opening expenses related to the hotel phillips and timber ridge lodge 
as noted in our limited service lodging discussion  it continues to be a very challenging environment for hotels  particularly those operating in the upscale segments of the industry 
several of our hotels and resorts derive a significant portion of their revenues from corporate group business and individual business travel  both of which continue to be below historical levels and in some cases  even below last year s levels 
our hotels and resorts have generally performed at or better than others in our segment of the industry  likely due at least partially to our property and location mix 
excluding the hotel phillips  which opened during the second quarter last year  the division s total revpar for comparable company owned properties during fiscal decreased compared to the prior year 
the slight decrease in revpar compared to the same period last year was the result of the net effect of slightly decreased occupancy and an overall increase in adr for these comparable properties 
we have attempted to retain the integrity of our rate structure during a period when others in the industry are heavily discounting  believing that this strategy is in our best long term interest 
the near term outlook for the future performance of this division remains uncertain  but we are encouraged by recent trends 
while we still anticipate some residual negative impact on the revenues of our hotels and resorts division during fiscal as a result of the reduced business travel  the summer season has started off stronger than last year and advance bookings for the remainder of the summer and into the fall also appear stronger 
we also anticipate that the performance of our newest hotels will continue to improve 
as a result  with cost controls remaining a high priority  subject to economic conditions  we expect our operating margins to continue to improve in this division during fiscal we also continue to maintain our properties consistent with our traditional high standards  making the investments necessary to improve operating results in the future 
major room renovations were completed at two of our premier properties  the pfister and grand geneva  and a new parking structure at the hilton milwaukee city center was opened during the first quarter of fiscal plans are currently underway to develop a new spa at our miramonte resort in time for the peak winter season 
the plans include converting an existing guest building into a full service spa with several signature treatments designed to distinguish it from other spas in the competitive desert market 
during fiscal  we sold out all available ownership units of our first three buildings at our vacation ownership development at the grand geneva resort spa and completed construction on a new building that includes new units  doubling the size of the existing development 
timeshare sales totaled million during fiscal compared to million during the prior year and operating income from this business was unchanged 
we expect our operating performance from this development to improve during fiscal as we sell into this new building 
fiscal versus fiscal the additional week of operations included in the hotels and resorts division s fiscal results contributed approximately million to fiscal revenues and approximately  to fiscal operating income 
division revenues increased during fiscal due to the added revenues from our newly opened hotels  the hotel phillips and the hilton madison at monona terrace  in addition to revenues from our management of the timber ridge lodge 
our hotels and resorts division operating income during fiscal declined compared to the prior year entirely as a result of the september terrorist attacks  challenging economic environment and resulting reduced business travel 
operating margins were further negatively impacted during fiscal and by million and million  respectively  in pre opening expenses related to our new hotel projects 
the events of september  and the ensuing further economic downturn had a significant negative impact on the operating results of our hotels and resorts division during the second quarter of fiscal september through november 
in fact  our entire decrease in fiscal hotels and resorts division operating income compared to the prior year occurred during the second quarter 
historically  higher priced upscale hotels have always experienced more challenges during difficult economic environments than lower priced  limited service properties 
the negative impact on this division was most severe during september and october  when a significant number of group cancellations occurred 
according to data from smith travel research  during the first full week after september  industry wide occupancy rates for upper upscale hotels dropped approximately and revpar declined over compared to the same period during the prior year 
similar to limited service lodging  results in this industry segment subsequently improved during the remainder of fiscal  but did not approach pre september levels 
our hotels and resorts outperformed the industry during this time period  we believe due at least partially to our particular property mix 
our properties are generally located in mid size cities and resort areas within driving distance from major midwest population centers  which were not affected as significantly by the downturn as major east and west coast destinations 
excluding the recently opened hotel phillips and hilton madison at monona terrace  the division s total revpar for comparable company owned properties decreased during fiscal compared to the prior year 
this total included a decrease in revpar during the second quarter of fiscal alone 
the entire decrease in revpar during fiscal was the result of reduced occupancies  as our division wide adr actually increased slightly during the year 
our response to the economic circumstances focused on controlling costs and  as a result  we reported slightly improved operating losses during the second half of fiscal despite the reduction in revpar and the extra week of operations included in fiscal a skywalk to milwaukee s new midwest airlines convention center and a new restaurant were added to the hilton milwaukee city center during fiscal the division s new hilton madison at monona terrace  a room hotel connected by skywalk to the monona terrace convention center in madison  wisconsin opened during the fourth quarter of fiscal taking the events of september and resulting economic downturn into account  we were very pleased with the operating performance of this property during its first year 
the newly renovated hotel phillips had the unfortunate timing of reopening on september  and thus got off to a slower than anticipated start 
we also began management in july of the timber ridge lodge  a condominium hotel project adjacent to the grand geneva resort spa in lake geneva  wisconsin and began management of a new hilton garden inn in houston  texas in may during fiscal  our vacation ownership development at the grand geneva resort spa contributed revenues of million and negatively impacted operating income by approximately  the weakened economy during fiscal contributed to a slight reduction in timeshare sales to million  but reduced sales and marketing expenses contributed to a  improvement in operating income from this business during fiscal discontinued operations on may   we sold our kfc and kfc taco bell in restaurants 
we realized a net before tax gain of million million after tax during fiscal as a result of the sale 
the asset purchase agreement with the buyer provided for a potential additional future purchase price payment if certain performance conditions were met 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the buyer elected to terminate this provision of the agreement by paying us an additional million of proceeds 
as a result  an additional gain on sale of discontinued operations  net of tax  of approximately million or 
per share is included in the reported results for fiscal prior to the sale  we had non exclusive franchise rights to operate kfc restaurants in the milwaukee metropolitan area and in northeast wisconsin 
we operated kfc restaurants and three kfc taco bell in restaurants during fiscal year  reporting revenues of million and operating income of million 
financial condition liquidity and capital resources our lodging and movie theatre businesses each generate significant and relatively consistent daily amounts of cash because each segment s revenue is derived predominantly from consumer cash purchases 
we believe that these relatively consistent and predictable cash sources  together with the availability of million of unused credit lines at fiscal year end  should be adequate to support the ongoing operational liquidity needs of our businesses 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we allowed a million  day revolving credit agreement with several banks to expire due to the significant amount of other available credit lines 
our existing five year  million credit facility with several banks and our million term note with one of the banks are both scheduled to expire in it is our intention to extend the maturity dates of these credit agreements during fiscal and we do not believe that we will have any difficulty doing so at continued favorable terms 
as of may   we classified million of outstanding borrowings under the term note and under commercial paper agreements backed by unused credit lines as current  pending new agreements 
we expect these borrowings to be reclassified to long term debt upon execution of the new agreements 
we continue to believe that it is appropriate to have a significant portion of our outstanding debt with longer maturities and fixed interest rates  due to the significant real estate component of our total assets 
net cash provided by operating activities decreased by million  or  to million during fiscal  compared to million during fiscal the decrease was primarily the result of decreased earnings from continuing operations and an increase in real estate and development costs 
net cash used in investing activities during fiscal decreased by million  or  to million 
the reduction in net cash used in investing activities was primarily the result of reduced capital expenditures and increased net proceeds from disposals of property  equipment and other assets 
cash proceeds from the disposals of property  equipment and other assets totaled million and million during fiscal and  respectively 
the cash proceeds received during fiscal were primarily the result of the sale of a former theatre location  one company owned baymont inn  several former restaurant locations  excess parcels of land and the additional payment received on the sale of our kfc restaurants 
the cash proceeds received during fiscal were primarily the result of the sale of several parcels of land 
total capital expenditures including normal continuing capital maintenance projects of million and million were incurred in fiscal and  respectively 
capital expenditures during fiscal included million incurred in the hotels and resorts division  including the construction of a new parking garage at the hilton milwaukee city center and room renovations at the grand geneva resort spa and pfister hotel 
in addition  capital expenditures of million were incurred in the limited service lodging division  including several exterior renovations and construction at the downtown chicago baymont project 
also  capital expenditures of million were incurred by the theatre division to fund the three screen addition to the appleton  wisconsin theatre and ongoing maintenance capital projects 
we have not altered our maintenance capital expenditure plans as a result of the current economic environment  but we did delay the start of some non critical capital projects  many of which are now scheduled for completion during fiscal during fiscal  million was incurred for hotels and resorts division projects  million for limited service lodging division projects and million for theatre division projects 
total capital expenditures in fiscal are currently expected to be as high as to million and are expected to be funded by cash generated from operations  net proceeds from the disposal of selected assets and project related borrowings 
the only new company owned location currently committed to in the fiscal capital expenditure plan is the baymont inn suites being constructed in downtown chicago 
the remaining capital is expected to be divided fairly evenly across all three divisions and will include selected theatre screen additions  potential strategic equity investments in hotel or limited service lodging projects  and maintenance and project capital 
principally as a result of our reduced capital spending during fiscal  our total debt decreased to million at the close of fiscal  compared to million at the end of fiscal net cash used in financing activities in fiscal totaled million  compared to million in fiscal during fiscal  we received only  of net proceeds from the issuance of notes payable and long term debt  compared to million during fiscal the fiscal proceeds were from the issuance of senior unsecured notes 
we made total principal payments on notes payable and long term debt of million during fiscal  representing the payment of current maturities and payment of borrowings on commercial paper and revolving credit facilities with the excess operating cash flow available as a result of the reduced capital spending 
total principal payments totaled million during fiscal and included the payment of current maturities and payment of borrowings on commercial paper and revolving credit facilities with the proceeds of the senior notes 
our debt capitalization ratio was at may   compared to at the prior fiscal year end 
based upon our current expectations for fiscal capital expenditure levels and potential asset sales proceeds  we do not anticipate our long term debt total or debt capitalization ratio to change significantly during fiscal during fiscal  we repurchased  of our common shares for approximately  in conjunction with the exercise of stock options  compared to  of common shares repurchased for approximately  during fiscal our board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to million shares of our outstanding common stock 
as of may   approximately million shares remained available under this authorization for repurchase 
any such repurchases are expected to be executed on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions depending upon a number of factors  including prevailing market conditions 
contractual obligations we have obligations and commitments to make future payments under debt and operating leases 
the following schedule details these obligations at may  in thousands payments due by period less than after total year years years years long term debt      operating lease obligations      total contractual obligations      included in our long term debt totals are commercial paper borrowings issued through agreements with two banks 
we have included these borrowings with long term debt because we have the ability and intent to replace the borrowings with long term borrowings under our credit lines 
we have classified million of outstanding commercial paper borrowings and a million of term note borrowing as due in less than one year because our current revolving credit agreement and related term note currently expire late in fiscal we anticipate executing new agreements during fiscal that will effectively extend the maturity dates of these borrowings 
additional detail describing our long term debt is included in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we guarantee debt of our unconsolidated joint ventures and other entities 
our joint venture partners also guarantee all or a portion of this same debt

variable interest rate debt outstanding as of may  was million  carried an average interest rate of  and represented of our total debt portfolio 
our earnings are affected by changes in short term interest rates as a result of our borrowings under our revolving credit agreements  floating rate mortgages  industrial development revenue bonds and unsecured term notes 
fixed interest rate debt totaled million as of may   carried an average interest rate of and represented of our total debt portfolio 
fixed interest rate debt included the following senior notes bearing interest monthly at  maturing in  senior notes which bear interest semiannually at fixed rates ranging from to  maturing in through  fixed rate mortgages  industrial development revenue bonds and other debt instruments bearing interest from to  maturing in through  and an unsecured term note with a stated rate of  maturing in the fair value of our long term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair market value of our fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
the fair value of our million of senior notes is approximately million 
based upon the respective rates and prepayment provisions of our remaining fixed interest rate senior notes and mortgages at may   the carrying amounts of such debt approximates fair value 
the variable interest rate debt and fixed interest rate debt outstanding as of may  matures as follows in thousands thereafter total variable interest rate   fixed interest rate        total debt        we periodically enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate changes 
the swaps involve the exchange of fixed and variable interest rate payments without exchanging the notional principal amount 
payments or receipts on the agreements are recorded as adjustments to interest expense 
we had no outstanding interest rate swap agreements at may  on may   we terminated a swap agreement that had effectively converted million of our borrowings under revolving credit agreements from floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis 
the fair value of the swap on the date of the termination was a liability of million 
the remaining loss in other comprehensive income at may  of million  net of tax will be reclassified into earnings as interest expense through november   the remaining life of the original hedge  as interest payments affect earnings 
we expect to reclassify approximately   net of tax of loss into earnings during fiscal critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  insurance reserves  carrying value of investments in long lived assets  intangible assets  income taxes  pensions  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
o we review long lived assets  including fixed assets  goodwill  investments in joint ventures and receivables from joint ventures  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such asset may not be recoverable 
in assessing the recoverability of these assets  we must make assumptions regarding the estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
the estimate of cash flow is based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance 
our estimates of undiscounted cash flow may differ from actual cash flow due to factors such as economic conditions  changes to our business model or changes in our operating performance 
if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows excluding interest is less than the carrying value  we recognize an impairment loss  measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
during fiscal  we recorded a before tax reserve for bad debts on receivables from joint ventures of million and a before tax impairment charge of  on investments in joint ventures 
during fiscal  we recorded a before tax impairment charge of million related to our two imax r theatre screens 
o we sponsor an unfunded nonqualified defined benefit pension plan covering certain employees who meet eligibility requirements 
several statistical and other factors which attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans 
these factors include assumptions about the discount rate and rate of future compensation increases as determined by us  within certain guidelines 
in addition  our actuarial consultants also use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate these factors 
the actuarial assumptions used by us may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences may impact the amount of pension expense recorded by us 
o we maintain insurance coverage for workers compensation and general liability claims utilizing a retroactive insurance policy 
under this policy  we are responsible for all claims up to our stop loss limitation of  it is not uncommon for insurance claims of this type to be filed months or even years after the initial incident may have occurred 
it also can take many months or years before some claims are settled 
as a result  we must estimate our potential self insurance liability based upon several factors  including historical trends  our knowledge of the individual claims and likelihood of success  and our insurance carrier s judgment regarding the reserves necessary for individual claims 
actual claim settlements may differ from our estimates 
o we offer health insurance coverage to our associates under a variety of different fully insured hmo s and self insured fee for service plans 
under the fee for service plans  we are responsible for all claims up to our stop loss limitation of  our health insurance plans are set up on a calendar year basis 
as a result  we must estimate our potential health self insurance liability based upon several factors  including historical trends  our knowledge of the potential impact of changes in plan structure and our judgment regarding the portion of the total cost of claims that will be shared with associates 
actual differences in any of these factors may impact the amount of health insurance expense recorded by us
