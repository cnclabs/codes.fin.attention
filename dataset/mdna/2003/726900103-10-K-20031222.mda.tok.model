critical accounting policies and estimates this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  inventories  warranty obligations  intangible asset valuation and income taxes 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies and the related judgments and estimates affect the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
the company s policy is to recognize revenue for product sales when title transfer and risk of loss has passed to the customer  which is generally upon shipment of our products to our customers 
the company defers and recognizes service revenue over the contractual period or as services are rendered 
the company estimates expected sales returns and records the amount as a reduction of revenue at the time of shipment 
the company s policies comply with the guidance provided by staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  issued by the securities and exchange commission 
judgments are required in evaluating the credit worthiness of our customers 
credit is not extended to customers and revenue is not recognized until the company has determined that the risk of uncollectibility is minimal 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company s policy is to maintain allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
credit limits are established through a process of reviewing the financial history and stability of each customer 
where appropriate  the company obtains credit rating reports and financial statements of the customer when determining or modifying their credit limits 
the company regularly evaluates the collectibility of its trade receivable balances based on a combination of factors 
when a customer s account balance becomes past due  the company initiates dialogue with the customer to determine the cause 
if it is determined that the customer will be unable to meet its financial obligation to the company  such as in the case of a bankruptcy filing  deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position or other material events impacting their business  the company records a specific allowance to reduce the related receivable to the amount the company expects to recover 
the company also records an allowance for all customers based on certain other factors including the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience with customers 
the company believes its reported allowances are adequate 
if the financial conditions of those customers were to deteriorate  however  resulting in their inability to make payments  the company may need to record additional allowances which would result in additional general and administrative expenses being recorded for the period in which such determination was made 
inventory reserves 
the company is exposed to a number of economic and industry factors that could result in portions of its inventory becoming either obsolete or in excess of anticipated usage  or subject to lower of cost or market issues 
these factors include  but are not limited to  technological changes in the company s markets  the company s ability to meet changing customer requirements  competitive pressures in products and prices  and the availability of key components from the company s suppliers 
the company s policy is to establish inventory reserves when conditions exist that suggest that its inventory may be in excess of anticipated demand or is obsolete based upon its assumptions about future demand for its products and market conditions 
the company regularly evaluates its ability to realize the value of its inventory based on a combination of factors including the following historical usage rates  forecasted sales or usage  product end of life dates  estimated current and future market values and new product introductions 
purchasing practices and alternative usage avenues are explored within these processes to mitigate inventory exposure 
when recorded  the company s reserves are intended to reduce the carrying value of its inventory to its net realizable value 
if actual demand for the company s products deteriorates  or market conditions are less favorable than those that the company projects  additional inventory reserves may be required 
product warranties 
the company s products are sold with warranty provisions that require it to remedy deficiencies in quality or performance of our products over a specified period of time  generally between and months  at no cost to the company s customers 
the company s policy is to establish warranty reserves at levels that represent its estimate of the costs that will be incurred to fulfill those warranty requirements at the time that revenue is recognized 
the company believe that its recorded liabilities are adequate to cover its future cost of materials  labor and overhead for the servicing of its products sold through that date 
if actual product failures  or material or service delivery costs differ from the company s estimates  its warranty liability would need to be revised accordingly 
intangible assets 
the company adopted the financial accounting standards board fasb statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets on accounting for business combinations and goodwill as of the beginning of fiscal year accordingly  the company no longer amortizes goodwill from acquisitions  but continues to amortize other acquisition related intangibles and costs 
as required by these rules  the company will perform an impairment review annually  or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist 
this annual impairment review was completed during the second quarter of fiscal year  and no impairment was found 
the impairment review is based on a discounted cash flow approach that uses estimates of future market share and revenues and costs for the company s segments as well as appropriate discount rates 
the estimates used are consistent with the plans and estimates that the company uses to manage the underlying businesses 
however  if the company fails to deliver new products for these groups  if the products fail to gain expected market acceptance  or if market conditions in the related businesses are unfavorable  revenue and cost forecasts may not be achieved  and the company may incur charges for impairment of goodwill 
for identifiable intangible assets  the company amortizes the cost over the estimated useful life and assesses any impairment by estimating the future cash flow from the associated asset in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
if the estimated undiscounted cash flow related to these assets decreases in the future or the useful life is shorter than originally estimated  the company may incur charges for impairment of these assets 
the impairment is based on the estimated discounted cash flow associated with the asset 
an impairment could result if the underlying technology fails to gain market acceptance  the company fails to deliver new products related to these technology assets  the products fail to gain expected market acceptance or if market conditions in the related businesses are unfavorable 
income taxes 
in the past  the company has recorded a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
the company has assessed the valuation allowance based upon its estimate of future taxable income covering a relatively short time horizon given the volatility in the markets the company serves and its historic operating results 
the availability of tax planning strategies to utilize the company s recorded deferred tax assets is also considered 
if the company is able to realize the deferred tax assets in an amount in excess of its reported net amounts  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase earnings in the period such determination was made 
similarly  if the company should determine that the company may be unable to realize its net deferred tax assets to the extent reported  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made
