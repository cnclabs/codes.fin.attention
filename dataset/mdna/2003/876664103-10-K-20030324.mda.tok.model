item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a 
the shopping center business there are several types of retail shopping centers  varying primarily by size and marketing strategy 
retail shopping centers range from neighborhood centers of less than  square feet of gla to regional and super regional shopping centers 
retail shopping centers in excess of  square feet of gla are generally referred to as regional shopping centers  while those centers having in excess of  square feet of gla are generally referred to as super regional shopping centers 
nineteen of the centers are super regional centers 
in this annual report on form k  the term regional shopping centers refers to both regional and super regional shopping centers 
the term gla refers to gross retail space  including anchors and mall tenant areas  and the term mall gla refers to gross retail space  excluding anchors 
the term anchor refers to a department store or other large retail store 
the term mall tenants refers to stores other than anchors that are typically specialty retailers and lease space in shopping centers 
business of the company the company  as managing general partner of the operating partnership  is engaged in the ownership  management  leasing  acquisition  development  and expansion of regional shopping centers 
the centers o are strategically located in major metropolitan areas  many in communities that are among the most affluent in the country  including new york city  los angeles  san francisco  denver  detroit  phoenix  miami  dallas  tampa  orlando  and washington  dc  o range in size between  and million square feet of gla and between  and  square feet of mall gla 
the smallest center has approximately stores  and the largest has over stores 
of the centers  are super regional shopping centers  o have approximately  stores operated by its mall tenants under approximately  trade names  o have anchors  operating under trade names  o lease over of mall gla to national chains  including subsidiaries or divisions of the limited the limited  express  victoria s secret  and others  gap gap  gap kids  banana republic  and others  and foot locker  inc foot locker  lady foot locker  champs sports  and others  and o are among the most productive measured by mall tenants average per square foot sales in the united states 
in  mall tenants had average per square foot sales of  which is significantly greater than the average for all regional shopping centers owned by public companies 
the most important factor affecting the revenues generated by the centers is leasing to mall tenants primarily specialty retailers  which represents approximately of revenues 
anchors account for less than of revenues because many own their stores and  in general  those that lease their stores do so at rates substantially lower than those in effect for mall tenants 
the company s portfolio is concentrated in highly productive super regional shopping centers 
all centers had annual rent rolls at december  of over million 
the company believes that this level of productivity is indicative of the centers strong competitive position and is  in significant part  attributable to the company s business strategy and philosophy 
the company believes that large shopping centers including regional and especially super regional shopping centers are the least susceptible to direct competition because among other reasons anchors and large specialty retail stores do not find it economically attractive to open additional stores in the immediate vicinity of an existing location for fear of competing with themselves 
in addition to the advantage of size  the company believes that the centers success can be attributed in part to their other physical characteristics  such as design  layout  and amenities 
business strategy and philosophy the company believes that the regional shopping center business is not simply a real estate development business  but rather an operating business in which a retailing approach to the on going management and leasing of the centers is essential 
thus the company o offers a large  diverse selection of retail stores in each center to give customers a broad selection of consumer goods and variety of price ranges 
o endeavors to increase overall mall tenants sales by leasing space to a constantly changing mix of tenants  thereby increasing achievable rents 
o seeks to anticipate trends in the retailing industry and emphasizes ongoing introductions of new retail concepts into the centers 
due in part to this strategy  a number of successful retail trade names have opened their first mall stores in the centers 
in addition  the company has brought to the centers new to the market retailers 
the company believes that its execution of this leasing strategy has been unique in the industry and is an important element in building and maintaining customer loyalty and increasing mall productivity 
o provides innovative initiatives that utilize technology and the internet to heighten the shopping experience for customers  build customer loyalty and increase tenant sales 
one such initiative is the company s shoptaubman one to one marketing program  which connects shoppers and retailers through online websites 
approximately of the managed centers tenants participate in the center websites and at the end of  these sites had approximately thousand registered users 
the centers compete for retail consumer spending through diverse  in depth presentations of predominantly fashion merchandise in an environment intended to facilitate customer shopping 
while some centers include stores that target high end  upscale customers  each center is individually merchandised in light of the demographics of its potential customers within convenient driving distance 
the company s leasing strategy involves assembling a diverse mix of mall tenants in each of the centers in order to attract customers  thereby generating higher sales by mall tenants 
high sales by mall tenants make the centers attractive to prospective tenants  thereby increasing the rental rates that prospective tenants are willing to pay 
the company implements an active leasing strategy to increase the centers productivity and to set minimum rents at higher levels 
elements of this strategy include terminating leases of under performing tenants  renegotiating existing leases  and not leasing space to prospective tenants that though viable or attractive in certain ways would not enhance a center s retail mix 
potential for growth the company s principal objective is to enhance shareholder value 
the company seeks to maximize the financial results of its assets  while pursuing a growth strategy that concentrates primarily on an active new center development program 
internal growth in mid  the company underwent a major review of its business strategies  which highlighted that of the company s future growth will come from its existing core portfolio and business 
although the company has always had a culture of intensively managing its assets and maximizing the rents from tenants  the company committed to review all of the processes that impact the core portfolio in order to drive even better performance 
first  the company agreed upon the core business strategy  which is to maintain a portfolio of properties that deliver above market profitable growth by providing targeted retailers with the best opportunity to do business in each market and targeted shoppers with the best local shopping experience for their needs 
the company decided upon three endeavors that would lead to achievement of the key mission to deliver above market profitable growth 
the company s first endeavor is to become an even more customer centric company than it is today  which will enable the company to make better decisions driven by fact based understanding of what retailers and shoppers want 
the second endeavor is to become more operationally excellent  which will enable the company to achieve competitive cost efficiencies  greater discipline  and more timely processes and decision making 
this is especially important as the company s competitors search for economies of scale in increasingly larger operations 
the third endeavor is to achieve profitable growth  which the company has defined as maintaining the highest tenant sales and sales growth in the industry  and accelerating core net operating income noi growth over time 
the company believes further integrating these basic strategic themes throughout the organization will serve to coordinate and prioritize all of the company s efforts to achieve its strategy 
the company has identified the key drivers to achieve its core business strategy 
these drivers fall into four categories people drivers  organizational drivers  customer drivers and financial drivers 
the company identified drivers of the core business that served as a basis for seven companywide initiatives to be completed in that will establish a strong foundation for improved core performance 
these initiatives are each being led by teams of approximately to people from all areas of the organization 
o initiative one common area maintenance cam 
this team will focus on all of the company s cam processes to ensure that decision making is customer based  and as low cost and efficient as possible 
o initiative two customer knowledge 
this team will take a fresh look at how the company obtains and applies tenant and shopper research in all its decision making throughout the organization 
o initiative three credit grading 
this team will review the company s current tenant grading system and seek improvements to ensure that the system is a strong predictor of a tenant s ability to pay contract rent for its entire term and establish risk parameters for each asset to guide our leasing team 
o initiative four tenant optimization 
utilizing the enhanced credit grading system just described  this team will create upgraded and more formalized management tools 
these will help in making leasing decisions based on information that quantifies the tradeoffs between occupancy  rent  credit risk and merchandising to ensure the greatest shareholder value creation in each individual leasing condition 
o initiative five leasing and store opening process 
this team will complete the implementation of process improvements identified in that will reduce the time between a tenant leaving a space and a new tenant paying rent in that space 
this involves a new lease process software package that will be implemented by june and the establishment of enhanced metrics and goals to monitor improvement 
o initiative six leadership and technical competencies 
this team will update the key leadership and technical skills required at each level of the organization 
the company will then determine any gaps and create a plan to bridge these gaps by individual 
o initiative seven linkage of the core drivers to individual commitments 
this team will create a direct linkage of all core drivers to individual goals and commitments and ensure compensation plans are appropriately structured to provide associates incentives to improve the core 
the company strongly believes that focusing management attention on these initiatives will improve its performance on these drivers and by establishing specific benchmarks and goals for these drivers  which the company can measure year after year  the company will have set the stage for strong noi growth over the near to midterm 
development of new centers the company is pursuing an active program of regional shopping center development 
the company believes that it has the expertise to develop economically attractive regional shopping centers through intensive analysis of local retail opportunities 
the company believes that the development of new centers is an important use of its capital and an area in which the company excels 
at any time  the company has numerous potential development projects in various stages 
the mall at millenia  a million square foot super regional center located in orlando  florida opened on october  the center is anchored by neiman marcus  bloomingdale s  and macy s 
additionally  one new center is currently under construction  stony point fashion park  a thousand square foot center in richmond  virginia  is scheduled to open in september construction is scheduled to begin in on northlake mall  a million square foot center in charlotte  north carolina 
the center is scheduled to open in august the company s policies with respect to development activities are designed to reduce the risks associated with development 
for instance  the company previously entered into an agreement to lease a center while the company investigated the redevelopment opportunities of the center 
also  the company generally does not intend to acquire land early in the development process 
instead  the company generally acquires options on land or forms partnerships with landholders holding potentially attractive development sites 
the company typically exercises the options only once it is prepared to begin construction 
the pre construction phase for a regional center typically extends over several years and the time to obtain anchor commitments  zoning and regulatory approvals  and public financing arrangements can vary significantly from project to project 
in addition  the company does not intend to begin construction until a sufficient number of anchor stores have agreed to operate in the shopping center  such that the company is confident that the projected sales and rents from mall gla are sufficient to earn a return on invested capital in excess of the company s cost of capital 
having historically followed these principles  the company s experience indicates that  on average  less than of the costs of the development of a regional shopping center will be incurred prior to the construction period 
however  no assurance can be given that the company will continue to be able to so limit pre construction costs 
unexpected costs due to extended zoning and regulatory processes may cause the company s investment in a project to exceed this historic experience 
while the company will continue to evaluate development projects using criteria  including financial criteria for rates of return  similar to those employed in the past  no assurances can be given that the adherence to these policies will produce comparable results in the future 
in addition  the costs of shopping center development opportunities that are explored but ultimately abandoned will  to some extent  diminish the overall return on development projects see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources capital spending for further discussion of the company s development activities 
strategic acquisitions the company s objective is to acquire existing centers only when they are compatible with the quality of the company s portfolio or can be redeveloped to that level and that satisfy the company s strategic plans and pricing requirements 
in march  the company acquired the minority interest in great lakes crossing  bringing its ownership in the shopping center to 
in october  the company acquired swerdlow real estate group s swerdlow s interest in dolphin mall  bringing its ownership in the shopping center to 
in may  the operating partnership acquired a general partnership interest in sunvalley associates  a california general partnership that owns the sunvalley shopping center located in concord  california 
also in may  the company purchased an additional interest in arizona mills 
the company has a interest in the center as of the purchase date 
expansions of the centers another potential element of growth is the strategic expansion of existing properties to update and enhance their market positions  by replacing or adding new anchor stores or increasing mall tenant space 
most of the centers have been designed to accommodate expansions 
expansion projects can be as significant as new shopping center construction in terms of scope and cost  requiring governmental and existing anchor store approvals  design and engineering activities  including rerouting utilities  providing additional parking areas or decking  acquiring additional land  and relocating anchors and mall tenants all of which must take place with a minimum of disruption to existing tenants and customers

rental rates as leases have expired in the centers  the company has generally been able to rent the available space  either to the existing tenant or a new tenant  at rental rates that are higher than those of the expired leases 
in a period of increasing sales  rents on new leases will tend to rise as tenants expectations of future growth become more optimistic 
in periods of slower growth or declining sales  rents on new leases will grow more slowly or will decline for the opposite reason 
however  center revenues nevertheless increase as older leases roll over or are terminated early and replaced with new leases negotiated at current rental rates that are usually higher than the average rates for existing leases 
the following tables contain certain information regarding per square foot minimum rent at centers that have been owned and open for at least two years 
average minimum rent per square foot all mall tenants stores opening during year square feet of gla opened    stores closing during year square feet of gla closed    excluding tenant spaces greater than  square feet opened in or average minimum rent per square foot all mall tenants stores opening during year square feet of gla opened   stores closing during year square feet of gla closed   amounts have been restated to include centers comparable to the statistic 
excludes spaces greater than  square feet closed in or lease expirations the following table shows lease expirations based on information available as of december  for the next ten years for the centers in operation at that date lease expiration year number of leases expiring leased area in square footage annualized base rent under expiring leases in thousands annualized base rent under expiring leases per square foot percent of total leased square footage represented by expiring leases a higher percentage of space at value centers is typically rented to major and mall tenants at lower rents than the portfolio average 
excluding value centers  the annualized base rent under expiring leases is greater by a range of to or an average of for the periods presented within this table 
excludes leases that expire in for which renewal leases or leases with replacement tenants have been executed as of december  the company believes that the information in the table is not necessarily indicative of what will occur in the future because of several factors  but principally because of early lease terminations at the centers 
for example  the average remaining term of the leases that were terminated during the period to was approximately two years 
the average term of leases signed during and was approximately eight years 
in addition  mall tenants at the centers may seek the protection of the bankruptcy laws  which could result in the termination of such tenants leases and thus cause a reduction in cash flow 
in  approximately of leases were so affected compared to in this statistic has ranged from to since the company went public in since  the annual provision for losses on accounts receivable has been less than of annual revenues 
occupancy for centers owned and open for all of and  leased space  ending occupancy  and average occupancy were   and  respectively  in  and   and  respectively  in mall tenant average occupancy  ending occupancy  and leased space rates of all centers are as follows year ended december leased space ending occupancy average occupancy major tenants no single retail company represents or more of the company s revenues 
the combined operations of the limited  inc accounted for approximately of mall gla as of december  and of minimum rent 
no other single retail company accounted for more than of mall gla or of minimum rent

additionally  these same factors will influence the company s decision whether to go forward on the development of new centers and may affect the ultimate economic performance and value of projects under construction see other risks associated with the development of new centers under business of the company development of new centers 
such factors include o changes in the national  regional  and or local economic and geopolitical climates  o competition from other shopping centers  discount stores  outlet malls  discount shopping clubs  direct mail  and the internet in attracting customers and tenants  o increases in operating costs  o the public perception of the safety of customers at the shopping centers  o environmental or legal liabilities  o availability and cost of financing  and o uninsured losses  whether because of unavailability of coverage or in excess of policy specifications and insured limits  including those resulting from wars  acts of terrorism  riots or civil disturbances  or losses from earthquakes or floods 
in addition  the value of shopping centers may be adversely affected by o changes in government regulations  and o changes in real estate zoning and tax laws 
adverse changes in the economic performance and value of shopping centers would adversely affect the company s income and cash available to pay dividends 
third party interests in the centers some of the shopping centers which the company develops and leases are partially owned by non affiliated partners through joint venture arrangements 
as a result  the company may not be able to control all decisions regarding those shopping centers and may be required to take actions that are in the interest of the joint venture partners but not the company s best interests 
bankruptcy of mall tenants or joint venture partners the company could be adversely affected by the bankruptcy of third parties 
the bankruptcy of a mall tenant could result in the termination of its lease which would lower the amount of cash generated by that mall 
in addition  if a department store operating an anchor at one of our shopping centers were to go into bankruptcy and cease operating  its closing may lead to reduced customer traffic and lower mall tenant sales which would  in turn  affect the amount of rent our tenants pay the company 
the profitability of shopping centers held in a joint venture could also be adversely affected by the bankruptcy of one of the joint venture partners if  because of certain provisions of the bankruptcy laws  the company was unable to make important decisions in a timely fashion or became subject to additional liabilities 
investments in and loans to third parties the company occasionally extends credit to third parties in connection with the sales of land or other transactions 
the company has occasionally made investments in marketable and other equity securities 
the company is exposed to risk in the event the values of its investments and or its loans decrease due to overall market conditions  business failure  and or other nonperformance by the investees or counterparties 
third party contracts the company provides property management  leasing  development  and other administrative services to centers transferred to general motors pension trusts  other third parties and to certain taubman affiliates 
the contracts under which these services are provided may be canceled or not renewed or may be renegotiated on terms less favorable to the company 
certain overhead costs allocated to these contracts would not be eliminated if the contracts were to be canceled or not renewed 
inability to maintain status as a reit o the company may not be able to maintain its status as a real estate investment trust  or reit  for federal income tax purposes with the result that the income distributed to shareholders will not be deductible in computing taxable income and instead would be subject to tax at regular corporate rates 
although the company believes it is organized and operates in a manner to maintain its reit qualification  many of the reit requirements of the internal revenue code are very complex and have limited judicial or administrative interpretations 
changes in tax laws or regulations or new administrative interpretations and court decisions may also affect the company s ability to maintain reit status in the future 
if the company fails to qualify as a reit  its income may also be subject to the alternative minimum tax 
if the company does not maintain its reit status in any year  it may be unable to elect to be treated as a reit for the next four taxable years 
in addition  if the company fails to meet the internal revenue code s requirement that it distribute to shareholders at least of its otherwise taxable income  less capital gain income  the company will be subject to a nondeductible excise tax 
the internal revenue code does provide that an additional dividend payment may be declared and paid in the following taxable year so that the company will be deemed to have distributed at least of its taxable income to shareholders and thereby maintain its reit status 
the excise tax is due and payable on the additional dividend payment made in the succeeding tax year in order to meet the distribution requirement 
o although the company currently intends to maintain its status as a reit  future economic  market  legal  tax  or other considerations may cause it to determine that it would be in the company s and its shareholders best interests to revoke its reit election 
as noted above  if the company revokes its reit election  it will not be able to elect reit status for the next four taxable years 
environmental matters all of the centers presently owned by the company not including option interests in certain pre development projects or any of the real estate managed but not included in the company s portfolio have been subject to environmental assessments 
the company is not aware of any environmental liability relating to the centers or any other property  in which they have or had an interest whether as an owner or operator that the company believes  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  assets  or results of operations 
no assurances can be given  however  that all environmental liabilities have been identified or that no prior owner  operator  or current occupant has created an environmental condition not known to the company 
moreover  no assurances can be given that future laws  ordinances  or regulations will not impose any material environmental liability or that the current environmental condition of the centers will not be affected by tenants and occupants of the centers  by the condition of properties in the vicinity of the centers such as the presence of underground storage tanks  or by third parties unrelated to the company 
there are asbestos containing materials acms at some of the older centers  primarily in the form of floor tiles  roof coatings  and mastics 
the floor tiles  roof coatings  and mastics are generally in good condition 
the manager has an operations and maintenance program that details operating procedures with respect to acms prior to any renovation and that requires periodic inspection for any change in condition of existing acms 
personnel the company has engaged the manager to provide real estate management  acquisition  development  and administrative services required by the company and its properties 
as of december   the manager had  full time employees 
the following table provides a breakdown of employees by operational areas as of december  center operations property management leasing development financial services other total number of employees as of january   certain employees  who previously had been employees of affiliates of the manager  became direct employees of the manager

the company cautions that although forward looking statements reflect the company s good faith beliefs and best judgment based upon current information  these statements are qualified by important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements  including those risks  uncertainties  and factors detailed from time to time in reports filed with the sec  and in particular those set forth under the headings general risks of the company and environmental matters in the company s annual report on form k 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements of taubman centers  inc and the notes thereto 
general background and performance measurement the company owns a managing general partner s interest in the taubman realty group limited partnership the operating partnership or trg  through which the company conducts all of its operations 
the operating partnership owns  develops  acquires  and operates regional shopping centers nationally 
the consolidated businesses consist of shopping centers that are controlled by ownership or contractual agreement  development projects for future regional shopping centers  and the taubman company llc the manager 
shopping centers that are not controlled and that are owned through joint ventures with third parties unconsolidated joint ventures are accounted for under the equity method 
the operations of the shopping centers are best understood by measuring their performance as a whole  without regard to the company s ownership interest 
consequently  in addition to the discussion of the operations of the consolidated businesses  the operations of the unconsolidated joint ventures are presented and discussed as a whole 
the company opened one new shopping center during and four new shopping centers during results of operations new center openings 
during  the company acquired an interest in sunvalley and sold its interests in la cumbre plaza and paseo nuevo results of operations acquisitions and dispositions 
additional statistics that exclude the new centers  sunvalley  la cumbre plaza  and paseo nuevo are provided to present the performance of comparable centers in the company s continuing operations 
current operating trends in and  the regional shopping center industry has been affected by the softening of the national economy 
economic pressures that affect consumer confidence  job growth  energy costs  and income gains can affect retail sales growth and impact the company s ability to lease vacancies and negotiate rents at advantageous rates 
the impact of a soft economy on the company s current results of operations can be moderated by lease cancellation income  which tends to increase in down cycles of the economy 
while the company s operating statistics have recently shown some improvement  the sales environment remains challenging and  given the very real geopolitical risks  there is no assurance that these trends will continue 
mall tenant sales and center revenues over the long term  the level of mall tenant sales is the single most important determinant of revenues of the shopping centers because mall tenants provide approximately of these revenues and because mall tenant sales determine the amount of rent  percentage rent  and recoverable expenses together  total occupancy costs that mall tenants can afford to pay 
however  levels of mall tenant sales can be considerably more volatile in the short run than total occupancy costs 
the company believes that the ability of tenants to pay occupancy costs and earn profits over long periods of time increases as sales per square foot increase  whether through inflation or real growth in customer spending 
because most mall tenants have certain fixed expenses  the occupancy costs that they can afford to pay and still be profitable are a higher percentage of sales at higher sales per square foot 
the following table summarizes occupancy costs  excluding utilities  for mall tenants as a percentage of mall tenant sales 
mall tenant sales in thousands    sales per square foot minimum rents percentage rents expense recoveries mall tenant occupancy costs sales per square foot has been restated to exclude paseo nuevo and la cumbre plaza 
for shopping centers that have been owned and open for at least two years  mall tenant occupancy costs as a percentage of sales were and for and  respectively 
tenant sales per square foot in decreased by compared to sales directly impact the amount of percentage rents certain tenants and anchors pay 
the effects of declines in sales experienced during and on the company s operations are moderated by the relatively minor share of total rents approximately two percent percentage rents represent 
however  if negative sales trends were to continue  the company s ability to lease vacancies and negotiate rents at advantageous rates could be adversely affected 
rental rates as leases have expired in the shopping centers  the company has generally been able to rent the available space  either to the existing tenant or a new tenant  at rental rates that are higher than those of the expired leases 
in a period of increasing sales  rents on new leases will tend to rise as tenants expectations of future growth become more optimistic 
in periods of slower growth or declining sales  such as the company is currently experiencing  rents on new leases will grow more slowly or will decline for the opposite reason 
however  center revenues nevertheless increase as older leases roll over or are terminated early and replaced with new leases negotiated at current rental rates that are usually higher than the average rates for existing leases 
the following table contains certain information regarding per square foot minimum rent at the shopping centers that have been owned and open for at least two years 
average minimum rent per square foot all mall tenants stores opening during year square feet of gla opened    stores closing during year square feet of gla closed    rent per square foot information has been restated to exclude paseo nuevo and la cumbre plaza 
the opening and closing rents statistics are not computed on comparable tenant spaces  and can vary significantly from period to period depending on the total amount  location  and average size of tenant space opening and closing in the period 
during  the openings included several large spaces  which typically lease at lower rents 
the following table contains information regarding per square foot minimum rent at shopping centers that have been owned and open for at least two years and excluding tenants greater than  square feet opening during or average minimum rent per square foot all mall tenants stores opening during year square feet of gla opened   stores closing during year square feet of gla closed   excludes spaces greater than  square feet closed in or generally  the rent spread between opening and closing stores is in the company s historic range of to per square foot 
this statistic is difficult to predict in part because of early lease terminations  which may have actual average closing rents per square foot that vary from the average rent per square foot of scheduled lease expirations 
occupancy mall tenant average occupancy  ending occupancy  and leased space rates are as follows all centers leased space ending occupancy average occupancy comparable centers leased space ending occupancy average occupancy occupancy trends showed some improvement in the lower overall occupancy and leased space in and as compared to reflect the opening of the four centers in at occupancy levels lower than the average of the existing portfolio 
a number of unanticipated early lease terminations and bankruptcies accounted for the majority of the decline in comparable center occupancy in from tenant bankruptcy filings as a percentage of the total number of tenant leases was in  compared to in and in seasonality the regional shopping center industry is seasonal in nature  with mall tenant sales highest in the fourth quarter due to the christmas season  and with lesser  though still significant  sales fluctuations associated with the easter holiday and back to school events 
while minimum rents and recoveries are generally not subject to seasonal factors  most leases are scheduled to expire in the first quarter  and the majority of new stores open in the second half of the year in anticipation of the christmas selling season 
additionally  most percentage rents are recorded in the fourth quarter 
accordingly  revenues and occupancy levels are generally highest in the fourth quarter 
st nd rd th quarter quarter quarter quarter total in thousands mall tenant sales      revenues      occupancy ending comparable average comparable ending average leased space comparable all centers excludes centers that opened in and  la cumbre plaza  paseo nuevo  and sunvalley 
because the seasonality of sales contrasts with the generally fixed nature of minimum rents and recoveries  mall tenant occupancy costs the sum of minimum rents  percentage rents  and expense recoveries relative to sales are considerably higher in the first three quarters than they are in the fourth quarter 
st nd rd th quarter quarter quarter quarter total minimum rents percentage rents expense recoveries mall tenant occupancy costs results of operations new center openings the mall at millenia  a million square foot regional center in which the operating partnership has a interest  opened in october  in orlando  florida

new center results the mall at millenia was leased at opening and occupied by december the center is expected to achieve an approximately return in international plaza and wellington green are performing as expected with improving occupancy  leasing progress  and sales performance 
the return on wellington green was approximately in and is anticipated to be about in  international plaza s return was approximately in and is anticipated to be approximately in the performance of the shops at willow bend has been adversely affected by local and national economic conditions resulting in lower occupancy and sales levels than expected 
in addition  willow bend faces significant competition from the large supply of retail space that opened in the area within the last two years 
the company does not expect significant improvements in the fundamentals of willow bend until the local economy strengthens 
as a result of willow bend s current operating performance  a paydown of the construction loan will be required in july  at its first of two  one year  extension dates 
during  the company paid down million of this facility  principally to take advantage of the lower interest rates under the company s line of credit 
the return on willow bend was approximately in and is expected to be slightly lower in while the performance of dolphin mall was adversely affected by slower than expected lease up  rental concessions and lower than expected expense recoveries  dolphin s performance is continuing to improve 
vehicle counts are averaging about  per month and sales at the center are increasing steadily 
tenant collections have also increased  and the leasing environment has improved 
dolphin mall is subject to annual special tax assessments by a local community development district cdd for certain infrastructure improvements on the property 
in the first quarter of  the cdd refinanced its outstanding bonds to extend the term from years to years and to reduce the interest rate 
in addition  the first annual assessment began in rather than in  resulting in a reversal of million previously expensed 
the annual assessments will be based on allocations of the cost of the infrastructure between the properties that benefit 
the total allocation of cost to dolphin mall based on current assessments is approximately million with a assessment of approximately million 
a portion of these assessments is expected to be recovered from tenants 
the company s return on dolphin mall  excluding the favorable million reversal described above  was approximately in  and is expected to be approximately in considering the opportunities for growth  the company anticipates that the net operating income of dolphin mall will double over the next three to five years  which would result in a return of to on the company s million incremental investment in dolphin results of operations acquisitions and dispositions 
estimates regarding returns are forward looking statements and certain significant factors could cause the actual results to differ materially  including but not limited to actual results of negotiations with tenants  timing of tenant openings  early lease terminations and bankruptcies  sales performance of the centers  and increases in operating costs

derivatives effective january   the company adopted sfas and its related amendments and interpretations  which establish accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments 
the company uses derivative instruments primarily to manage exposure to interest rate risks inherent in variable rate debt and refinancings 
the company routinely uses cap  swap  and treasury lock agreements to meet these objectives 
the initial adoption of sfas on january  resulted in a reduction to income of approximately million as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle and a reduction to oci of million 
these amounts represented the transition adjustments necessary to mark the company s share of interest rate agreements to fair value as of january  in addition to the transition adjustment  the following table contains the effect that derivative instruments had on net income during the years ended december  and operating partnership s share in millions of dollars change in fair value of swap agreement not designated as a hedge payments under swap agreements hedge ineffectiveness related to changes in time value of interest rate agreements adjustment of accumulated other comprehensive income for amounts recognized in net income net reduction to income comparable center operations the performance of the company s portfolio can be measured through comparisons of comparable centers operations 
during  revenues excluding land sales and individual lease cancellations over thousand per center less operating costs operating and recoverable expenses of those centers owned and open for at lease two years increased approximately three percent in comparison to the same centers results in this growth was primarily due to increases in minimum rents  specialty retail income  and decreases in bad debt expense  partially offset by a decrease in percentage rent 
the company expects that comparable center operations will increase annually by two to three percent 
this is a forward looking statement and certain significant factors could cause the actual results to differ materially  refer to the general risks of the company in the company s annual report on form k for the year ended december  other income the company has certain additional sources of income beyond its rental revenues  recoveries from tenants  and revenues from management  leasing  and development services  as summarized in the following table 
shopping center related revenues increased in primarily due to a full year of the new centers that opened in the company expects that the shopping center related revenues will grow modestly in while gains on peripheral land sales in were greater than in the prior year  the company expects that gains on land sales will be about million 
interest income in decreased primarily due to the settlement of the swerdlow note  the company expects that interest income will range between million and million 
lease cancellation income is dependent on the overall economy and performance of particular retailers in specific locations and is difficult to predict  prior to  it has averaged between million and million and the company currently projects to be at the high end of this range in however  the company is currently negotiating with several tenants and this amount may be exceeded 
estimates regarding anticipated other income are forward looking statements and certain significant factors could cause the actual results to differ materially  including but not limited to actual results of negotiations with tenants  counterparties  and potential purchasers of peripheral land  and timing of transactions 
operating partnership s share in millions of dollars shopping center related revenues gains on peripheral land sales lease cancellation revenue interest income insurance the tragic events of september  had an impact on the company s insurance coverage 
the company had coverage for terrorist acts in its policies that expired in april however  such coverage was excluded from its standard property policies at renewal 
the company obtained a separate policy although with lower limits than the prior coverage for terrorist acts 
in november  congress passed the terrorism risk insurance act of  which required insurance companies to offer terrorism coverage to all existing insured companies for an additional cost 
as a result  the company s insurance coverage is now provided without a sub limit for terrorism in its standard property policy  just as it was prior to april  eliminating the need for separate terrorism insurance policies

the company used excess proceeds of million to pay down lines of credit 
in march  the company acquired the minority interest in great lakes crossing for million in cash 
application of critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the financial statements and disclosures 
some of these estimates and assumptions require application of difficult  subjective  and or complex judgment  often about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods 
the company is required to make such estimates and assumptions when applying the following accounting policies 
valuation of shopping centers all properties  including those under construction and or owned by joint ventures  are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
impairment would be recognized when the sum of expected cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying value of the property 
the expected cash flows of a shopping center are dependent on estimates and other factors subject to change  including changes in the national  regional  and or local economic climates  competition from other shopping centers  stores  clubs  mailings  and the internet  increases in operating costs  and bankruptcy and or other changes in the condition of third parties  including anchors and tenants 
these factors could cause the company s expected future cash flows from a shopping center to change  and  as a result  an impairment could be considered to have occurred 
to the extent an impairment has occurred  the excess carrying value of the property over its estimated fair value is charged against operations 
there were no impairment charges recognized in the periods covered within this annual report 
as of december   the consolidated net book value of the company s properties was billion  over of the company s consolidated assets  the company also has varying ownership percentages in the properties of unconsolidated joint ventures with a total combined net book value of billion 
these amounts include certain development costs that are described in the policy that follows 
capitalization of development costs in developing shopping centers  the company typically obtains land or land options  zoning and regulatory approvals  anchor commitments  and financing arrangements during a process that may take several years and during which the company may incur significant costs 
the company capitalizes all development costs once it is considered probable that a project will reach a successful conclusion 
prior to this time  the company expenses all costs relating to a potential development  including payroll  and includes these costs in its funds from operations 
many factors in the development of a shopping center are beyond the control of the company  including changes in the national  regional  and or local economic climates  competition from other shopping centers  stores  clubs  mailing  and the internet  availability and cost of financing  changes in regulation  laws  and zoning  and decisions made by third parties  including anchors 
these factors could cause the company s assessment of the probability of a development project reaching a successful conclusion to change 
if a project subsequently was considered less than probable of reaching a successful conclusion  a charge against operations for previously capitalized development costs would occur 
the company s million balance of development pre construction costs as december  consists primarily of costs related to a project in syosset  new york 
both neiman marcus and lord taylor have made announcements committing to the project 
although the company still needs to obtain a special use permit and site plan approval from the oyster bay town board to move forward with the project  the company is encouraged that the appellate court has recently affirmed the new york state supreme court s decision to annul the unfavorable zoning actions of the oyster bay town board 
while the company expects to be successful in this effort  the process may still not be resolved in the near future 
in addition  if the litigation is unsuccessful  the company expects to consider its alternatives  including possible other uses for the site  but may ultimately decide to abandon the project 
valuation of accounts receivable rents and expense recoveries from tenants are the company s principal source of income  they represent over of the company s revenues 
in generating this income  the company will routinely have accounts receivable due from tenants 
the collectibility of tenant receivables is affected by bankruptcies  changes in the economy  and the ability of the tenants to perform under the terms of their lease agreements 
while the company estimates potentially uncollectible receivables and provides for them through charges against income  actual experience may differ from those estimates 
also  if a tenant were not able to perform under the terms of its lease agreement  receivable balances not previously provided for may be required to be charged against operations 
bad debt expense was approximately of total revenues in  while bankruptcy filings affected of tenant leases during the year 
new accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
consolidation of variable interest entities 
this interpretation addresses consolidation by business enterprises of certain variable interest entities and the conditions under which they should be included in consolidated financial statements 
the company does not believe that interpretation no 
will change the entities which the company currently consolidates in its financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of fasb statement no 

this statement amends fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of statement to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the company has determined that it will apply the prospective method of implementing sfas no 
 and apply its recognition provisions to all employee awards granted  modified  or settled after january  there were no employee awards granted  modified  or settled in in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
interpretation no 
elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
interpretation no 
would require the recognition of an obligation by the company for a guarantee of debt of the unconsolidated joint ventures issued after december   the company does not have any present intentions of issuing any such guarantee 
the disclosure requirements of interpretation no 
were effective for the financial statements and applied to the company s guarantee of the debt of the mall at millenia 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
sfas no 
is effective prospectively for exit or disposal activities initiated after december   with earlier adoption encouraged 
sfas no 
would affect the timing of recognition costs of any exit or disposal activities 
however  the company does not believe that the adoption of sfas no 
will otherwise have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of sfas nos 
  and  amendment of sfas  and technical corrections  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after may  sfas rescinds sfas  sfas and sfas and amends sfas to modify the accounting for sale leaseback transactions 
sfas required the classification of gains and losses resulting from extinguishment of debt to be classified as extraordinary items 
such gains and losses will now be classified as extraordinary items only if they meet the requirements of apb as being both unusual and infrequent 
the company expects to reclassify extraordinary losses of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  from extraordinary items upon adoption of sfas on january  presentation of operating results the following tables contain the combined operating results of the company s consolidated businesses and the unconsolidated joint ventures 
income allocated to the minority partners in the operating partnership and preferred interests is deducted to arrive at the results allocable to the company s common shareowners 
because the net equity of the operating partnership is less than zero  the income allocated to the minority partners is equal to their share of distributions 
the net equity of these minority partners is less than zero due to accumulated distributions in excess of net income and not as a result of operating losses 
distributions to partners are usually greater than net income because net income includes non cash charges for depreciation and amortization  although distributions were less than net income during due to the gain on the disposition of lakeside 
also  losses allocable to minority partners in certain consolidated joint ventures are added back to arrive at the net results of the company 
the company s average ownership percentage of the operating partnership was in both and  and in the operating results in the following tables include the supplemental earnings measures of ebitda and funds from operations ffo 
ebitda represents earnings before interest and depreciation and amortization  excluding gains on dispositions of depreciated operating properties 
ffo is defined as income before extraordinary items  cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  real estate depreciation and amortization  and the allocation to the minority interest in the operating partnership  less preferred dividends and distributions 
gains on dispositions of depreciated operating properties are excluded from ffo 
ffo is used by the company in measuring performance  determining the amount of dividends payable to shareowners  and in formulating corporate goals and compensation 
funds from operations does not represent cash flows from operations  as defined by generally accepted accounting principles  and should not be considered to be an alternative to net income as an indicator of operating performance or to cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity 
however  the national association of real estate investment trusts suggests that funds from operations is a useful supplemental measure of operating performance for reits 
funds from operations as presented by the company may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 
in  an million charge related to technology investments and million of costs related to the unsolicited tender offer were excluded from ebitda and ffo and in a million charge related to a technology investment was also excluded

estimates of future capital spending include only projects approved by the company s board of directors and  consequently  estimates will change as new projects are approved 
estimates regarding capital expenditures  occupancy  and returns on new developments presented above are forward looking statements and certain significant factors could cause the actual results to differ materially  including but not limited to actual results of negotiations with anchors  tenants  and contractors  changes in the scope and number of projects  cost overruns  timing of expenditures  financing considerations  actual time to complete projects  changes in economic climate  competition from others attracting tenants and customers  increases in operating costs  timing of tenant openings  and early lease terminations and bankruptcies 
dividends the company pays regular quarterly dividends to its common and series a preferred shareowners 
dividends to its common shareowners are at the discretion of the board of directors and depend on the cash available to the company  its financial condition  capital and other requirements  and such other factors as the board of directors deems relevant 
to qualify as a reit  the company must distribute at least of its reit taxable income to its shareowners  as well as meet certain other requirements 
preferred dividends accrue regardless of whether earnings  cash availability  or contractual obligations were to prohibit the current payment of dividends 
the preferred stock became callable in october the company has no present intention to redeem the preferred equity 
on december   the company declared a quarterly dividend of per common share payable january  to shareowners of record on december  the board of directors also declared a quarterly dividend of per share on the company s series a preferred stock  paid december  to shareowners of record on december  dividends declared on the company s common and preferred stock and their tax status are presented in the following tables 
year dividends per common share declared return of capital ordinary income capital gains unrecaptured section capital gains year dividends per series a preferred share declared ordinary income capital gains unrecaptured section capital gains the portion of the dividends paid to common and preferred shareowners in for capital gains and unrecaptured section gains are designated as capital gain dividends for tax purposes 
the tax status of total common dividends declared and to be declared  assuming continuation of a per common share quarterly dividend  is estimated to be approximately return of capital  and approximately ordinary income 
the tax status of total dividends to be paid on series a preferred stock is estimated to be ordinary income 
these are forward looking statements and certain significant factors could cause the actual results to differ materially  including the amount of dividends declared  changes in the company s share of anticipated taxable income of the operating partnership due to the actual results of the operating partnership  changes in the number of the company s outstanding shares  property acquisitions or dispositions  financing transactions  including refinancing of existing debt  changes in interest rates  amount and nature of development activities  and changes in the tax laws or their application 
the annual determination of the company s common dividends is based on anticipated funds from operations available after preferred dividends  as well as assessments of annual capital spending  financing considerations  and other appropriate factors 
over the past several years  the company had determined that the growth in common dividends would be less than the growth in funds from operations 
this had resulted in the payout ratio defined as common dividends per share as a percentage of funds from operations being reduced from in to less than in the company expects to evaluate its policy and the benefits of increasing dividends at a higher rate than historical increases  subject to its assessment of cash requirements 
any inability of the operating partnership or its joint ventures to secure financing as required to fund maturing debts  capital expenditures and changes in working capital  including development activities and expansions  may require the utilization of cash to satisfy such obligations  thereby possibly reducing distributions to partners of the operating partnership and funds available to the company for the payment of dividends
