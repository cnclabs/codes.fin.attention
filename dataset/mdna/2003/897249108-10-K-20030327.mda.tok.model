the subrogation accounts receivable represents the company s fees for cases in which the parties have reached settlements including settlements of the subrogation claims of the company s clients  but the company has not yet received the cash from the settlement of the subrogation claim 
the company withholds its fee from the gross recovery proceeds of the subrogation claims that it collects on behalf of its clients 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for the estimated loss from settlements that are later broken or significantly delayed  based on the company s historical experience 
the accounts receivable balance that at december  and was attributable to subrogation claims represented approximately  settled cases for approximately clients and approximately  settled cases for approximately clients  respectively  each one subject to its own settlement agreement with its own settling parties 
if the receipt of cash from a significant number of the settled cases comprising the subrogation accounts receivable balance were significantly delayed by third parties to those settled cases because of broken settlement agreements  for example  additional allowances may be required 
approximately million and million of the company s accounts receivable balance of million at december  and  respectively  is attributable to provider bill audit services 
the provider bill audit accounts receivable represents the amounts invoiced by the company to its clients for its fee for completed provider audits 
for each completed audit  prior to invoicing  the company obtains a sign off from the provider representative as evidence of agreement with the audit findings 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for the estimated losses arising from adjustments the client may make to invoiced amounts based on the client s inability to recoup the claim overpayment from the provider 
the amount of the allowance is based on the company s historical experience related to client adjustments
