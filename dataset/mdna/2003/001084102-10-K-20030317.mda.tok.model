item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we are a leading manufacturer and distributor of agricultural equipment and related replacement parts throughout the world 
we sell a full range of agricultural equipment  including tractors  combines  hay tools  sprayers  forage equipment and implements 
our products are marketed under the following brand names agco  agcoallis  agcostar  ag chem  challenger  farmhand  fendt  fieldstar  gleaner  glencoe  hesston  lor al  massey ferguson  new idea  rogator  soilteq  spra coupe  sunflower  terra gator  tye  white and willmar 
we distribute most of our products through a combination of approximately  independent dealers  distributors  associates and licensees 
in addition  we provide retail financing in north america  the united kingdom  france  germany  spain  ireland and brazil through our finance joint ventures with rabobank 
results of operations we sell our equipment and replacement parts to our independent dealers  distributors and other customers 
a large majority of our sales are to independent dealers and distributors that sell our products to the end user 
to the extent practicable  we attempt to sell products to our dealers and distributors on a level basis throughout the year to reduce the effect of seasonal demands on our manufacturing operations and to minimize our investment in inventory 
however  retail sales by dealers to farmers are highly seasonal and are linked to the planting and harvesting seasons 
in certain markets  particularly in north america  there is often a time lag  which varies based on the timing and level of retail demand  between our sale of the equipment to the dealer and the dealer s sale to a retail customer 
during this time lag between the wholesale and retail sale  dealers may not return equipment to us unless the dealer s contract is terminated or we agree to accept returned products 
in most cases  commissions payable under our salesman incentive programs are paid at the time of the retail sale  as opposed to when the products are sold to dealers

gross margins improved from in to in our results were negatively impacted by start up losses relating to the challenger product line introduction  as well as higher restricted stock compensation expense and restructuring expenses 
the impact of the challenger acquisition was a reduction in operating income of approximately million  or per share 
operating income in also benefited from lower intangible asset amortization of approximately million  or per share  due to the adoption of sfas no 
acquisitions on november   we completed our acquisition of sunflower manufacturing co  inc  a leading producer of tillage  seeding and specialty harvesting equipment  serving the north american market 
sunflower s products have been marketed and sold under the highly respected sunflower brand name for over years and have established a reputation for innovation  performance and durability 
long term plans include expansion of the products into export markets and the addition of new technology and some allied product innovations from agco

retail sales industry demand for agricultural equipment in showed mixed results within the major markets of the world 
during  commodity prices improved over levels supporting improving fundamentals for farm income 
in addition  a new united states farm bill was passed in  which should provide more stability to farm income than emergency aid payments made in prior years 
while industry fundamentals improved in  dry weather conditions in the united states negatively impacted demand 
in europe  concerns over livestock diseases declined and support payment levels under the common agricultural policy generally were maintained 
in south america  higher commodity prices and continued availability of affordable financing supported strong demand 
in the united states and canada  industry unit retail sales of tractors increased approximately compared to  resulting from increases in the compact tractor segment  relatively flat demand in the utility tractor segment and a significant decrease in the high horsepower tractor segment 
industry unit retail sales of combines decreased approximately when compared to the prior year  primarily as a result of dry weather conditions and poor crop production in many key areas and transition issues with support payments 
despite this decline  our unit retail sales of tractors and combines in north america increased in when compared to the increase in unit retail sales of combines during was partially due to production delays in

industry unit retail sales of sprayers in north america decreased approximately in when compared to agco s retail sales of sprayers also declined compared to statements of operations net sales for were  million compared to  million for the increase was primarily attributable to the inclusion of a full year of ag chem sales in  the challenger product line introduction  foreign currency translation and improved sales performance in the majority of markets 
ag chem  acquired in april  generated a net sales increase in over the partial year in of million 
the new challenger product line generated net sales of million and sunflower generated net sales of million during currency translation positively impacted net sales by million  primarily due to the strengthening of the euro offset by the weakness of the brazilian real

sprayers net sales excluding currency impact increased million compared to due to a full year of ag chem in the results 
gross profit was million of net sales in compared to million of net sales for gross margins improved primarily due to the addition of high margin ag chem sales  cost reduction initiatives and higher production levels 
in addition  production cost inefficiencies at our hesston plant in the first three quarters of of million were eliminated in these cost reductions were partially offset by lower margins in the challenger product line due to low track tractor production volume and an unfavorable mix of products sold

engineering expenses for were million of net sales compared to million of net sales for this increase is due to the inclusion of a full year of engineering expenses of ag chem  as well as increased engineering costs as a result of the challenger acquisition 
restricted stock compensation expense was million in compared to million in due to the rise in our common stock price in the first and fourth quarters of  restricted stock compensation awards granted to key executives in were earned 
under the ltip  restricted stock awards are earned upon increases in our common stock price 
shares earned under the ltip remain restricted after being earned and cannot be sold for a period of three to five years 
a cash bonus equal to of the value of the stock is also paid to participants at the time the shares are earned to facilitate the payment of the current income tax liability incurred by the participants 
of the million expense recorded during  approximately million was a non cash expense 
in december  our board of directors approved a new ltip plan award for senior executives 
the plan allows for restricted shares to be earned over the next five years if our 
table of contents stock price increases above the base price of established in the new plan 
additional compensation expense would be incurred in the future should any of the levels be earned above the base price established under the plan

other expense  net for also included a gain of million associated with the sale of a minority interest investment in a european agricultural equipment company 
we recorded an income tax provision of million in compared to million in during  we recognized a non cash income tax charge of million related to increasing the valuation allowance for certain us deferred tax assets 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires the establishment of a valuation allowance when there is uncertainty as to the realizability of deferred tax assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we assessed the likelihood that our deferred tax assets would be recovered from future taxable income and determined that an adjustment to the valuation allowance was appropriate 
at december   we had deferred tax assets of million  including million related to net operating loss carryforwards 
at december   we have recorded total valuation allowances as an offset to the deferred tax assets of million primarily related to the us net operating loss carryforwards 
realization of the remaining net deferred tax assets is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income in future periods 
we believe it is more likely than not that the remaining net deferred tax asset will be realized 
equity in earnings of affiliates was million for compared to million for equity in earnings in our retail finance joint ventures in was million higher than in during  we recorded a million extraordinary loss  net of taxes  representing the write off of the unamortized debt issuance costs associated with our revolving credit facility  which was refinanced in april during the first quarter of  we recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million  net of taxes  or per share  related to the adoption of sfas no

our results were negatively impacted by losses at ag chem for the period since acquisition 
the ag chem acquisition was completed after ag chem s seasonally strongest period  typically the first calendar quarter of the year 
the impact of the ag chem acquisition  excluding restructuring expenses  was a reduction in net income of approximately million  or per share 
acquisitions on april   we completed the acquisition of ag chem  a manufacturer and distributor of self propelled fertilizer and chemical sprayers for pre emergent and post emergent applications 
this acquisition provided us a leading position in the self propelled sprayer market

retail sales industry demand for agricultural equipment in showed mixed results within the major markets of the world compared to the prior year 
commodity prices remained at relatively low levels in caused by high global commodity stocks and lower export demand for farm commodities 
these conditions adversely affect farm income thereby negatively impacting demand for new equipment purchases 
in the united states and canada  industry retail unit sales of tractors and combines for increased approximately and  respectively  compared to  reflecting an improvement from the relatively low industry levels in our retail unit sales of tractors in north america increased and our retail unit sales of combines declined in compared to delays related to the relocation and start up of combine production in our hesston  kansas facility negatively impacted our sales

gross profit was million of net sales in compared to million of net sales for gross margins improved primarily due to cost reduction initiatives and the impact of new higher margin products 
this margin improvement was offset  in part  by cost inefficiencies during the first three quarters of in the hesston  kansas manufacturing facility of approximately million during the initial production of products relocated from closed facilities 
these inefficiencies were primarily associated with the initial production run of combines and planters in this facility 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses for were million of net sales compared to million of net sales for the increase as a percentage of net sales was the result of ag chem  which had a higher sg a expense ratio to net sales than the remainder of our operations

to the extent possible  we attempt to sell products to our dealers and distributors on a level basis throughout the year to reduce the effect of seasonal demands on our manufacturing operations and to minimize investments in inventory 
however  retail sales of agricultural equipment are highly seasonal  with farmers traditionally purchasing agricultural equipment in the spring and fall in conjunction with the major planting and harvesting seasons 
recent acquisitions on november   we completed the acquisition of sunflower manufacturing co  inc  a former product line of spx corporation 
sunflower is a leading producer of tillage  seeding and specialty harvesting equipment  serving the north american market and is located in beloit  kansas 
the purchase price was approximately million and was funded through borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
the sunflower acquisition was accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  and accordingly  the purchase price has been allocated to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on a preliminary estimate of fair values as of the acquisition date 
on march   we completed our agreement with caterpillar to acquire the design  assembly and marketing of the new mt series of caterpillar s challenger tractor line 
we issued approximately million shares of common stock in the transaction valued at approximately million based on the closing price of our common stock on the acquisition date 
during july  we received approximately million from caterpillar pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement  whereby any proceeds caterpillar received upon the sale of our stock above million would be refunded to us 
in addition  we purchased approximately million of initial production inventory from caterpillar in connection with a supply agreement with caterpillar 
the addition of the challenger tractor line provides us with a technological leader in high horsepower track type tractors that will be marketed on a worldwide basis primarily through the caterpillar distribution organization 
furthermore  we will provide caterpillar dealers with additional products that will broaden their equipment offerings and enhance their competitive position 
the challenger acquisition was accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 and accordingly  the purchase price has been allocated to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on a preliminary estimate of fair values as of the acquisition date 
on march   we announced the closure of our track tractor facility in dekalb  illinois 
currently  the dekalb plant assembles challenger track tractors in the range of to horsepower 
after a review of cost reduction alternatives  it was determined the current and forecasted production levels were not sufficient to support a stand alone track tractor site 
we are evaluating the relocation of production to our current facilities in hesston  kansas or jackson  minnesota 
production at the dekalb facility is planned to cease by late may with production to be relocated and resumed in july at march   there were employees at the dekalb plant 
we anticipate that the facility rationalization will generate annual savings of approximately million by the year the estimated cash closure costs of approximately million are expected to be recovered from proceeds from the sale of the dekalb site 
on april   we completed the acquisition of ag chem  a manufacturer and distributor of self propelled sprayers 
we paid ag chem shareholders approximately million consisting of approximately million agco common shares and million of cash 
the funding of the cash component of the purchase price was made through borrowings under our revolving credit facility 

table of contents the ag chem acquisition was accounted for as a purchase in accordance with accounting principles board apb no 
 business combinations  and accordingly the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their fair values as of the acquisition date 
in connection with the acquisition of ag chem  we established million in liabilities primarily related to severance  employee relocation and other costs associated with the planned closure of ag chem s benson  minnesota manufacturing facility  minnetonka  minnesota administrative office and fifteen parts and service facilities 
during the first quarter of  all costs in connection with the liabilities established had been incurred 
accordingly  we adjusted our purchase price allocation to reflect a reduction in these established liabilities by million 
in addition  we finalized our purchase price allocation resulting in a net total goodwill adjustment of approximately million 
the adjustment primarily related to the reflection of final appraised values of property  plant and equipment acquired and the establishment of certain liabilities related to outstanding litigation and warranty obligations 
restructuring and other infrequent expenses during the second quarter of  we announced and initiated a restructuring plan related to the closure of our tractor manufacturing facility in coventry  england and the relocation of existing production at coventry to our beauvais  france and canoas  brazil manufacturing facilities 
the closure of this facility is consistent with our strategy to reduce excess manufacturing capacity 
the closure should also aid in eliminating the negative impact of currency factors and significantly lower product and operating costs 
the facility manufactured transaxles and assembled tractors in the range of horsepower 
the trend to higher horsepower tractors resulting from the consolidation of farms had caused this product segment of the industry to decline over recent years  which negatively impacted the facility s utilization 
we anticipate that we will generate annual savings of million to million as a result of this rationalization  to be fully realized in in connection with the restructuring plan  we have recorded approximately million of restructuring and other infrequent expenses during the components of the restructuring expenses are summarized in the following table in millions write down of property  employee facility plant and employee retention closure equipment severance payments costs total provision less non cash expense cash expense cash activity balances as of december  the severance costs relate to the termination of approximately  employees  following the completion of production in the coventry facility 
approximately employees had been terminated as of december  the employee retention payments relate to incentives paid to coventry employees who remain employed until certain future termination dates and are accrued over the term of the retention period 
the facility closure costs include certain noncancelable operating lease termination and other facility exit costs 
the write down of property  plant and equipment represents the impairment of machinery and equipment resulting from the facility closure and was based on the estimated fair value of the assets compared to their carrying value 
the estimated fair value of the equipment was determined based on current conditions in the market 
the machinery  equipment and tooling will be disposed of after production ceases and the buildings  land and improvements will be marketed for sale 
the million of restructuring costs accrued at december  are expected to be incurred during we also recorded approximately million of inventory reserves during reflected in costs of goods sold related to inventory that was identified as obsolete as a result of the closure 
we expect to incur an additional to million of restructuring expenses in related to the coventry closure 

table of contents in october  we applied to the high court in london  england  for clarification of a rule in its uk pension plan that governs the value of pension payments payable to an employee who is over years old and who retires from service in certain circumstances prior to his normal retirement date 
the primary matter before the high court was whether pension payments to such employees  including those terminated due to the closure of our coventry facility  should be reduced to compensate for the fact that the pension payments begin prior to normal retirement age of on december   the high court ruled against our position that reduced pension payments are payable in the context of early retirements or terminations 
the high court s ruling also granted us approval to appeal the judgment in the court of appeal 
we and our advisors maintain the view that reduced pension payments should be payable and  as a result  have appealed the judgment to the court of appeal 
under the appeal process in england  a panel of judges who had no involvement with the high court proceedings will hear the appeal and determine the outcome on its merits 
a majority ruling of the court of appeal judges is required to overturn the original high court decision 
based upon advice of our legal advisors  we have reassessed the merits of our case in consideration of the high court ruling and maintain the opinion that the likelihood of an unfavorable resolution to this matter is reasonably possible  but do not consider it to be probable 
consequently  we have not recorded a loss as of december  related to this matter 
in the event that our position is not ultimately upheld  the closure of our coventry facility and past early retirement programs would entitle certain terminated employees to receive unreduced pension payments 
the estimated impact to our pension plan would be an increase in our pension plan liabilities of approximately million to million and a related charge to our consolidated statements of operations 
we presently estimate that additional funding to the pension plan related to this increased liability would be approximately million per annum for the next years 
the timing of our obligation to fund cash into the pension plan with respect to this increased liability would depend on many factors including the overall funded status of the plan and the investment returns of the plan s assets 
we recorded additional restructuring and other infrequent expenses of million during the expense primarily relates to severance costs and certain lease termination and other exit costs associated with the rationalization of our european engineering and marketing personnel  certain components of our german manufacturing facilities located in kempten and marktoberdorf  germany and the restructuring of our north american information systems function 
these rationalizations were completed to improve our on going cost structure and reduce cost of goods sold  as well as engineering and selling  general and administrative expenses 
the million of severance costs recorded associated with these activities relate to the termination of employees in total 
at december   approximately million of the amount accrued had been incurred 
the remaining balance of million is expected to be incurred during in  we announced our plans to rationalize certain facilities as part of the ag chem acquisition integration 
we consolidated agco s willmar  minnesota manufacturing facility and ag chem s benson  minnesota manufacturing facility into ag chem s jackson  minnesota manufacturing plant 
in addition  we closed ag chem s minnetonka  minnesota administrative offices and relocated all functions to the jackson facility 
we also closed parts and service facilities and integrated parts warehousing and logistics into agco s north american parts distribution system 
these closures were completed in order to achieve an overall reduction of cost of goods sold and operating expenses for the combined businesses 
we believe that all key aspects of the restructuring plan were successfully executed 
the targeted synergies of approximately million were offset by a decline in industry demand  which impacted our sales  production levels and cost structure 
all employees identified in the restructuring plan had been terminated as of the end of the first quarter of employee retention payments related to incentives paid to ag chem and agco employees who remained employed until certain future termination dates were accrued over the term of the retention period 
we incurred facility closure costs  which included employee relocation costs and other exit costs at our willmar location after operations ceased 
the facility relocation and transition costs were expensed as incurred and represented costs to relocate inventory and machinery and costs to integrate operations into the remaining 
table of contents facilities 
there are no remaining costs accrued related to these rationalizations as of december  the components of the restructuring expenses are summarized in the following table in millions write down facility of property  employee facility relocation plant and employee retention closure and transition equipment severance payments costs costs total provision less non cash expense cash expense cash activity balances as of december  provision reversal of provision cash activity balances as of december  in  we permanently closed our combine manufacturing facility in independence  missouri and our lockney  texas and noetinger  argentina implement manufacturing facilities 
in  we permanently closed our coldwater  ohio manufacturing facility 
the majority of production in these facilities has been relocated to existing facilities or outsourced to third parties 
the closure of these facilities was consistent with our strategy to reduce excess manufacturing capacity 
due to declines in industry demand since  we determined that closure of these facilities and redeployment of the majority of production to other existing facilities and the remaining production to third party suppliers was necessary to address the excess capacity in our us and south american manufacturing plants 
the manufacturing facility rationalization resulted in significant cost savings and improved the overall competitiveness of implements  hay equipment  high horsepower tractors and combines produced in these plants 
the rationalization of these production facilities is expected to continue to generate annual cost savings of million to million from the elimination of production overhead costs and other efficiencies 
we believe these efficiencies were substantially achieved in and we expensed approximately million and million associated with these rationalizations during and  respectively  and had million of costs accrued related to these rationalizations as of december  we did not record any additional restructuring and other infrequent expenses in related to these closures 
we incurred approximately million of expenses during the remaining accrued restructuring costs of million primarily relate to noncancelable lease termination costs and will be incurred through in addition  during  we sold our closed manufacturing facilities in independence  missouri and coldwater  ohio 
a net gain on the sale of these two facilities of million was reflected in restructuring and other infrequent expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
in the preparation of these financial statements  we make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the significant accounting policies followed in the preparation of the financial statements are detailed in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we believe that our application of policies regarding the establishment of allowances for accounts receivable  inventories  valuation allowances for deferred tax assets and certain accrued expenses for warranty  insurance and sales incentives involve significant levels of judgments  estimates and complexity 
allowances for discounts and sales incentives are made at the time of sale based on retail sales incentive programs available to the dealer or retail customer 
the cost of these programs is dependent on various 
table of contents factors including the timing of the retail sale and the volume of sales achieved by the dealer 
these retail sales incentives may also be revised between the time we record the sale and the time the retail sale occurs 
we monitor these factors and revise our provisions when necessary 
our allowances for surplus and obsolete inventory are based on estimates of future sales and production 
changes in demand and product design can impact these estimates 
we periodically evaluate and update our assumptions when assessing the adequacy of inventory allowances 
valuation allowances for deferred tax assets are established when we estimate it is more likely than not that the tax assets will not be realized 
these estimates are based on projections of future income  including tax planning strategies  in certain tax jurisdictions 
changes in industry conditions and the competitive environment may impact the accuracy of our projections 
provisions for estimated expenses related to product warranties are made at the time products are sold 
these estimates are based on historical experience of the nature  frequency and average cost of warranty claims 
we frequently review warranty trends to monitor our estimates and develop actions to minimize future claims 
insurance reserves are provided for our estimates of losses due to claims for worker s compensation  product liability and other liabilities for which we are self insured 
these estimates are based on the ultimate value of claims  which often have long periods of resolution 
we closely monitor the claims to maintain adequate reserves 
we are party to various claims and lawsuits arising in the normal course of business 
we closely monitor these claims and lawsuits and frequently consult with our legal counsel to determine whether or not they may  when resolved  have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
as discussed previously  in october  we applied to the high court in london  england  for clarification of a rule in its uk pension plan that governs the value of pension payments payable to an employee who is over years old and who retires from service in certain circumstances prior to his normal retirement date 
in december  the high court ruled against our position that reduced pension payments are payable in the context of early retirements or terminations 
the high court s ruling also granted us approval to appeal the judgment in the court of appeal 
based upon advice of our legal advisors  we reassessed the merits of our case in consideration of the high court ruling and maintain the opinion that the likelihood of an unfavorable resolution to this matter is reasonably possible  but do not consider it to be probable 
consequently  we have not recorded a loss as of december  related to this matter 
in the event that our position is not ultimately upheld  the closure of our coventry facility and past early retirement programs would entitle certain terminated employees to receive unreduced pension payments 
the estimated impact to our pension plan would be an increase in our pension plan liabilities of approximately million to million and a related charge to our consolidated statements of operations 
the goodwill and indefinite lived trademarks in each of our segments were tested for impairment as of january  as required by sfas no 
sfas no 
established a new method of testing goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
this assessment involves determining an estimate of the fair value of our reporting units including trademarks in order to evaluate whether an impairment of the current carrying amount of goodwill and other intangible assets exists 
fair values are derived based on an evaluation of past and expected future performance of our reporting units 
we utilized a combination of valuation techniques including a discounted cash flow approach  a market multiple approach and a comparable transaction approach 
based on our initial evaluation as of january   we determined that goodwill in two of our reporting units was impaired and recorded a write down of goodwill recognized as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first quarter of we conducted our annual analysis as of october   and determined no further reduction in the carrying amount of goodwill was required in we closely monitor any circumstances that could potentially impact the fair value of our reporting units 

table of contents due to the level of judgment  complexity and period of time over which many of these items are resolved  actual results could differ from those estimated at the time of preparation of the financial statements 
adjustments to these estimates would impact our financial position and future results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources our financing requirements are subject to variations due to seasonal changes in inventory and receivable levels 
internally generated funds are supplemented when necessary from external sources  primarily our revolving credit facility and accounts receivable securitization facilities 
our primary financing and funding sources are the million senior subordinated notes due  the million senior notes due  a million revolving credit facility and approximately million of accounts receivable securitization facilities in the us  canada and europe 
our million multi currency revolving credit facility with rabobank matures in october the facility is secured by a majority of our us  canadian and us based assets and a pledge of a portion of the stock of our domestic and material foreign subsidiaries 
interest accrues on borrowings outstanding under the facility  at our option  at either libor plus a margin based on a ratio of our senior debt to ebitda  as adjusted  or the administrative agent s base lending rate or the federal funds rate plus a margin ranging between and  whichever is higher 
the facility contains covenants  including covenants restricting the incurrence of indebtedness and the making of restrictive payments  including dividends 
in addition  the facility contains financial covenants including  among others  a total debt to ebitda ratio  a senior debt to ebitda ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio  as defined in the facility 
on march  we amended our revolving credit facility agreement to allow the ltip cash expense to be recognized evenly over four quarters for purposes of calculating ebitda under certain financial covenants 
the facility was also amended on december  to change the required ratios for the total debt to ebitda and senior debt to ebitda covenants 
at december   we had borrowings of million and availability to borrow million under the revolving credit facility 
we issued million of senior notes due the senior notes in the senior notes are unsecured obligations and are redeemable at our option  in whole or in part  commencing may  initially at of their principal amount  plus accrued interest  declining to of their principal amount plus accrued interest on may  the indenture governing the senior notes requires us to offer to repurchase the senior notes at of their principal amount  plus accrued interest to the date of the repurchase in the event of a change in control 
the indenture contains certain covenants that among other things  limits our ability and that of its restricted subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness  make restricted payments including dividends and share repurchases  make investments  guarantee indebtedness  create liens  and sell assets and share repurchases 
we issued million of senior subordinated notes due the senior subordinated notes in at of their principal amount 
the senior subordinated notes are unsecured obligations and are redeemable at our option  in whole or in part  at any time on or after march  initially at of their principal amount  plus accrued interest  declining ratably to of their principal amount plus accrued interest  on or after march  the senior subordinated notes include certain covenants restricting the incurrence of indebtedness and the making of certain restrictive payments  including dividends 
under our securitization facilities  we sell accounts receivable on a revolving basis to commercial paper conduits either on a direct basis or through a wholly owned special purpose entity 
as of december   the unpaid balance of receivables sold was approximately million  of which funding of million had been advanced to us 
the funded balance of million has the effect of reducing accounts receivable and short term liabilities by the same amount 
our risk of loss under the securitization facilities is limited to a portion of the unfunded balance of receivables sold which is approximately of the funded amount 
we maintain reserves for doubtful accounts associated with this risk 
if the facilities were terminated  we would not be required to repurchase previously sold receivables but would be prevented from selling additional receivables to the commercial paper conduit 
the agreements provide that the agent  rabobank  has the right 
table of contents to terminate the arrangement if our senior unsecured debt rating moves below b by standard poor s or b by moody s investor services 
based on our current ratings  a downgrade of three levels by standard poor s and two levels by moody s would need to occur 
our accounts receivable securitization facilities in the united states  canada and europe total approximately million as of december  in  we completed million of securitization facilities for the sale of certain european and canadian wholesale accounts receivable to a third party on a revolving basis 
in  we completed a million securitization facility for the sale of united states accounts receivables on a revolving basis 
we meet our short term liquidity requirements through utilization of our revolving credit facility and the accounts receivable securitization facilities 
our revolving credit facility is committed through october and is subject to maintaining certain covenants as described above 
the securitization facilities each have terms of five years but are subject to annual renewal 
these facilities allow us to sell accounts receivables through financing conduits which obtain funding from commercial paper markets 
future funding under securitization facilities is dependent upon the adequacy of receivables  a sufficient demand for the underlying commercial paper and the maintenance of certain covenants concerning the quality of the receivables and our financial condition 
in the event commercial paper demand is not adequate  our securitization facilities provide for liquidity backing from various financial institutions including rabobank 
these liquidity commitments would provide us with interim funding and should allow us time to find alternative sources of working capital financing  if necessary 
our working capital requirements are seasonal  with investments in working capital typically building in the first half of the year and then reducing in the second half of the year 
we had million of working capital at december   an increase of million from working capital of million at december  accounts receivable and inventory combined were million higher than the prior year 
the change includes approximately million of receivables and inventory related to the challenger product line introduction and sunflower acquisition 
the net change in receivables and inventory  excluding these items is an increase of approximately million compared to december  the increase is predominantly due to foreign currency translation 
cash flows provided by operating activities were million for compared to million for operating cash flows in benefited from an additional million in receivables securitization funding 
excluding these securitization impacts  operating cash flow was comparable to operating cash flows in were impacted by the initial investment in working capital related to the challenger product line introduction of approximately million 
capital expenditures for were million compared to million for the increase in capital expenditures was primarily due to new product offerings  systems improvements and the challenger acquisition 
we anticipate that capital expenditures for will range from approximately million to million and will primarily be used to support the development and enhancement of new and existing products as well as facility  equipment and systems improvements 
our debt to capitalization ratio total long term debt divided by the sum of total long term debt and stockholders equity was at december  compared to at december  the increase is primarily attributable to higher debt incurred in connection with the challenger working capital investment and sunflower acquisition and the reduction in equity in we believe that available borrowings under the revolving credit facility  funding under the accounts receivable securitization facilities  available cash and internally generated funds will be sufficient to support our working capital  capital expenditures and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future 
from time to time  we review and will continue to review acquisition and joint venture opportunities as well as changes in the capital markets 
if we were to consummate a significant acquisition or elect to take advantage of favorable opportunities in the capital markets  we may supplement availability or revise the terms under our credit facilities or complete public or private offerings of equity or debt securities 

table of contents contractual commitments the future payments required under our significant contractual obligations  excluding foreign currency forward contracts  as of december  are as follows in millions payments due by period to to and total beyond long term debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations unconditional purchase obligations other long term obligations total contractual cash obligations unconditional purchase obligations exclude routine purchase orders in the normal course of business

we also maintain a remarketing agreement with these joint ventures  whereby we are obligated to repurchase repossessed inventory at market values 
management believes that any losses  which might be incurred on the resale of this equipment  will not materially impact our financial position or results of operations 
at december   we guaranteed indebtedness owed to third parties of approximately million  primarily related to dealer and end user financing of equipment 
we believe the credit risk associated with these guarantees is not material to our financial position 
other in addition  at december   we had outstanding foreign currency forward contracts of approximately million 
all contracts have a maturity of less than one year

related parties rabobank nederland  a aaa rated financial institution based in the netherlands  is a owner in our retail finance joint ventures which are located in the united states  canada  the united kingdom  france  germany  spain  ireland and brazil 
rabobank is also the principal agent and participant in our revolving credit facility and our securitization facilities 
the majority of the assets of our retail finance joint ventures represent finance receivables 
the majority of the liabilities represent notes payable and accrued interest 
under the various joint venture agreements  rabobank or its affiliates are obligated to provide financing to the joint venture companies  primarily through lines of credit 
we do not guarantee the obligations of the retail finance joint ventures other than of the solvency requirements of the brazil joint venture 
in brazil  our 
table of contents joint venture company has an agency relationship with rabobank whereby rabobank provides funding 
the funding is provided entirely through government sponsored finame facilities which are subject to variation at any time by the brazilian government 
our retail finance joint ventures provide retail financing and wholesale financing to our dealers 
the terms of the financing arrangements offered to our dealers are similar to arrangements they provide to unaffiliated third parties 
as discussed previously  at december  we were obligated under certain circumstances to purchase through the year up to million of equipment upon expiration of certain operating leases between agco finance llc and agco finance canada ltd  our retail joint ventures in north america  and end users 
we also maintain a remarketing agreement with these joint ventures  discussed under contractual commitments 
in addition  as part of sales incentives provided to end users  we may from time to time subsidize interest rates of retail financing provided by our retail joint ventures 
the cost of those programs is recognized at the time of sale to our dealers 
during  we had net sales of million to baywa corporation  a german distributor  in the ordinary course of business 
the president and ceo of baywa corporation is also a member of our board of directors 
during  we purchased approximately million of equipment components from our manufacturing joint venture  gima  at cost 
during  we also purchased approximately million of equipment components from our manufacturing joint venture  deutz agco motores sa  at prices approximating cost 
outlook our operations are subject to the cyclical nature of the agricultural industry 
sales of our equipment have been and are expected to continue to be affected by changes in net cash farm income  farm land values  weather conditions  the demand for agricultural commodities  farm industry related legislation and general economic conditions 
worldwide demand for farm equipment in is expected to remain relatively level with in north america  higher commodity prices and a generally favorable farm bill should support higher farm income in while current demand in north america remains soft due to dry conditions in portions of north america and transition issues with support payments  retail demand in north america is expected to improve modestly throughout the year 
in western europe  industry demand rebounded in reflecting a recovery from livestock disease concerns 
industry demand in western europe is expected to remain relatively level in although concerns over common agricultural policy changes may impact some markets 
in south america  industry demand has been at relatively high levels over the past two years due to the availability of financing support in brazil 
in  subsidized financing is also expected to be available in brazil but initially not at the same levels as as a result  south american industry demand is anticipated to be lower in than our current outlook does not anticipate disruptions to demand or our operations caused by the current global political environment or potential future conflicts in the middle east 
based on this current market outlook  agco expects earnings to improve in resulting from sales growth  improved operating margins and a reduction in restructuring expenses 
agco s net sales are expected to increase in with growth to be achieved from the challenger product line introduction  the addition of sunflower  the impact of new product introductions  and the strengthening of the euro 
operating margins are expected to improve from cost reduction initiatives  new product offerings  factory rationalizations and product mix 
offsetting these benefits will be higher pension costs  which are expected to increase by approximately million on a pre tax basis 
restructuring expenses related to the coventry closure are expected to be approximately million to million on a pre tax basis 
foreign currency risk management we have significant manufacturing operations in the united states  the united kingdom  france  germany  denmark and brazil  and we purchase a portion of our tractors  combines and components from third party foreign suppliers  primarily in various european countries and in japan 
we also sell products in 
table of contents over countries throughout the world 
the majority of our revenue outside the united states is denominated in the currency of the customer location with the exception of sales in the middle east  africa and asia  which is primarily denominated in british pounds  euros or us dollars see segment reporting in the notes to consolidated financial statements for sales by customer location 
our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are the british pound in relation to the euro and the british pound  euro  brazilian real and the canadian dollar in relation to the us dollar 
fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies create exposures  which can adversely affect our results of operations 
we attempt to manage our transactional foreign exchange exposure by hedging foreign currency cash flow forecasts and commitments arising from the settlement of receivables and payables  and from future purchases and sales 
where naturally offsetting currency positions do not occur  we hedge certain of our exposures through the use of foreign currency forward contracts 
our hedging policy prohibits foreign currency forward contracts for speculative trading purposes 
our translation exposure resulting from translating the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries into us dollars is not hedged 
our most significant translation exposures are the british pound  the euro and the brazilian real in relation to the us dollar 
when practical  this translation impact is reduced by financing local operations with local borrowings 
the following is a summary of foreign currency forward contracts used to hedge currency exposures 
all contracts have a maturity of less than one year 
the net notional amounts and fair value gains or losses as of december  stated in us dollars are as follows in millions  except average contract rate net notional average fair amount contract value buy sell rate gain loss australian dollar british pound canadian dollar danish krone euro dollar japanese yen mexican peso norwegian krone south african rand swedish krona per us dollar because these contracts were entered into for hedging purposes  the gains and losses on the contracts would largely be offset by gains and losses on the underlying firm commitment 
interest rates we manage interest rate risk through the use of fixed rate debt and may in the future utilize interest rate swap contracts 
we have fixed rate debt from our million senior subordinated notes due and our million senior notes due our floating rate exposure is related to our revolving credit facility and our securitization facilities  which are tied to changes in us and european libor rates 
assuming a increase in interest rates  interest expense  net for  would have increased by approximately million 
during  we had an interest rate swap contract outstanding to further minimize the effect of potential interest rate increases on floating rate debt 
this contract expired on december  and we had no interest rate swap contracts outstanding in 
table of contents accounting changes on january   we adopted sfas no 
sfas no 
requires companies to cease amortizing goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets on december  that were in existence at june  any goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets resulting from acquisitions completed after june  will not be amortized 
sfas no 
also establishes a new method of testing goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
sfas no 
requires that an initial impairment assessment be performed on all goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
this assessment involves determining an estimate of the fair value of our reporting units and trademarks in order to evaluate whether an impairment of the current carrying amount of goodwill and other intangible assets exists 
fair values are derived based on an evaluation of past and expected future performance of our reporting units 
the adoption of sfas no 
resulted in a reduction of amortization expense of approximately million during compared to refer to note in our consolidated financial statements 
the goodwill in each of our segments was tested for impairment as of january  as required by sfas no 
we utilized a combination of valuation techniques including a discounted cash flow approach  a market multiple approach and a comparable transaction approach 
based on this evaluation  we determined that goodwill associated with our argentine and north american reporting units was impaired 
as a result  we recorded a pre tax write down of goodwill of million 
this write down was recognized as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of million  net of million of taxes  in the first quarter of in july  the fasb also issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas no 

sfas no 
requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred 
when the liability is initially recorded  the entity capitalizes the cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
over time  the liability is accreted to its present value each period and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
upon settlement of the liability  the entity either settles the obligation for the amount recorded or incurs a gain or loss 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we are evaluating the effect of this statement on our results of operations and financial position  but do not believe the impact will be material 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

sfas no 
supersedes fasb statement no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas no

the fasb issued sfas no 
to establish a single accounting model  based on the framework established in sfas no 
 for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale 
sfas no 
broadens the presentation of discontinued operations in the statement of operations to include a component of an entity rather than a segment of a business 
a component of an entity comprises operations and cash flows that can be clearly distinguished  operationally and for financial reporting purposes  from the rest of the entity 
sfas no 
also requires that discontinued operations be measured at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
we adopted sfas no

refer to note in our consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no

 and technical corrections sfas no 

sfas no 
eliminates the requirement under sfas no 
 reporting gains and losses from extinguishment of debt  to report gains and losses from extinguishments of debt as extraordinary items in the income statement 
accordingly  gains or losses from extinguishments of debt for fiscal years beginning after may  shall not be reported as 
table of contents extraordinary items unless the extinguishment qualifies as an extraordinary item under the provisions of apb opinion no 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 any gain or loss on extinguishment of debt previously classified as an extraordinary item in prior periods presented that does not meet the criteria of apb opinion no 
for such classification should be reclassified to conform with the provisions of sfas no 
sfas no 
also amends sfas no 
 accounting for leases  to eliminate an inconsistency between the required accounting for sale leaseback transactions and the required accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar to sale leaseback transactions 
in addition  sfas no 
amends other existing authoritative pronouncements to make various technical corrections  clarify meanings  or describe their applicability under changed conditions 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after may  we are evaluating the effect of this statement on our results of operations and financial position  but do not believe the impact will be material 
the new standard will require us to reclassify the extraordinary loss recorded in to interest expense  net which will result in a reduction in income before extraordinary loss by per share but will have no impact on net income or stockholders equity 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas no 

sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under eitf issue no 
 a liability for an exit cost as defined in the issue was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
therefore  sfas no 
eliminates the definition and requirements for recognition of exit costs in eitf issue no 
 and also establishes that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability 
sfas no 
is effective for all exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  sfas no 
does not impact our current restructuring plans related to the closure of the coventry  england manufacturing facility 
we will comply with this statement for any future exit or disposal activities

 recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  fin 
fin requires that the guarantor recognize  at the inception of certain guarantees  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing such guarantee 
fin also requires additional disclosure about the guarantor s obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  and the disclosure requirements are effective after december  and are included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
 sfas no 

sfas no 
amends sfas no 
to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results
