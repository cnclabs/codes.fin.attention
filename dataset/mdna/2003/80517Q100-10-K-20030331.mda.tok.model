puricase gout occurs when uric acid accumulates in the joints 
the disease causes severe pain and disability and creates a risk of kidney failure  which may lead to life threatening complications 
current treatments for gout and related conditions are sometimes ineffective because of side effects or lack of efficacy of approved medications 
peg uricase is a chemically modified enzyme of mammalian origin that converts uric acid to a more soluble and readily excreted product 
the peg modified enzyme has a much longer circulating lifetime and is less likely to induce immune reactions than the unmodified enzyme 
therefore  the peg uricase enzyme should effectively and efficiently eliminate excess uric acid from the body of individuals who cannot otherwise excrete excess uric acid 
in august btg licensed exclusive worldwide rights from duke university medical center duke of north carolina and mountain view pharmaceuticals  inc mvp to technology relating to polyethylene glycol peg conjugates of uricase urate oxidase 
duke had developed recombinant uricases and  together with mvp  had developed peg conjugates of uricases to make them safer and longer acting 
mvp has transferred its peg technology to btg  and we will produce uricase and peg conjugates of uricase  undertake clinical trials and commercialize the product 
we filed an ind with the fda in november and the phase i clinical trial  utilizing delivery by subcutaneous injection  started in february at duke university medical center 
while a dose dependent reduction in serum uric acid levels was noted in the trial  topical hypersensitivity reactions in some individuals participating in the study were also observed 
we initiated a new phase i clinical trial in the first quarter of utilizing an intravenous route of administration to determine whether these reactions could thereby be avoided 
fibrimage thrombus imaging agent fibrimage formerly called imagex is a novel agent for the detection of thrombi and blood clots in patients suffering from deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism 
deep vein thrombosis  which results from the development of thrombi  causes a reduction in the venous blood flow 
pulmonary embolism is the dislodgment of a piece of thrombus and its relocation via the circulatory system to the lungs 
fibrimage consists of a genetically engineered portion of the fibrin binding domain of fibronectin attached to a radiopharmaceutical tag 
once injected in the patient  it targets and binds to fibrin  a substance that is essentially present only in blood clots 
btg holds various patents covering fibrimage in the united states and in several other countries 
in august  we licensed worldwide rights to the polypeptide to merck frosst canada inc merck frosst for the development and commercialization of a diagnostic imaging agent for the detection of thromboembolism 
merck frosst filed an application for an investigational new drug ind with the canadian bureau of biologics in april in september draxis health inc draxis acquired the radio pharmaceutical division of merck frosst and all rights to fibrimage 
draxis successfully completed a phase i study of fibrimage in canada in december  and a phase ii study in although draxis planned to initiate a phase iii efficacy study in canada in february  the study was placed on hold pending resolution of formulation issues 
draxis currently expects to initiate the phase iii study in both canada and the us during oral liquid pharmaceutical products rosemont s strategy is to launch products as specials  then conduct bioequivalence and stability studies to gain licensure for those products that generate sufficient sales to warrant the expense 
this process generally requires two to three years 
rosemont maintains an in house development capability to develop new products

products in laboratory and pre clinical research btg btg is developing btg  based on a human antibody fragment  termed y  which targets a cell surface antigen with specific preference to malignant myeloid cells 
btg believes the antibody  coupled to a cytotoxic agent  may be useful as a first line therapy during remission and as a second line therapy to treat relapsed and refractory acute myeloid leukemia aml patients 
currently  treatment practice for newly diagnosed aml patients is uniform and highly effective at induction of remission 
however  significant unmet medical need exists for therapies that prolong remission and are effective for refractory and relapsed patients 
btg is being developed in response to their needs 
btg will require patent licenses from a number of companies in order to commercialize btg btg is currently in advanced discussions with one licensor 
we cannot assure you that we will able to obtain these licenses on reasonable terms or at all 
if we are not able to obtain these licenses  we will not be able to commercialize btg in addition to aml cells  btg binding was demonstrated in b cell related malignancies  including multiple myeloma mm  indicating its potential clinical utility in other indications such as other sub types of leukemia and metastatic tumors 
y possibly may be useful as a diagnostic agent prior to patient treatment  since of aml patients are y reactive 
biogenerica tm pursuant to an agreement entered into with teva pharmaceutical industries ltd 
in  btg is currently pursuing the development of two recombinant human therapeutic proteins chosen by teva that are currently marketed worldwide by other companies and which are approaching the end of their patent protection in a number of countries 
under the agreement  btg is responsible for conducting all development work on the biologic products and manufacturing 
teva will distribute and market the products once regulatory approvals have been obtained 
it is likely that clinical trials will be required in order to obtain approval of these products  and btg is obligated to pay one half the cost of the trials  which costs may be significant 
btg received a milestone payment of  in and will receive up to an additional  in milestone payments and a royalty based on teva s net sales of products 
oxsodrol human superoxide dismutase during  we terminated our development efforts with respect to our oxsodrol  a product we were developing for the prevention of chronic respiratory morbidity  or lung injury  in premature babies 
btg had developed a process for manufacturing a fully active analog of human copper zinc superoxide dismutase sod  which neutralizes oxygen free radicals 
many premature babies are deficient in naturally occurring sod  and the high concentrations of oxygen that premature babies require are believed to be involved in generating excess oxygen free radicals in the lungs  causing permanent lung injury at the cellular level 
btg s phase iii clinical efficacy and safety trial related to the use of sod to prevent bronchopulmonary dysplasia bpd  a chronic lung disease that develops following treatment with oxygen and mechanical ventilation of premature infants who experience respiratory distress  revealed no reduction in the combined incidence of bpd and death at days in neonates treated with oxsodrol  although preliminary data from earlier phase i investigations suggested a delayed protective effect in neonates treated with oxsodrol 
as a result  btg  in consultation with the fda  continued the trial as a phase ii study with preservation of blinded treatment assignments 
the incidence of pulmonary and neurologic complications in the placebo and oxsodrol treated groups was assessed at one year corrected postnatal age 
this follow up study revealed a reduction in the incidence of reactive airways ie  asthma in the oxsodrol treated babies 
in january  we licensed oxsodrol to jcr for the treatment of bpd in japan and  in august  we licensed worldwide distribution rights excluding the united states  canada  israel and japan for oxsodrol for the treatment of bronchopulmonary dysplasia and other respiratory indications to ares trading sa  a member of the ares serono group 
jcr has expressed an interest in continuing with the bpd indication 
in august  serono elected not to continue its participation in the development of oxsodrol 
btg may seek to determine whether there is any third party interest in the acquisition of oxsodrol rights outside japan 
sales and distribution we market oxandrin and delatestryl primarily on a direct basis in the united states  our oral liquid pharmaceutical products on a direct basis in the united kingdom and our products on a direct basis in israel 
we grant exclusive marketing or distribution rights to third parties for sales of our other products in the united states and for sales of all our products in most other countries 
our sales and marketing team in the united states  which we established in the second half of  consisted of people on february  rosemont s sales and marketing team consisted of people on february  with respect to sales outside the united states  btg s current distribution arrangements include exclusive relationships with jcr for the sale of bio tropin in japan and the people s republic of china  with ferring for the sale of bio tropin in europe and the former soviet union  with several other companies  covering approximately countries  for the sale of bio tropin  approximately companies  covering more than countries  for the sale of biolon  galderma for the sale of silkis worldwide  and depuy for the sale of arthrease in all countries worldwide other than israel and japan 
btg has granted teva exclusive marketing rights to its hgh in the united states  which teva will market as tev tropin tm  and have granted akorn inc exclusive marketing rights for biolon in the united states 
in substantially all of btg s product distribution agreements  btg grants exclusive marketing and distribution rights in one or more countries in exchange for upfront license payments and exclusive supply arrangements 
pursuant to these agreements  btg generally supplies product at a price equal to a percentage of the distributor s net sales price  subject to a minimum price 
regulatory approvals are obtained either by btg or by its distributors  depending on the product  the territory and the terms of the commercial agreement 
btg is generally obligated to indemnify the distributor for product liability claims resulting from the failure of supplied product to meet agreed upon specifications and infringement of third party patents 
see risk factors we are dependent on third party licensees to commercialize many of our products  and their failure to perform adequately could adversely affect our results of operations 
in connection with the introduction of oxandrin  btg entered into an agreement with gentiva health services  inc  which was subsequently acquired by accredo health  incorporated accredo  whereby accredo served as btg s exclusive wholesale distributor of btg s oxandrin and delatestryl products in the united states 
sales of oxandrin in  and were primarily to accredo 
see risk factors we are dependent on oxandrin sales for a significant portion of our revenue  and any decrease in oxandrin sales could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to conduct our business 
in the fourth quarter of btg renegotiated its agreement with accredo  and btg now sells oxandrin and delatestryl directly to wholesalers and accredo distributes them for btg on a fee for service basis 
accredo earns management fees from btg for certain services it provides  such as warehousing and shipping of product 
in anticipation of the change in its distribution agreement with accredo  btg established direct relationships with key wholesalers 
btg began selling the mg tablet directly to wholesalers in september accredo will continue to distribute the mg oxandrin tablets in its inventory until they complete the liquidation of their inventory position  which we anticipate will occur by the end of march btg s sales of oxandrin in the first quarter of will be determined in part by the effect of the working down of accredo s available supply of the mg tablets 
in may btg signed an agreement with ross to co market oxandrin in the united states for the long term care market  which represented approximately of oxandrin retail sales  based upon scripts  in both and ross has the right to terminate the agreement at any time upon six months notice 
if ross elects to do so  our oxandrin sales could be adversely affected until we are able to replace the ross sales force  which we may not be able to do successfully 
btg has the right to terminate the agreement at the end of if ross does not meet specified sales levels 
research and development we conduct research on potential products for which we have retained future rights for our own account and on behalf of our partners for which we receive certain current payments and  if successful  future payments in the form of royalties or manufacturing rights 
at february   our research and development organization comprised scientists  associates and related personnel with expertise in molecular biology  cell biology  protein chemistry and clinical trials 
our principal products in research and development are as follows product indication application status products in registration and clinical trials prosaptide tm treatment of neuropathic pain phase ii puricase severe gout phase i fibrimage thrombus imaging agent diagnosis of deep vein thrombus phase iii being conducted by draxis oral liquid pharmaceutical products oral liquid formulations of medicines bio equivalence and stability studies products in laboratory and pre clinical research biogenerica generic versions of two biologic pharmaceutical products pre clinical development btg leukemia research for further information about these products  see products in registration and clinical trials and products in laboratory and pre clinical research 
in light of the long research and development timelines associated with pharmaceutical research  as well as the high risks and costs involved  we have determined to move away from funding internal discovery research 
instead  we intend to focus on recruiting promising later stage research projects by in licensing therapeutics and technologies from external sources and pursuing multiple early stage collaborations that have the potential to provide new products in oncology  neurobiology or other niche indications 
we will focus our internal research expertise and resources on the advancement or refinement of existing compounds or in licensed product candidates 
rosemont does not engage in any basic research activities 
however  rosemont possesses a high degree of skill in converting drugs from tablet formulation to oral liquid formulations 
the process generally requires six months  with another three months required for stability 
when sales of these newly developed products reach a desired level  rosemont will commence bioequivalency and stability studies to obtain licensure of these products 
this process generally requires two to three years 
manufacturing and supply arrangements we currently operate a production facility in israel designed to meet current good manufacturing practices cgmp for production of our bulk human growth hormone  biolon  bio hep b  arthrease and insulin products  as well as the genetically engineered portion of the fibrimage product 
we also operate a modern filling suite for our biolon and arthrease syringes  which has undergone inspection and was approved by european and us regulatory authorities 
based on these inspections  european device approval ce mark and  in the case of biolon  fda approval were granted 
in april  btg purchased an existing building located approximately miles south of its current facility in israel 
construction of a modern production facility in this building that is designed to meet fda cgmp requirements for drugs  biologics and devices was completed at the end of  and qualification activities have been commenced and are expected to be completed in the second half of the new facility is designed to allow us to meet current regulatory requirements and our currently foreseeable manufacturing capacity needs 
in general  we cannot manufacture our products for commercial sale in this facility until the facility has been approved for manufacture of the specific product by the applicable regulatory agency  which we anticipate will occur during the period from the end of through the end of  depending on product and territory 
as a result of the violence in israel in recent years  the fda has from time to time suspended inspections of manufacturing facilities in israel  any future suspension of inspection activities could have an adverse effect on our ability to begin manufacturing our products at this new facility 
in addition  the fda cancelled its scheduled april visit to israel in light of the current situation with iraq 
before moving production of a product to the new facility  we will compile inventory for the period we anticipate will be required to move the equipment  qualify it in the new facility and obtain the required regulatory inspections 
if this period takes longer than anticipated  or sales are higher than anticipated  we may not be able to meet demand for the product on a timely basis  which could adversely affect our business 
although a substantial portion of the hgh supplied by btg to its distributors is in bulk form  btg also provides distributors with fully packaged product 
for these distributors  btg s bulk human growth hormone is formulated  filled and packed in vials in germany by dr 
madaus gmbh  our subcontractor for manufacturing the packaged product 
in addition  sterilization of the biolon syringe is performed by mediplast israel ltd  our subcontractor for these purposes 
we believe that we operate our facilities under  and are in compliance in all material respects with  current fda good laboratory and manufacturing practices 
our oxandrin product is currently being manufactured for us by searle  which originally developed the product 
our agreement with searle provides that searle will produce and exclusively sell oxandrin to btg 
in march btg and searle extended the agreement to april if our agreement with searle is not renewed thereafter and our alternative oxandrolone suppliers have not received the required regulatory approvals  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
see risk factors we are dependent on oxandrin sales for a significant portion of our revenue  and any decrease in oxandrin sales could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to conduct our business and we are dependent on third party suppliers  and any failure by them to fulfill their obligations to us could adversely affect our ability to meet demand for our product 
the agreement provides that searle will not produce oxandrin for any other entity prior to april because our prior alternate supplier of oxandrolone was unable to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals  in february we entered into a supply agreement with gideon richter ltd 
grl pursuant to which grl will supply oxandrolone to btg on an exclusive basis provided certain annual minimum purchase requirements are met 
should searle for any reason be unable to supply oxandrin to btg prior to grl obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals  btg s business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
grl has advised us that it intends to file for regulatory approval in the second quarter of and believes that it will obtain the necessary approvals by the end of see risk factors we are dependent on third party suppliers  and any failure by them to fulfill their obligations to us could adversely affect our ability to meet demand for our product and item legal proceedings 
bms contract manufactured delatestryl for btg until it closed its manufacturing facility in july we currently expect that our inventory of delatestryl sourced from bms will run out during  with the exact timing depending on demand and our allocation of available inventory 
although sabex inc of canada sabex agreed in march to contract manufacture delatestryl for us  we cannot sell delatestryl manufactured by sabex until fda approval is obtained and  as a result  we expect our remaining delatestryl inventory to be exhausted before our new manufacturer will be in a position to supply delatestryl to us 
once our delatestryl inventory runs out  we will be unable to meet customer demand and our current delatestryl customers may have to use a competing product 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain fda approval of delatestryl manufactured by sabex on a timely basis or at all and  even if we are able to do so  that our customers will return to using our product 
see risk factors we are dependent on third party suppliers  and any failure by them to fulfill their obligations to us could adversely affect our ability to meet demand for our products 
rosemont manufactures all of its products at a uk medicines control agency mca registered manufacturing facility that is designed for the production of aqueous oral liquids in a range of presentations from simple syrups to suspensions 
rosemont holds a manufacturer s specials license  allowing for the manufacture of unlicensed oral liquid drugs  and a wholesale dealer s license  allowing for the distribution of those drugs 
rosemont last passed an mca inspection of its facility in april rosemont dedicates almost all of its manufacturing capacity to the production of its own products  and conducts limited contract manufacturing for third parties 
during the fourth quarter of  rosemont obtained a home office license from the uk regulatory authorities in order to allow its facility to handle and process uk schedule  part substances  which covers anabolics such as oxandrolone 
in february  btg israel was awarded iso certification by the standards institution of israel sii 
the certification was issued with respect to the manufacture  packaging and dispatch of btg s pharmaceutical products for human use 
iso is one of a series of quality management system standards established by the international organization for standardization iso based in geneva  switzerland 
it is equivalent to the european community standard en sii is a member of an international organization  the international quality certification network iqnet that encompasses quality certification institutes worldwide in a mutual recognition agreement 
receipt of the iso certification was a significant milestone in the process of obtaining the biolon ce mark 
in august  sii awarded btg israel iso certification for its environmental management system 
the iso series of standards  dealing with the environment and its protection  are important from both a regulatory and commercial point of view 
governmental regulation regulation by governmental authorities in the united states and other countries is a significant factor affecting the timing of the commercialization of our products and our ongoing research and development activities 
all of our products require regulatory approval by governmental agencies prior to commercialization 
various laws and regulations govern or influence the research and development  manufacturing  safety  labeling  storage  record keeping and marketing of our products 
the lengthy process of seeking these approvals  and the subsequent compliance with applicable laws and regulations  require the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us to obtain or maintain  or any delay in obtaining or maintaining  regulatory approvals could materially adversely affect our business 
btg s policy is to conduct its research and development activities in compliance with current united states national institutes of health guidelines for research involving recombinant dna molecules  and with comparable guidelines in israel and other countries where we may be conducting clinical trials or other developmental activities 
see risk factors we are subject to stringent governmental regulation  and our failure to comply with applicable regulations could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business 
clinical testing  manufacturing and marketing of human pharmaceutical products require prior approval from the fda and comparable agencies in foreign countries 
the fda has established mandatory procedures and safety and efficacy standards that apply to the testing  manufacture and marketing of such products in the united states 
in the united states  these procedures include pre clinical studies  the filing of an investigational new drug application ind or equivalent  human clinical trials and approval of an nda 
the results of pre clinical testing  which include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product and its formulations  must be submitted to the fda as part of an ind that must be reviewed before clinical testing can begin 
clinical trials generally involve a three phase process phase i trials are conducted in volunteers or patients to determine the early side effect profile and  perhaps  the pattern of drug distribution and metabolism  phase ii trials are conducted in groups of patients with a specific disease in order to determine appropriate dosages  expand evidence of the safety profile and  perhaps  determine preliminary efficacy  and phase iii large scale  comparative trials are conducted on patients with a target disease in order to generate enough data to provide the statistical proof of efficacy and safety required by national regulatory agencies 
the results of the preclinical and clinical testing are then submitted to the fda in the form of a new drug application nda for approval to commence commercial sales 
the fda may  in responding to an nda  grant marketing approval  request additional information or deny the approval if it determines that the nda does not provide an adequate basis for approval 
among the conditions for an nda approval is the requirement that the prospective manufacturer s qualify control and manufacturing procedures conform on an ongoing basis with current good manufacturing practices gmp 
in complying with gmp  we must continue to expend time  money and effort in the areas of production and quality control to ensure full compliance 
following approval of the nda  we are subject to periodic inspections by the fda 
any determination by the fda of manufacturing deficiencies could materially adversely affect our business 
european countries generally follow the same procedures 
the european union has established a unified filing system administered by the committee for proprietary medicinal products cpmp designed to reduce the administrative burden of processing applications for new pharmaceutical products 
following cpmp review and approval  marketing applications are submitted to member countries for final approval and pricing approval  as appropriate 
in addition to obtaining regulatory approval of products  it is generally necessary to obtain regulatory approval of the facility in which the product will be manufactured 
the receipt of regulatory approvals often takes a number of years  involves the expenditure of substantial resources and depends on a number of factors  including the severity of the disease in question  the availability of alternative treatments and the risks and benefits demonstrated in clinical trials 
on occasion  regulatory authorities may require larger or additional studies  leading to unanticipated delay or expense 
there can be no assurance that any approval will be granted and  even if granted  such approval may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained 
in addition  the regulatory approval processes for products in the us  european countries and other countries around the world are undergoing or may undergo changes  and we cannot predict what effect any changes in the regulatory approval process may have on our business 
under uk regulations  rosemont is permitted to sell two categories of products 
for those products for which rosemont completes bioequivalence and stability studies  it receives a product license from the uk medicines control agency and is permitted to promote such products to physicians  nurses and pharmacists 
for compounds that are not licensed in an oral liquid formulation  rosemont holds a license to accept custom orders for such products  known as specials  but is not permitted to promote specials 
in addition to the foregoing  btg s present and future business may be subject to various laws and regulations relating to safe working conditions  clinical  laboratory and manufacturing practices  the experimental use of animals and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances  including radioactive compounds and infectious disease agents  used in connection with our research  as well as national restrictions on technology transfer  and import  export and customs regulations and similar laws and regulations in foreign countries 
patents and proprietary rights our scientific staff and consultants are actively working in various areas of pharmaceutical development to develop techniques  microorganisms  processes and products to achieve btg s commercial aims 
btg protects its intellectual property rights in this work by a variety of means  including filing patent and trademark applications in the united states  europe and other major industrialized countries 
btg also relies upon design registrations  trade secrets and improvements  unpatented proprietary know how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain its competitive position 
see risk factors we depend upon proprietary technology  which may be difficult to protect 
as of february   btg was maintaining worldwide approximately issued patents either owned or exclusively licensed by btg  including patents issued in the united states  patents issued by the european patent office epo  which in turn resulted in the issuance of national patents in europe  and patents issued in israel 
additionally  approximately patent applications owned or exclusively licensed by btg are pending in various countries 
there can be no assurance that any of the patent applications assigned or licensed to btg will result in issued patents  or that issued patents will not be circumvented or invalidated 
we believe that important legal issues remain to be resolved as to the extent and scope of patent protection  and we expect that in certain cases litigation may be necessary to determine the validity and scope of our and others proprietary rights 
such litigation may consume substantial amounts of our resources 
see risk factors if our intellectual property positions are challenged  invalidated or circumvented  or if we fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation  our business could be adversely affected and item legal proceedings 
we are aware of patent applications filed by  or patents issued to  other entities with respect to technology potentially useful to btg and  in some cases  related to products and processes being developed by btg 
we cannot presently assess the effect  if any  that these patents may have on our operations 
the extent to which efforts by other researchers have or will result in patents and the extent to which the issuance of patents to others would have a materially adverse effect on our business or would force us to obtain licenses from others is currently unknown 
see risk factors if our intellectual property positions are challenged  invalidated or circumvented  or if we fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation  our business could be adversely affected 
rosemont s formulation know how is not patented  although rosemont has obtained a patent on one resulting oral liquid products 
to date  btg has been  or currently is  party to several legal and administrative proceedings relating to its technologies  products and patents and the patents of others 
see item legal proceedings 
operations in israel btg has significant research and development and biologics production activities in israel that are affected by economic  military and political conditions there and in the middle east in general 
since the establishment of the state of israel in  a number of armed conflicts have taken place between israel and its arab neighbors and a state of hostility  which varies in degree and intensity  has caused security and economic problems in israel 
any major hostilities involving israel could adversely affect our research  development and biologics production operations  which would harm our business 
we cannot assure you that ongoing or revived hostilities related to israel will not have a material adverse affect on us or our business and on our share price 
despite the progress towards peace between israel and its arab neighbors  the future of these peace efforts is uncertain 
in addition  since october  there has been a significant increase in violence  primarily in the west bank and gaza strip 
during the course of military operations  israel s military reserves  which include a number of our employees and executives  may be called up 
to date  we have been able to continue our research and development and biologics production activities during periods of military mobilization  although there can be no assurance that such activities could be continued in the event of future hostilities 
see risk factors our business may be adversely affected by developments in israel 
as a result of the violence in israel in recent years  the fda has from time to time suspended inspections of manufacturing facilities in israel 
in addition  the fda cancelled its scheduled april visit to israel in light of the current situation with iraq 
to date european regulatory agencies have not suspended inspections of manufacturing facilities in israel 
products we intend to manufacture at our newly constructed manufacturing currently biolon  arthrease  bio tropin and bio hep b facility cannot be shipped into the united states until the fda has inspected and approved this facility 
we do not currently intend to transfer our manufacturing activities to our newly constructed manufacturing facility until the fda has inspected and approved the new facility 
a suspension of inspection activities by the fda will delay the commencement of manufacturing at our new facility  which could adversely affect our business 
the suspension of fda inspections delayed inspection of the contract sterilizer utilized by btg for its biolon product  which required us to stop shipping biolon to the us from the fourth quarter of until september  when the facility was approved following an inspection by the fda 
btg has not secured alternate arrangements to prevent potential interruption of manufacturing activities  and we cannot assure that we will be able to secure alternative manufacturing arrangements on a timely basis on reasonable terms  or at all  if needed 
because btg israel is involved in a technological industry and is an exporter of israeli goods  btg has enjoyed the benefits of certain programs promulgated by the government of israel in order to encourage the development of technology and export of israeli products 
however  there can be no guarantee that these programs will continue 
competition therapeutic drug development is conducted by numerous companies throughout the world 
competition is intense in the product areas in which btg has focused its efforts 
significant competition comes from independent  dedicated biotechnology companies as well as from large  established pharmaceutical and specialty pharmaceutical companies 
the primary competitive factors in this field are the ability to attract and retain highly qualified scientists and technicians  to create and maintain scientifically advanced technology during a period of rapid technological development and to develop proprietary products or processes 
the principal parameters influencing competition are the efficacy of products and their production processes  the patent protection available for such products  the timing of commercialization vis a vis competitors products and price 
btg s competitive position in the industry varies on a product by product and country by country basis depending upon the efficacy of btg s products as compared to competing products  the scope of patent protection in each country for btg s products as compared to competing products  whether btg s product is the first such product to be commercialized and  where there are a number of similar products  the price of btg s product as compared to its competitors products  and the relative strength of btg s partner in the territory 
many of our current competitors have significantly greater financial and organizational resources than us 
since technological developments are expected to continue at a rapid pace in the biotechnology industry  the successful development of btg s products will be dependent upon its ability to maintain a competitive position with respect to its technology 
see risk factors we operate in a highly competitive market and our competitors may develop alternative technologies and products before or more successfully than we do 
we are currently seeking to expand our operations and product pipeline through the acquisition of businesses  products and or technologies 
we face significant competition for acquisitions  which could adversely affect our ability to expand our operations and product pipeline 
see risk factors we are seeking to expand through acquisition  which entails risks 
employees as of february   we had approximately employees  most of whom are engaged in manufacturing  quality assurance  marketing and sales  and research and development activities 
in addition  we have consulting arrangements with scientists at various institutions and universities in the united states  europe and israel 
btg s ability to develop marketable products and to establish and maintain its competitive position in light of technological developments will depend  in part  on its ability to attract and retain qualified scientific  marketing and management personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense 
none of btg s employees is represented by a labor union and btg has experienced no work stoppages 
we believe our relations with our employees are good and we have experienced a low turnover rate among our employees

we are dependent on oxandrin sales for a significant portion of our revenue  and any decrease in oxandrin sales could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to conduct our business 
sales of oxandrin in  and amounted to approximately million  million and million  respectively  representing  and  respectively  of btg s total product sales in those periods 
we believe that sales of oxandrin will continue to constitute a significant portion of our total revenues for the next several years 
accordingly  any factor adversely affecting sales of oxandrin could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and profitability and our ability to conduct our business 
oxandrin is facing increasing competition from other products  including human growth hormone  and there can be no assurance that sales of oxandrin will continue to increase 
a substantial number of users of oxandrin are patients with aids and as more successful treatments for this disease  such as protease inhibitors  are developed  the need to use oxandrin by these patients may be reduced 
although btg is working to expand the use of oxandrin to treat other conditions covered by the product s current fda approval  such as the treatment of involuntary weight loss associated with burns  non healing wounds  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cancer  there can be no assurance that btg will be successful in its efforts 
oxandrin is no longer patented as an active pharmaceutical ingredient  although btg does hold certain patents on specific uses  and there can be no assurance that others will not introduce an oxandrolone product 
we have received notice that solchem  formerly an affiliate of societa prodotti antibiotici spa spa  filed its drug master file relating to a generic oxandrolone product with the fda in spa was our initial alternate source supplier of oxandrolone through at least we believe that solchem intends to supply oxandrolone to mutual pharmaceutical  a generic drug manufacturer 
a settlement of litigation with solchem precludes solchem from supplying oxandrolone to mutual for commercial purposes until october we expect a generic version of oxandrin could be introduced as early as since btg s launch of oxandrin in december through december  a significant portion of oxandrin sales has been for treatment of patients suffering from aids related weight loss 
however  the rate of growth in the aids related weight loss market has slowed substantially  and there can be no assurance that it will continue to grow in the future 
our inability to continue to increase our sales in the aids related weight loss market or to expand into other markets could have a material adverse effect on our business 
oxandrin sales experienced rapid growth in december and the first half of in large part as a result of the commencement by ross of marketing oxandrin for the treatment of involuntary weight loss in the long term care market  which represented approximately of oxandrin wholesaler to end user sales in both and although oxandrin prescriptions increased in compared to and in compared to  to date the average prescription written for the long term care market involves a lower dose of oxandrin than the average prescription written for the aids market and  therefore  the rate of growth in oxandrin sales will be less than the rate of growth in prescriptions 
ross has the right to terminate our oxandrin co marketing agreement at any time upon six months notice 
if ross elects to do so  our oxandrin sales could be adversely affected until we are able to replace the ross sales force  which we may not be able to do successfully 
there can be no assurance that demand for oxandrin will continue to increase 
quarterly fluctuations in sales of oxandrin can have a significant impact on our quarterly results of operations 
quarterly sales of oxandrin in  and are set forth in the following table first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter total in thousands prior to september  our sales of oxandrin consisted solely of sales to accredo  which served as our wholesale and retail distributor of oxandrin in the united states  and  beginning in the third quarter of  ross  which is co marketing oxandrin in the long term care market in the united states 
the increase in oxandrin sales in each of the last three quarters of was due to accredo s completion  in may  of the oxandrin inventory reduction that accredo began in april as a result of a slowing in the rate of increase in oxandrin prescriptions 
the increase in oxandrin sales during the first half of was due to i the commencement  in september  of sales by ross for the long term care market for the treatment of patients with involuntary weight loss  including stocking activity by wholesalers in connection with the launch of this product in the long term care market  ii stocking by certain wholesalers in anticipation of a price increase  iii increased purchases by accredo following its completion  in may  of a reduction in the amount of oxandrin inventory it carried  which reduction began in april  and iv increased wholesaler sales of oxandrin by accredo 
upon completion of its inventory reduction in may  accredo began to purchase  on a monthly basis  an amount of oxandrin equal to the average end user ie  wholesaler sales during the preceding three months 
however  because of the significant increase in oxandrin purchases by wholesalers in the first quarter of in anticipation of a price increase and in connection with the launch of oxandrin into the long term care market  accredo s purchases of oxandrin in the second quarter were higher than the levels of its sales of oxandrin to wholesalers in that period 
as a result  accredo s inventory of oxandrin increased beyond the desired level 
accordingly  btg and accredo amended their distribution arrangement effective august to provide for reduced purchases of oxandrin until accredo s inventory was reduced to desired levels and thereafter to ensure that sales of oxandrin by btg to accredo more accurately reflected end user demand 
as a result  sales of oxandrin in the second half of were million lower than in the first half of and million lower than in the second half of in the fourth quarter of btg renegotiated its agreement with accredo  and btg now sells oxandrin directly to wholesalers and accredo distributes oxandrin and delatestryl for btg on a fee for service basis 
accredo will earn management fees from btg for certain services it will continue to provide  such as warehousing and shipping of product 
the transition to the new arrangement  which we anticipate will be completed by the end of march  when accredo ceases to act as distributor of the mg oxandrin tablets  resulted in sales of oxandrin decreasing by million in the fourth quarter of compared to the third quarter of  as accredo began to reduce its inventory of the mg oxandrin tablet 
btg s sales of oxandrin in the first quarter of will be adversely affected by accredo s working down of its inventory of the mg tablets 
reductions in wholesaler purchases of oxandrin from accredo in the second  third and fourth quarters of and significantly reduced purchases of oxandrin by accredo in the second half of adversely affected the growth in btg s product sales and revenues and btg s results of operations in the second half of because purchases by wholesalers fluctuate from month to month and quarter to quarter based on their own operating strategies including desired levels of inventories  purchases by their customers and stocking in advance of anticipated price increases  btg s sales will fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
we are dependent on third party suppliers  and any failure by them to fulfill their obligations to us could adversely affect our ability to meet demand for our products 
btg is dependent on third parties for the manufacture of oxandrin and delatestryl  the filling and vialing of its bio tropin product and the sterilization of its biolon product 
our dependence upon third parties for the manufacture of these products may adversely impact our profit margins or result in unforeseen delays or other problems beyond our control 
if for any reason we are unable to retain these third party manufacturers  or obtain alternate third party manufacturers  on commercially acceptable terms  we may not be able to distribute our products as planned 
if we encounter delays or difficulties with contract manufacturers in producing  filling  vialing or sterilizing these products  the sale of these products would be adversely affected 
although btg is a party to an exclusive supply arrangement with searle  covering the supply of oxandrin to btg through april  and a supply agreement with grl  there can be no assurance that searle will continue  or that grl will be able  to provide btg with sufficient supplies of oxandrin to satisfy its future needs on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
bms ceased manufacturing delatestryl for btg in july when it closed the manufacturing facility where it produced delatestryl 
we currently expect that our inventory of delatestryl sourced from bms will run out during  with the exact timing depending on demand and our allocation of available inventory 
although sabex agreed in march to contract manufacture delatestryl for us  we cannot sell delatestryl manufactured by sabex until fda approval is obtained and  as a result  we expect our remaining delatestryl inventory to be exhausted before our new manufacturer will be in a position to supply delatestryl to us 
once our delatestryl inventory runs out  we will be unable to meet customer demand and our current delatestryl customers may have to use a competing product 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain fda approval of delatestryl manufactured by sabex on a timely basis or at all and  even if we are able to do so  that our customers will return to using our product 
in addition  btg is dependent on dr 
madaus gmbh dr 
madaus to fill and vial our bio tropin product 
we were forced to stop shipping biolon to the us from the fourth quarter of until september because the fda was unable to inspect the new manufacturing facility of our contract sterilizer for biolon due to the violence in israel in recent years 
third party suppliers may encounter difficulties in achieving quality control and quality assurance  and also may experience shortages in qualified personnel  and therefore may not be able to meet our production schedules 
switching suppliers may be difficult because the number of potential manufacturers is limited 
a shutdown in any of the manufacturing facilities utilized by btg s suppliers due to technical  regulatory or other problems  resulting in an interruption in supply of products  could significantly delay the manufacture of one or more of our products  which could have an adverse impact on our financial results  and we may have to seek alternative sources of supply or abandon or sell product lines on unsatisfactory terms 
we might not be able to enter into alternative supply arrangements at commercially acceptable rates  if at all 
the manufacturing process for pharmaceutical products is highly regulated  and regulators may shut down manufacturing facilities that they believe do not comply with regulations 
the fda current good manufacturing practices are extensive regulations governing the manufacturing process  stability testing  record keeping and quality standards 
we do not have control over  other than by contract  third party manufacturers compliance with these regulations and standards 
because the suppliers of key components and materials must be named in an nda filed with the fda for a product  significant delays can occur if the qualification of a new supplier is required 
in the event of any interruption in supply from searle  grl  sabex once an approved supplier or dr 
madaus due to regulatory reasons  processing problems  capacity constraints or other causes  alternative manufacturing arrangements may not be available on a timely basis  if at all 
any failure of searle  grl  sabex or dr 
madaus to fulfill its obligations to btg could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
see manufacturing and supply arrangements 
we are dependent on third party licensees to commercialize many of our products  and their failure to perform adequately could adversely affect our results of operations 
except for the sale of oxandrin and delatestryl in the united states  its oral liquid pharmaceutical products in the united kingdom and its products in israel  which btg markets on its own  btg is dependent on third party licensees to distribute its products 
these arrangements typically provide our licensees with certain rights to manufacture and market specified products developed using our proprietary technology  subject to an obligation to pay royalties to us based on any future product sales or to purchase product from us  and require the licensee to conduct required clinical trials and obtain any necessary regulatory approvals 
the success of these arrangements depends on each licensee s own financial  competitive  marketing and strategic considerations  which include the relative advantages  including patent and proprietary positions  of alternate products being marketed or developed by others 
furthermore  the amounts of any payments to be received by btg under its license agreements from sales of product by licensees will be dependent on the extent to which its licensees devote resources to the development and commercialization of the products 
although we believe our licensees have an economic motivation to commercialize their products  we have no effective control over the licensees commercialization efforts 
btg may from time to time seek to collaborate with larger pharmaceutical companies on the research  development and commercialization of certain products 
in trying to attract corporate partners to collaborate in the research  development and commercialization process  btg faces serious competition from other biopharmaceutical companies and the in house research and development staffs of the larger pharmaceutical companies 
if btg is unable to enter into arrangements with corporate partners  its ability to proceed with the research  development and commercialization of its products may be severely limited 
furthermore  larger pharmaceutical companies often explore multiple technologies and products for the same medical conditions 
therefore  they are likely to enter into collaborations with btg s competitors for products addressing the same medical conditions addressed by btg s products 
depending on how other product candidates advance  a corporate partner may slow down or abandon its work on btg s product candidates or terminate its collaborative arrangement with btg in order to focus on these other prospects 
if our intellectual property positions are challenged  invalidated or circumvented  or if we fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation  our business could be adversely affected 
btg s success will depend  in part  on its ability to obtain patent protection for its technology including use of its products  preserve trade secrets and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties 
the patent positions of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies are highly uncertain and involve complex scientific  legal and factual questions 
patent disputes are frequent and costly  can delay or preclude the commercialization of products and could subject btg to significant liabilities to third parties 
many biopharmaceutical companies have employed intellectual property litigation as a way to gain a competitive advantage 
btg has developed patentable technology and proprietary know how and has acquired from various universities and institutions certain basic technologies  as to which either patents have been issued or patent applications are pending 
there can be no assurance that patent applications will result in issued patents  that the claims allowed in such issued patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our proprietary rights or that patents will not be challenged  circumvented or invalidated or that rights granted pursuant to such patents will provide competitive advantages to btg 
in addition  our patents may not protect us against competitors with similar products or technologies because competing products or technologies may not infringe our patents 
because patent applications are maintained in secrecy for a period of time after filing  we cannot be certain that others have not filed patent applications for technology covered by our pending applications or that we were the first to file patent applications for such technology 
btg also relies on trade secrets  proprietary know how and technological innovation that it seeks to protect with confidentiality agreements with its employees  consultants and licensees 
there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached  that btg will have adequate remedies for any breach or that btg s trade secrets and proprietary know how will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors 
btg s commercial success will also depend in part on our not infringing patents or proprietary rights of third parties 
a number of companies and research and academic institutions have developed technologies  filed patent applications or received patents on various technologies that relate to our business  and such entities may file applications for or be issued patents in the future with respect to technology potentially necessary or useful to btg 
some of these technologies  applications or patents may conflict with btg s technologies and existing or future patents  if any  or patent applications 
such conflict could limit the scope of patents that btg has obtained or may obtain in the future or result in patent applications failing to issue as patents 
in addition  if third parties obtain patents which cover our activities  there can be no assurance that btg would be able to license such patents on reasonable terms  or at all  or be able to license or develop alternative technology on a timely basis  or at all 
as more patents are issued to third parties  the risk that btg s products and activities may give rise to claims that they infringe the patents of others increases 
in addition  the presence of patents or other proprietary rights belonging to other parties may lead to the termination of research and development of a particular product 
btg has in the past been  is currently and may in the future be involved in litigation and administrative hearings to determine the validity and scope of its and others patents and proprietary rights 
such litigation and administrative proceedings have to date required  and may in the future require  a significant commitment of our resources 
any such commitment may divert resources from other areas of btg s business 
see item legal proceedings 
the successful development of pharmaceutical products is costly and highly uncertain 
a substantial portion of our annual operating budget is spent on research  development and clinical activities 
we are currently developing several products that may never reach clinical trials  achieve success in the clinic  be submitted for approval  be approved for manufacturing or marketing or achieve commercial success 
further  we rely on third parties to assist in various stages of the development process 
these third parties may be unable to complete their work in a timely fashion or in a manner that is satisfactory to us 
should they be unable to meet our needs  our product development process would be delayed and we may have to incur substantial additional costs 
successful pharmaceutical product development is highly uncertain and is dependent on numerous factors  many of which are beyond btg s control  and very few research and development projects produce a commercial product 
products that appear promising in the early phases of development may fail to reach the market for numerous reasons  including  but not limited to they may be found to be ineffective or to have harmful side effects in pre clinical or clinical testing  they may fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals  they may turn out to be uneconomical because of manufacturing costs or other factors  or they may be precluded from commercialization by the proprietary rights of others or by competing products for the same indication 
success in pre clinical and early clinical trials does not ensure that large scale trials will be successful 
data obtained from pre clinical and clinical trials are frequently susceptible to varying interpretations that may delay  limit or prevent regulatory approvals 
many biopharmaceutical companies  including btg  have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials  even after experiencing promising results in pre clinical and early human testing 
btg is currently seeking to expand its product pipeline through the acquisition of businesses  products and or technologies 
to the extent btg acquires products that are still in pre clinical or clinical trials and  therefore  face the risks discussed above 
to the extent btg uses its cash resources  incurs debt and or issues shares of its common stock in these acquisitions but the acquired product cannot be commercialized  btg s business and prospects could be adversely affected 
the length of time necessary to complete clinical trials and to submit an application for marketing approval for a final decision by a regulatory authority varies significantly and is dependent upon a number of factors  many of which are outside our control  including the rate of patient enrollment 
patient enrollment is a function of several factors  including the size of the patient population and the proximity of patients to clinical sites 
delays in patient enrollment could result in increased costs and delays in completion of the clinical trials 
in addition  pre clinical and clinical trials must meet regulatory and institutional requirements 
the principal factors affecting btg s research and development expenses include the number of and outcome of clinical trials currently being conducted by it and or its collaborators  the number of products in development and later stage research and future levels of revenue 
should our revenues decline  we may limit our spending on research and development 
we have limited manufacturing capacity 
we currently operate a production facility meeting current good manufacturing practices in israel for production of our bulk human growth hormone  biolon  bio hep b  arthrease and insulin products  as well as the genetically engineered portion of the fibrimage product 
we also operate a modern filling suite for our biolon and arthrease syringes 
we completed construction of a new biologics production facility at the end of  and qualification activities have been commenced and are expected to be completed in the second half of rosemont manufactures all of its products at a uk medicines control agency mca registered manufacturing facility that is designed for the production of aqueous oral liquids in a range of presentations from simple syrups to suspensions 
the manufacture of btg s products involves a number of technical steps and requires meeting stringent quality control specifications imposed by governmental regulatory bodies and by btg itself 
further  such products can only be manufactured in facilities approved by the applicable regulatory authorities 
as a result  btg may not be able to quickly and efficiently replace its manufacturing capacity in the event that it is unable to manufacture its products at its facilities 
in the event of a natural disaster  equipment failure  strike  war or other difficulty  btg may be unable to manufacture its products in a manner necessary to fulfill demand 
btg s inability to fulfill demand may permit its licensees and distributors to terminate their agreements  seek alternate suppliers or manufacture the products themselves 
additionally  if btg does not receive regulatory approval for its new facility  it would likely be unable to meet the anticipated increased demand for its products  which would have a material adverse effect on btg s business  results of operations and financial condition 
any substantial delay in obtaining regulatory approval for its manufacturing processes and facilities could also have a material adverse effect on btg 
as a result of the violence in israel in recent years  the fda has from time to time suspended inspections of manufacturing facilities in israel  which could delay fda inspection of btg s new manufacturing facility and  therefore  use of such facility to manufacture products 
in addition  the fda cancelled its scheduled april visit to israel in light of the current situation with iraq 
btg is dependent on third parties to manufacture all or a portion of certain of its products 
see we are dependent on third party suppliers  and any failure by them to fulfill their obligations to us could adversely affect our ability to supply our products 
during we expect to begin to transfer our israeli manufacturing operations to our new manufacturing facility in israel 
the manufacture of each product at the new manufacturing facility must be approved by applicable regulatory authorities  including the fda for products shipped to the us  prior to the resumption of manufacturing of that product at the new facility 
prior to transferring the manufacturing for the product to the new facility  btg will build inventory of each product that it believes will be adequate to meet demand over the period required to transfer the manufacturing operations and have them inspected and approved 
to the extent it takes longer than expected to complete the transfer or obtain regulatory approval or demand for our product exceeds our expectations  our ability to meet our customers requirements for their products will be adversely affected  which could adversely affect our business 
we have limited marketing capability and experience 
btg established a sales and marketing force in the united states during the second half of to promote distribution of oxandrin and other btg products in the united states  and its rosemont subsidiary has a sales force that markets rosemont s products in the united kingdom 
with respect to territories outside the united states  the united kingdom for rosemont products  and israel  btg does not yet have an established sales force and relies on third parties to market its products 
there can be no assurance that our marketing strategy will be successful 
turnover in our sales and marketing employees adversely affects our product sales  as it can take several months to find and train new sales and marketing employees 
competition for experienced sales and marketing employees is intense  and we compete with companies with greater resources and larger product lines 
btg s ability to market its products successfully in the future will be dependent on a number of factors  many of which are not within its control 
see we are dependent on third party licensees to commercialize many of our products  and their failure to perform adequately could adversely affect our results of operations 
we are seeking to expand through acquisitions  which entails risk 
btg is currently seeking to expand its operations and product pipeline through the acquisition of businesses  products and or technologies 
expansion through acquisition involves several risks 
in order to consummate an acquisition  btg may issue additional equity  which would dilute current stockholders percentage ownership and could dilute earnings per share  incur substantial debt and or assume contingent liabilities 
btg may not be able to successfully integrate any acquired business  product and or technology without a significant expenditure of operating  financial and management resources  if at all 
in addition  acquired businesses may not at the time of acquisition be profitable  and acquired products may require substantial additional research and development and clinical trials before they can be commercialized  all of which could adversely affect btg s results of operations and financial position 
potential products acquired at an early stage of development may fail to reach the market for numerous reasons  including those set forth above under the successful development of pharmaceutical products is costly and highly uncertain 
to the extent we acquire technology that is not fully commercially developed and has no alternative future use at the time of acquisition  we will be required to write off immediately the fair market value of such technology  which will adversely affect our results of operations 
our ability to expand through acquisitions is currently limited by our low stock price and the fact that we used a substantial portion of our cash to acquire rosemont 
other companies  many of which have substantially greater financial resources than we do  compete with us for the acquisition of businesses  products and technologies 
we may not be able to acquire additional businesses or rights to products or technologies on acceptable terms  or at all  or be able to obtain financing for such acquisitions on acceptable terms  if at all 
our inability to acquire additional businesses  products and or technologies could limit the overall growth of our business 
furthermore  even if we obtain rights to a product or technology or acquire a business  we may not be able to generate sales sufficient to create a return on our investment 
we expect our quarterly results to fluctuate  which may cause volatility in our stock price 
btg s revenues and expenses have in the past and may in the immediate future continue to display significant variations  which variations have in the past caused and would in the future cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year 
these variations are due to a variety of factors  including the amount and timing of product sales  which can be affected by demand for our products  our inability to provide adequate supply for our products and changes in wholesaler buying patterns  changes in the government s or private payors reimbursement policies for our products  increased competition from new or existing products  the timing of the introduction of new products  the timing and realization of milestone and other payments from licensees  the timing and amount of expenses relating to research and development  product development and manufacturing activities  the extent and timing of costs of obtaining  enforcing and defending intellectual property rights  and any charges related to acquisitions 
because many of btg s expenses are fixed  particularly in the short term  any decrease in revenues will adversely affect btg s earnings until revenues can be increased or expenses reduced 
for example  in  the first five months of and the second half of  btg s revenues and earnings were adversely affected by accredo s decision to reduce the amount of oxandrin inventory it carried 
see we are dependent on oxandrin sales for a significant portion of our revenue  and any decrease in oxandrin sales could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to conduct our business 
because of fluctuations in revenues and expenses  it is possible btg s operating results for a particular quarter or quarters will not meet the expectations of public market analysts and investors  causing the market price of btg common stock to decline 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance and stockholders should not rely on those comparisons to predict our future operating or share price performance 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we may be unable to obtain any additional capital needed to operate and grow our business 
the development and commercialization of products requires substantial funds 
in addition  we may require cash to acquire businesses  products and or technologies 
our cash requirements are satisfied primarily through product sales 
historically  we have also obtained capital through i funding of projects through collaborative research and development arrangements  ii contract fees  iii government of israel funding of a portion of certain research and development projects  mainly through the office of its chief scientist  and iv equity and debt financings 
there can be no assurance that these financing alternatives will be available in the future to satisfy our cash requirements 
we are currently in discussions with the chief scientist about whether it will continue to fund some of our research and development activities  and we cannot assure you that the chief scientist will continue to provide funding to us 
we believe that our current cash resources  together with anticipated product sales  will be sufficient to fund our ongoing operations for the foreseeable future 
there can  however  be no assurance that product sales will occur as anticipated  that current agreements with third party distributors of our products will not be canceled  that the chief scientist will continue to provide funding  or that unanticipated events requiring the expenditure of funds will not occur 
in september  we used a substantial portion of our cash resources to acquire rosemont 
the satisfaction of our future cash requirements will depend in large part on the status of commercialization of our products  our ability to enter into additional research and development and licensing arrangements  and our ability to obtain additional equity investments or bank loans if necessary 
there can be no assurance that btg will be able to obtain additional funds or  if such funds are available  that such funding will be on favorable terms 
if additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities of btg  dilution to existing stockholders may result 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities or borrowings  btg may incur substantial interest expense and could become subject to financial and other covenants that could restrict our ability to operate our business 
if adequate funds are not available  btg may be required to significantly curtail one or more of its commercialization efforts or research and development programs or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others on less favorable terms than might otherwise be available 
we are subject to stringent governmental regulation  and our failure to comply with applicable regulations could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business 
virtually all aspects of our business are subject to extensive regulation by numerous federal and state governmental authorities in the us  such as the fda  as well as by foreign countries where we manufacture or distribute our products 
of particular significance are the requirements covering research and development  testing  manufacturing  quality control  labeling and promotion of pharmaceutical products for human use 
all of btg s products  manufacturing processes and facilities require governmental licensing or approval prior to commercial use 
a pharmaceutical product cannot be marketed in the united states until it has been approved by the fda  and then can only be marketed for the indications and claims approved by the fda 
as a result of these requirements  the length of time  the level of expenditures and the laboratory and clinical information required for approval of an nda are substantial 
the approval process applicable to products of the type being developed by btg usually takes five to seven years from the commencement of human clinical trials and typically requires substantial expenditures 
btg and its licensees may encounter significant delays or excessive costs in their respective efforts to secure necessary approvals or licenses 
before obtaining regulatory approval for the commercial sale of its products  btg is required to conduct pre clinical and clinical trials to demonstrate that the product is safe and efficacious for the treatment of the target disease 
the timing of completion of clinical trials is dependent upon a number of factors  many of which are outside our control 
in addition  btg and its partners may encounter delays or rejections based upon changes in the policies of regulatory authorities 
the fda and foreign regulatory authorities have substantial discretion to terminate clinical trials  require additional testing  delay or withhold registration and marketing approval  and mandate product withdrawals 
failure to obtain requisite governmental approvals  or failure to obtain approvals of the scope requested  could delay or preclude btg or its licensees from marketing their products  could limit the commercial use of the products and could also allow competitors time to introduce competing products ahead of product introduction by btg and thereby have a material adverse effect on btg s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
even after regulatory approval is obtained  use of the products could reveal side effects that  if serious  could result in suspension of existing approvals and delays in obtaining approvals in other jurisdictions 
regulation by governmental authorities in the united states and other countries is a significant factor affecting the timing of the commercialization of btg s products and its ongoing research and development activities 
the timing of regulatory approvals is not within our control 
to date  the length of time required to obtain regulatory approval of genetically engineered products has been significantly longer than expected  both for btg and the biotechnology industry in general 
these delays have had and  if they continue  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we believe that these delays have in the past negatively impacted our ability to attract funding and that  as a result  the terms of such financings have been less favorable to us than they might otherwise have been had btg s product revenues provided sufficient funds to finance the large costs of taking a product from discovery through commercialization 
as a result  btg has had to license the commercialization of many of its products to third parties in exchange for research funding and royalties on product sales  resulting in lower revenues than if btg had commercialized the products on its own 
failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can  among other things  result in significant fines or other sanctions  termination of clinical trials  suspension of regulatory approvals  product recalls  seizure of products  imposition of operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions 
while we have developed and instituted a corporate compliance program based on current best practices  we cannot assure you that we or our employees have been or will be in compliance with all potentially applicable federal and state regulations 
further  fda policy or similar policies of regulatory agencies in other countries may change and additional governmental requirements may be established that could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our products 
we cannot predict what effect changes in regulations  enforcement positions  statutes or legal interpretation  when and if promulgated  adopted or enacted  may have on our business in the future 
changes could  among other things  require changes to manufacturing methods or facilities  expanded or different labeling  new approvals  the recall  replacement or discontinuance of certain products  additional record keeping and expanded scientific substantiation 
these changes  or new legislation  could adversely affect our business 
our sales depend on payment and reimbursement from third party payors  and a reduction in the payment or reimbursement rate could result in decreased use or sales of our products 
btg s ability to successfully commercialize human therapeutic products depends in part on the extent to which reimbursement for the cost of such products and related treatment will be available from government health administration authorities  private health coverage insurers and other organizations 
significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products  and there can be no assurance that adequate third party coverage will be available for btg to maintain price levels sufficient for the realization of an appropriate return on its investment in product development 
government and other third party payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for new therapeutic products approved for marketing by the fda and by refusing  in some cases  to provide any coverage for use of approved products for disease indications for which the fda has not granted marketing approval 
if adequate coverage and reimbursement levels are not provided by government and third party payors for use of our healthcare products  the market acceptance of these products would be adversely affected 
in addition  in recent years a number of federal and state healthcare reform proposals have been introduced to contain healthcare costs 
there can be no assurance as to the ultimate content  timing or effect of any healthcare reform legislation  nor is it possible at this time to estimate the impact of potential legislation on our business 
regulatory approval of prices is also required in most countries outside the united states 
in particular  certain european countries will condition their approval of a product on the agreement of the seller not to sell the product for more than a certain price in that country 
there can be no assurance that the establishment of a price in one european country will not have the practical effect of requiring our marketing partners to sell the product in other european countries at no higher than such price 
because btg generally supplies product to its marketing partners for a specified percentage of net sales  there can be no assurance that the resulting prices would be sufficient to generate an acceptable return on our investment in our products or even cover our manufacturing costs for such product 
in addition  in the uk pharmaceutical companies generally must renegotiate pricing with the government annually when sales to the national health service exceed a specified level 
we operate in a highly competitive market and our competitors may develop alternative technologies and products before or more successfully than we do 
the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive  and the technological areas in which we work continue to evolve at a rapid pace 
our future success depends upon maintaining our ability to compete in the research  development and commercialization of products and technologies in our areas of focus 
competition from pharmaceutical  chemical and biotechnology companies  universities and research institutions is intense and expected to increase 
many of these competitors have substantially greater research and development capabilities and experience and manufacturing  marketing  financial and managerial resources than we do 
acquisitions of competing companies by large pharmaceutical companies or other companies could enhance the financial  marketing and other resources available to these competitors 
our competitors may develop products that are superior to those we are developing 
rapid technological development may result in our products or processes becoming obsolete before marketing of these products or before we recover a significant portion of the research  development and commercialization expenses incurred with respect to those products 
our products must compete with others to gain market acceptance and market share 
an important factor will be the timing of market introduction of competitive products 
accordingly  the relative speed with which we and competing companies can develop products  complete the clinical testing and approval processes  and supply commercial quantities of the products to the market will be an important element of market success 
significant competitive factors include capabilities of our collaborators  product efficacy and safety  timing and scope of regulatory approval  product availability  marketing and sales capabilities  reimbursement coverage from insurance companies and others  the amount of clinical benefit of our product candidates relative to their cost  the method of administering a product  price  and patent protection 
our competitors may develop more effective or more affordable products or achieve earlier product development completion  patent protection  regulatory approval or product commercialization than we do 
our competitors achievement of any of these goals could have a material adverse effect on our business 
these companies also compete with btg to attract qualified personnel and to attract third parties for acquisitions  joint ventures or other collaborations 
we may be unable to obtain and retain skilled personnel 
we are dependent upon the efforts of our officers  scientists and other employees 
the loss of certain of these key employees could materially and adversely affect our business 
our business is dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified research and managerial personnel 
there is a great deal of competition for the limited number of scientists with expertise in the area of btg s operations 
we do not maintain  and have no current intention of obtaining  key man life insurance on any of our employees 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in hiring or retaining the personnel we require for continued growth 
our failure to hire and retain such personnel could materially adversely affect our business 
our business may be adversely affected by developments in israel 
btg conducts significant research  development and biologics production activities in israel and these activities can be affected by economic  military and political conditions in that country and in the middle east in general 
since the establishment of the state of israel in  a number of armed conflicts have taken place between israel and its arab neighbors and a state of hostility  which varies in degree and intensity  has caused security and economic problems in israel 
any major hostilities involving israel could adversely affect our research  development and production operations  which would harm our business 
we cannot assure you that ongoing or revived hostilities related to israel will not have a material adverse affect on us or our business and on our share price 
despite the progress towards peace between israel and its arab neighbors  the future of these peace efforts is uncertain 
in addition  since october  there has been a significant increase in violence  primarily in the west bank and gaza strip 
during the course of military operations  israel s military reserves  which include a number of our employees and executives  may be called up  which could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business 
as a result of the violence in israel in recent years  the fda has from time to time suspended inspections of manufacturing facilities in israel 
in addition  the fda cancelled its scheduled april visit to israel in light of the current situation with iraq 
products we intend to manufacture at our newly constructed manufacturing facility cannot be shipped into the united states until the fda has inspected and approved this facility 
we do not currently intend to transfer our manufacturing activities to our newly constructed manufacturing facility until the fda has inspected and approved the new facility 
suspension of these activities by the fda will delay the commencement of manufacturing at our new facility  which could adversely affect our business 
the suspension of fda inspections delayed inspection of the contract sterilizer utilized by btg for its biolon product  which required us to stop shipping biolon to the united states from fourth quarter of until september  when the facility was approved following an inspection by the fda 
we may face significant risks in expanding our international operations 
we significantly expanded our international operations with the acquisition of rosemont on september  on a pro forma basis giving effect to the acquisition of rosemont as if it occurred as of january   our product sales outside the united states would have accounted for approximately and of our total product sales for the years ended december  and  respectively 
international operations involve a number of additional risks  including the following difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  less familiarity with business customs and practices  the imposition of tariffs and import and export controls  the impact of possible recessionary environments in economies outside the us  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  currency exchange rate fluctuations  the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
to the extent that our international operations expand  we expect that an increasing portion of our international product sales and other revenues will be denominated in foreign currencies 
we do not currently engage in currency hedging transactions 
however  as we continue to expand our international operations  exposures to gains and losses on international currency transactions may increase 
we may choose to limit our exposure by the purchase of forward foreign exchange contracts or similar hedging strategies 
the currency exchange strategy that we adopt may not be successful in avoiding exchange related losses 
in addition  the above listed factors may cause a decline in our future international revenue and  consequently  may harm our business 
we may not be able to sustain or increase revenue that we derive from international sources 
we may incur substantial product liability 
the testing and marketing of btg s products entail an inherent risk of product liability and associated adverse publicity 
pharmaceutical product liability exposure could be extremely large and pose a material risk 
although btg has so far been able to obtain indemnification from pharmaceutical companies commercializing its products  there can be no assurance that other such companies will agree in the future to indemnify btg for other of btg s products or that such companies will  if obligated to do so  have adequate resources to fulfill their indemnity agreements 
further  to the extent btg elects to test or market products independently  it will bear the risk of product liability directly 
btg presently has  of product liability insurance coverage in place 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain existing insurance or obtain additional insurance on acceptable terms  or at all 
it is possible that a single product liability claim could exceed our insurance coverage limits  and multiple claims are possible 
any successful product liability claim made against btg could substantially reduce or eliminate any stockholders equity btg may have and could have a significant adverse impact on btg s business 
product liability claims  regardless of their merits  could be costly and divert management s attention  and adversely affect our reputation and the demand for our products 
our stock price is volatile  which could adversely affect your investment 
the market prices for securities of biopharmaceutical companies  including btg  have been volatile  and it is likely that the price of our common stock will fluctuate in the future 
factors such as announcements of technological innovations or new commercial products by btg or its competitors  announcements by btg or its competitors of results in pre clinical testing and clinical trials  governmental regulation  patent or proprietary rights developments  public concern as to the safety or other implications of biotechnology products  changes in earnings estimates and recommendations by securities analysts  period to period fluctuations in financial results and market conditions in general may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock 
the volatility of our common stock imposes a greater risk of capital losses on our stockholders than would a less volatile stock 
in addition  such volatility makes it difficult to ascribe a stable valuation to a stockholder s holdings of our common stock 
the stock market has also experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are often unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of the securities of biopharmaceutical companies  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies 
such litigation would result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources  which could adversely affect our business 
see the ultimate outcome of pending securities litigation is uncertain 
in addition  the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected by future exercises of outstanding options and the issuance of common stock in acquisitions of businesses  products and or technologies 
at december  options to purchase an aggregate of approximately  shares of common stock were outstanding 
a portion of these options have exercise prices below the current market price of the common stock 
all of the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of these outstanding options have been registered under the securities act of  as amended  and  accordingly  when issued will be freely tradable without restriction 
the sale of a significant amount of these shares at one time could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in addition  btg may issue additional stock  warrants and or options to raise capital or complete acquisitions in the future 
btg may also issue additional securities in connection with its employee benefit plans 
during the terms of such options and warrants  the holders thereof are given the opportunity to profit from a rise in the market price of the common stock 
the exercise of such options and warrants may have an adverse effect on the market value of the common stock 
the existence of such options and warrants may adversely affect the terms on which btg can obtain additional equity financing 
to the extent the exercise prices of such options and warrants are less than the net tangible book value of the common stock at the time such options and warrants are exercised  btg s stockholders will experience an immediate dilution in the net tangible book value of their investment 
further  the future sale of a substantial number of shares of common stock by existing stockholders and option holders may have an adverse impact on the market price of the common stock 
see item market for registrant s common equity and related stockholder matters 
effecting a change of control of btg could be difficult  which may discourage offers for shares of our common stock 
our certificate of incorporation and the delaware general corporation law contain provisions that may delay or prevent an attempt by a third party to acquire control of us 
these provisions include the requirements of section of the delaware general corporation law 
in general  section prohibits designated types of business combinations  including mergers  for a period of three years between us and any third party that owns or more of our common stock 
this provision does not apply if our board of directors approves of the transaction before the third party acquires of our stock  the third party acquires at least of our stock at the time its ownership goes past the level  or our board of directors and two thirds of the shares of our common stock not held by the third party vote in favor of the transaction 
we have also adopted a stockholder rights plan intended to deter hostile or coercive attempts to acquire us 
under the plan  if any person or group acquires more than of our common stock without approval of our board of directors under specified circumstances  our other stockholders have the right to purchase shares of our common stock  or shares of the acquiring company  at a substantial discount to the public market price 
the plan thus makes an acquisition much more costly to a potential acquirer 
our certificate of incorporation also authorizes us to issue up to  shares of preferred stock in one or more different series with terms fixed by the board of directors 
stockholder approval is not necessary to issue preferred stock in this manner 
issuance of these shares of preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult for a person or group to acquire control of us 
no shares of our preferred stock are currently outstanding 
while our board of directors has no current intentions or plans to issue any preferred stock  issuance of these shares could also be used as an anti takeover device 
the ultimate outcome of pending securities litigation is uncertain 
after the restatement of our financial statements for the years ended december   and and the first two quarters of  we and some of our current and former officers were named in a series of similar purported securities class action lawsuits 
the complaints in theses actions allege violations of us securities law through alleged material misrepresentations and omissions and seek an unspecified award of damages 
in addition  our directors and arthur andersen llp  our prior auditor  were named in a derivative action that claims  among other things  that our directors breached their fiduciary duties by failing to implement and maintain an adequate internal accounting control system 
we intend to contest these actions vigorously 
there can be no guarantee as to the ultimate outcome of this pending litigation or whether the ultimate outcome may have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of our operations 
btg has referred these claims to its directors and officers insurance carrier  which has reserved its rights as to coverage with respect to these actions

in january  btg commenced an action against genentech in the united states district court for the southern district of new york the us district court seeking  among other things  declaratory judgments as to the non infringement  invalidity and unenforceability of certain genentech patents 
the delaware action was consolidated with the new york action  and in august the us district court granted a preliminary injunction prohibiting the commercial introduction in the united states of btg s hgh pending the outcome of the patent infringement action 
the us court of appeals for the federal circuit cafc rejected btg s appeal of the grant of the preliminary injunction  and the united states supreme court denied btg s petition for a writ of certiorari 
two of the genentech patents originally at issue have expired  and only a third patent of genentech  expiring in july  remains in issue 
the action in the us district court was tried in january and the us district court found that the remaining genentech patent was invalid and vacated the preliminary injunction 
following genentech s appeal  which was heard in december  the cafc reversed the district court s decision in september  reinstated the preliminary injunction and remanded the issue of infringement to the district court for further proceedings 
btg petitioned the cafc for a rehearing en banc  which was denied in december btg and genentech have settled this dispute  and a modified injunction has been issued which precludes btg from importing or selling in the united states its hgh product produced according to its original expression system during the remaining life of this genentech patent  however  this should not preclude btg from marketing hgh manufactured using a new expression system for which btg obtained fda approval in september  subject to the outcome of the patent dispute with novo nordisk discussed below 
we cannot assure you that genentech will not claim that our new expression system violates its patent that expires in and seek an injunction to prevent our using the new expression system to produce hgh for teva 
see item business products and applications commercialized products bio tropin human growth hormone 
three patent applications of genentech in israel  which cover general methods relating to genetically engineered products and to human growth hormone  have been allowed two in and one in btg opposed the grant of all these patents 
two of these patent applications expired during without ever being granted 
the third  which expired in june  corresponds to the us patent that was invalidated by the us district court in january procedurally  hearings before the israel registrar of patents took place during regarding the third patent application and summations and replies were subsequently filed 
btg filed a motion in december requesting that the registrar strike out genentech s patent application due to its expiration and rule that the matter should no longer be heard 
the registrar denied the motion and btg has applied for leave to appeal  which was granted in march the registrar left office in october without rendering a decision and to date a new registrar has not been appointed 
the filing of a leave to appeal does not bar the new registrar from rendering a decision on the merits of the patent application 
there can be no assurance that btg will be successful in its opposition to the grant of this now expired patent application 
if btg is unsuccessful in its opposition in israel the patent may be deemed effective and genentech may sue for infringement 
in september  jcr received a letter from attorneys representing genentech and its licensee  kabi pharmacia  claiming that jcr s sale of btg s hgh infringed certain genentech patents and patent applications and demanding that jcr cease the sale of btg s hgh in japan 
jcr and btg have filed oppositions to five genentech patent applications in japan  oppositions with respect to four of these patent applications were denied but the fifth was successful  which resulted in that patent application being revoked during we do not believe that we are infringing or have ever infringed any valid genentech patent or patent application  but there can be no assurance that our hgh will not be found to infringe certain genentech patents in japan  the latest of which expired in july  or any patents issued pursuant to pending patent applications  the latest of which expired in april if btg s hgh is found to infringe certain genentech patents in japan  jcr and or btg may be obligated to pay damages with respect to sales made while the patents were in effect

in novo was issued a us patent for a biosynthetic ripe human growth hormone free of contaminants from pituitary derived human growth hormone 
at btg s request  the united states patent office board of patent appeals and interferences the patent office in declared an interference to determine whether btg  rather than novo  should hold the patent to biosynthetic ripe human growth hormone on the basis that btg scientists  not novo scientists  were the first to invent 
the patent office has ruled in favor of novo  and btg commenced an action in federal court seeking a determination that btg scientists were the first to invent 
should btg not be awarded priority  btg could be precluded from marketing in the united states hgh produced using this new expression system 
in april novo commenced an action in federal court against btg and teva pharmaceuticals usa  inc  btg s exclusive distributor of human growth hormone in the us  claiming that btg s manufacture of human growth hormone using its new expression system and the sale or offer for sale of tev tropin human growth hormone by teva in the us infringes novo s patent 
novo sought an injunction that  if issued  would preclude teva from marketing tev tropin in the us and unspecified monetary damages 
on june   the united states district court for the district of delaware granted novo s motion for a preliminary injunction prohibiting the sale of tev tropin recombinant human growth hormone in the us in november  the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit determined that novo did not meet the requirement for a preliminary injunction of establishing a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits  and vacated the injunction 
this action is currently scheduled for trial beginning july in september  we received a letter from biogen stating that it believed that our recombinant surface antigen of the hepatitis b virus  which is an active ingredient of our bio hep b vaccine  or the intermediates for the process of making such antigen  falls within the claims of one or more of biogen s patents and or patent applications 
we made inquiries of biogen and smithkline beecham the exclusive licensee of all of biogen s hepatitis b patents except those in japan requesting that btg be granted a license to the biogen patents  however  such efforts were not successful 
we obtained a compulsory license under biogen s israeli patent to manufacture our bio hep b vaccine in israel  however  this license expired  and the related litigation was terminated  following the expiration of biogen s israeli patent 
we are now able to manufacture and sell bio hep b in israel 
see item business products and applications commercialized products bio hep b hepatitis b vaccine 
we have been advised by scigen  our bio hep b licensee in certain countries in the far east  that in april biogen initiated suit against scigen in singapore asserting that scigen s conduct of clinical trials in singapore with respect to our hepatitis b vaccine constitutes infringement of biogen s patent rights in singapore and claiming rights in the data obtained by scigen through its clinical trials in singapore and that an interlocutory hearing was held in september scigen notified btg that the application for the injunction was dismissed by the high court in september  but biogen has not withdrawn its case against scigen in singapore 
biogen s singapore patent rights are based on the registration of its corresponding uk patents  and the validity of patents in singapore depends on the validity of the corresponding uk patents 
biogen s broad uk patent was invalidated by the uk court of appeals in october the house of lords upheld this decision in october  although biogen had claims of a more limited scope allowed to the same patent 
additionally  three claims of a narrower uk patent were upheld 
we believe that none of these claims will affect commercialization of our vaccine  although there can be no assurance of this 
we are aware of certain other patents that have been granted or are pending and which  if granted  may prevent us from selling our vaccine in the united states  europe and certain other countries 
btg s failure to obtain any needed license  or a determination that its vaccine infringes the patent rights of biogen or others  would substantially limit  if not prohibit  the commercialization of the bio hep b vaccine in those countries in which biogen or others have a patent until such patent is revoked or expires 
our ability to secure any necessary licenses or sublicenses to these patents or applications cannot be predicted 
we are aware of patent applications filed by  or patents issued to  other entities with respect to technology potentially useful to us and  in some cases  related to products and processes being developed by us 
we cannot presently assess the effect  if any  that these patents may have on our operations 
the extent to which efforts by other researchers have resulted or will result in patents and the extent to which the issuance of patents to others would have a materially adverse effect on btg or would force btg to obtain licenses from others is currently unknown

non patent related litigation in  solchem  a former affiliate and manufacturing arm of spa  filed a declaratory judgment action against btg in the united states district court of new jersey seeking a determination that it is not a party to btg s agreement with spa  which binds affiliates of spa  and therefore not bound by the non compete and free to sell oxandrolone to mutual pharmaceutical  a generic drug manufacturer 
btg counterclaimed against solchem and mutual  although the claims against mutual were dismissed 
the litigation with solchem and mutual was settled in early  with solchem essentially agreeing to comply with the non compete in spa s agreement with btg  which expires october  under the terms of the settlement  the amount of oxandrolone that solchem could supply to mutual prior to the expiration of the non compete was limited  and btg denied a request by solchem to increase this amount

the agreement proved to be commercially infeasible and btg terminated the agreement in june serono labs contested btg s termination of that agreement in and asserted that a non compete provision  which btg maintained expired in mid and in any case did not apply to teva  the us licensee for btg s recombinant human growth hormone  if it is applicable at all  should continue until april  in march  btg filed a lawsuit in new jersey to confirm btg s position on these issues 
serono labs commenced an action against btg in massachusetts to enforce the agreement 
the new jersey court denied serono labs motion to dismiss the new jersey action and enjoined serono labs from pursuing its action in massachusetts 
the new jersey court also denied btg s motion for summary judgment 
while the co promotion agreement with serono labs precluded recovery for consequential damages  serono labs asserted a claim for unspecified monetary damages based on a massachusetts law regarding unfair trade practices 
under this law  the court was entitled  in its discretion  to enhance the damage award by up to three times but not less than twice the actual damages if there was a willful or knowing violation with the malicious intent to injure the other party 
the court could also award attorneys fees and costs 
in connection with the settlement of this dispute  btg made a payment to serono labs 
in btg accrued approximately  of commissions received by it from gentiva in respect of saizen  which btg subsequently returned because gentiva  which was unable to sell most of the product before it expired  returned the product to serono labs 
in  duramed pharmaceuticals  inc filed an abbreviated new drug application with the fda seeking approval of a generic version of mircette

btg appealed and a decision is pending 
if the patent is held not to be infringed  organon may assert that it is no longer required to pay btg royalties on the sale of mircette 
barr introduced its generic product in  which has adversely affected sales of mircette and  therefore  royalties to btg

the exchange rate at the acquisition closing date was per in accordance with sfas accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which prohibits hedge accounting for a hedge of an anticipated business combination  we recorded a gain of approximately  on the forward contract 
acquisition of myelos corporation on march   btg acquired myelos corporation  a privately held biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel therapeutics to treat diseases of the nervous system 
under the terms of the acquisition agreement  btg paid myelos shareholders million in a combination of cash and stock million in cash and million through the issuance of approximately  shares of btg common stock based on a per share value of  representing the average closing price of btg s common stock for the trading day period ending one day prior to the february  date the acquisition agreement was executed 
in the event that i btg publicly announces that it will file a new drug application nda related to the use of prosaptide to treat neuropathic pain or neuropathy  ii btg receives united states food and drug administration fda minutes stating that the clinical data possessed by btg is sufficient for an nda filing for the use of prosaptide to treat neuropathic pain or neuropathy without requiring any further testing or iii btg initiates preparation of an nda for prosaptide for the treatment of neuropathic pain or neuropathy the date the earliest of the foregoing occurs being the payment trigger date  then btg will pay to the myelos shareholders an additional million  at least approximately million of which must be paid in shares of btg common stock  valued at the average of the closing prices of btg common stock during the trading days ending on the payment trigger date  and the remainder can be paid in cash  shares of btg common stock  or a combination thereof  as determined by btg in its sole discretion 
in addition  in the event that the fda approves the sale of prosaptide for the treatment of neuropathic pain or neuropathy  btg will pay the myelos shareholders of the net sales of prosaptide for the treatment of neuropathic pain or neuropathy during the month period beginning on the earlier of i the th full month after commercial introduction of prosaptide in the united states for the treatment of neuropathic pain or neuropathy and ii april  at least of this payment must be paid in shares of btg common stock  valued at the average of the closing prices of btg common stock during the days ending one day prior to the payment  and the remainder can be paid in cash  shares of btg common stock  or a combination thereof  as determined by btg in its sole discretion 
in no event will btg be obligated to issue in aggregate to the myelos shareholders more than  shares of btg common stock 
any amount of the contingent payments that cannot be paid in shares of btg common stock shall instead be paid in shares of btg s preferred stock 
the preferred stock will be non voting  non convertible  non transferable  non dividend paying except to the extent a cash dividend is paid on the btg common stock  with no mandatory redemption for a period of years and one day from the march  closing date of the acquisition  and a right to share in proceeds in liquidation  up to the liquidation amount 
the transaction was treated as a purchase for accounting purposes 
the purchase price for accounting purposes was approximately  including acquisition costs of  based on a value per share for the approximately  shares of btg common stock issued in the acquisition of  representing the average closing price of btg s common stock for the four day period preceding february   the date the terms of the acquisition were agreed 
in connection with the merger and based on an independent valuation  btg allocated  to in process research and development projects of myelos  representing the estimated fair value based on risk adjusted cash flows of the acquired technology 
at the date of the merger the technology acquired in the acquisition was not fully commercially developed and had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  the value was expensed as of the acquisition date 
btg recorded negative goodwill of  on its balance sheet  primarily because the amount written off as in process research and development acquired exceeded the purchase price for accounting purposes 
during this negative goodwill was being amortized over its expected useful life of five years 
in accordance with sfas no 
 amortization of the negative goodwill ceased beginning january   and the balance remaining will be maintained as a deferred credit until it is either netted against the contingent payments or reflected in net income as an extraordinary item should the contingent payments not become due because the technology did not meet the milestones that trigger payment 
btg allocated values to the in process research and development based on an independent valuation of the research and development project 
the value assigned to these assets was determined by estimating the costs to develop the acquired technology into a commercially viable product  estimating the resulting net cash flows from the product  and discounting the net cash flows to their present value 
the revenue projection used to value the in process research and development was based on estimates of relevant market size and growth factors  expected trends in technology  and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by btg and its competitors 
the resulting net cash flows from such product are based on management s estimates of cost of sales  operating expenses and income taxes from such product 
btg believes that the assumptions used in the forecasts were reasonable at the time of the merger 
no assurance can be given  however  that the underlying assumptions used to estimate sales  development costs or profitability  or the events associated with such product  will transpire as estimated 
for these reasons  actual results may vary from projected results 
the most significant and uncertain assumptions relating to the in process research and development relate to the ability to successfully develop a product and the projected timing of completion of  and revenues attributable to  that product 
investment in omrix biopharmaceuticals  inc in january  in order to obtain a period of exclusivity to negotiate a possible strategic relationship with omrix biopharmaceuticals  inc omrix  btg loaned  to omrix and agreed to convert the loan into  and to purchase an additional  of  shares of omrix preferred stock if it did not pursue a relationship 
btg determined not to pursue a strategic relationship with omrix  and on march  converted the existing loan into  and purchased an additional  of  shares of omrix preferred stock  which is convertible into approximately of omrix common stock on a fully diluted basis 
omrix is a privately held company that develops and markets a unique surgical sealant and a number of immunology products based on blood plasma processing technology 
omrix currently sells its products in europe  south america and the middle east 
during the fourth quarter of  btg determined that the decline in the value of its investment in omrix was other than temporary and  accordingly  wrote down the value of this investment by  based on management s evaluation of current market conditions and omrix s operations and forecasts 
the write down is included as a component of other income expense  net 
based on the current information available regarding omrix  management believes the current carrying value of its investment in omrix is appropriate 
outlook early in  we announced our intention to invest more heavily in research and development and marketing and sales activities and provided guidance that  as a consequence  earnings would not match those of  although growth in earnings would resume in btg anticipates growth in revenues and earnings per share in in particular  with the transition of oxandrin to a direct to wholesaler business model vs 
selling to accredo  availability  as of october  of the oxandrin mg tablet strength in addition to the mg tablet  as well as the broader focus of the btg sales force in new areas of potential demand for an effective involuntary weight loss product  and a strong upward trend suggested by recent prescription data  oxandrin sales are expected to grow 
human growth hormone sales are expected to be less than those of due to ongoing pricing pressures in japan and delatestryl sales are expected to be less than those of due to anticipated supply constraints following heavier than expected demand in sales of oral liquid pharmaceutical products by rosemont are anticipated to continue to grow at their historical rates and are expected to make a significant contribution to btg s revenues 
contract fees and royalty revenues are expected to approximate their levels 
increases in expenses in compared to are expected due to btg s heavy commitment to its pipeline products and associated research and development costs 
we anticipate that research and development expense will be approximately of our total revenues 
incremental investment in marketing and sales to maximize the commercial potential of btg s marketed products in the us and the us is also anticipated 
cost of goods as a percentage of sales is anticipated to grow as a function of product mix  the rosemont contribution to total product sales  and the validation of btg s new production facility in israel 
additionally  amortization of intangibles expense is expected to increase to approximately million on an annual rate  reflecting the full year impact of the rosemont acquisition 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
the items in our consolidated financial statements requiring significant estimates and judgments are as follows revenue recognition 
product sales are recognized when the product is shipped and collectability is probable  net of discounts  sales incentives  sales allowances and freight out 
contract fees  which consist mainly of license of marketing and distribution rights and research and development projects  are being recognized over the estimated term of the related agreements 
revenues related to performance milestones are recognized based upon the achievement of the milestone  as defined in the respective agreements  and when collectability is probable 
advance payments received in excess of amounts earned are included in deferred revenue 
royalties are recognized once agreement exists  the sale is made and the royalty is earned 
other revenues represent funds received by btg for research and development projects that are partially funded by the chief scientist of the state of israel 
btg recognizes revenue upon performance of such funded research 
intangible assets acquired 
on september   we acquired rosemont 
the aggregate purchase price of  is being allocated based on the estimates of the fair value of the intangible assets acquired  which was based on a preliminary independent appraisal and information currently available 
intangible assets consist of developed products  trademarks and several patents and are being amortized  using the straight line method  over the estimated useful life of approximately years 
btg s management determined the estimation of the useful life of the intangible assets based on independent appraisal and information currently available 
btg is in the process of completing the evaluation of certain acquired assets  as well as certain intangibles and the useful life 
accordingly  the allocation of the purchase price and the useful life are subject to revisions 
investments 
from time to time we invest in nonmarketable equity securities for strategic purposes 
these investments are carried at cost 
we periodically monitor the liquidity progress and financing activities of these entities to determine if impairment write downs are required 
in  we wrote down our investment in omrix by in process research and development acquired 
in connection with our acquisition of myelos corporation in  we allocated  to in process research and development projects of myelos  representing the estimated fair value based on risk adjusted cash flows of the acquired technology 
we expensed this value as of the acquisition date because the technology was not fully commercially developed and had no alternative future uses 
income taxes 
deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and their basis for income tax purposes and the tax effects of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for valuation allowances  and at december   did not record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset 
if we determine in the future that we will not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets  adjustments will be charged to income in the period that we made such determination 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
litigation 
we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings referred to in note commitments and contingent liabilities of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
we do not believe these legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
however  were an unfavorable ruling to occur in any quarterly period  there exists the possibility of a material impact on the operating results 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which begin on page of this annual report on form k  which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the fiscal periods indicated the dollar amount and the percentage of our revenues represented by the items reflected on our consolidated statements of operations dollars in thousands 
year ended december  revenues product sales contract fees royalties other revenues total revenues expenses research and development marketing and sales general and administrative cost of product sales amortization of intangibles and negative goodwill associated with acquisitions commissions and royalties write off of in process research and development acquired total expenses operating income loss other income expense  net income loss before income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle income tax expense income loss before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle cumulative effect of change in accounting principle net income loss btg has historically derived its revenues from product sales as well as from collaborative arrangements with third parties  under which btg may earn up front contract fees  may receive funding for additional research including funding from the chief scientist of the state of israel chief scientist  is reimbursed for producing certain experimental materials  may be entitled to certain milestone payments  may sell product at specified prices and may receive royalties on sales of product 
we anticipate that product sales will constitute the majority of our revenues in the future 
revenues have in the past displayed and will in the immediate future continue to display significant variations due to changes in demand for our products  new product introductions by btg and its competitors  the obtaining of new research and development contracts and licensing arrangements  the completion or termination of such contracts and arrangements  the timing and amounts of milestone payments  and the timing of regulatory approvals of products 
the following table summarizes  for the fiscal periods indicated  btg s sales of its commercialized products and their percentage of total product sales dollars in thousands year ended december  oxandrin bio tropin biolon delatestryl oral liquid pharmaceutical products other total we believe that our product mix will vary from period to period based on the purchasing patterns of our customers and our focus on i increasing market penetration of our existing products  ii expanding into new markets  and iii commercializing additional products 
we believe that sales of oxandrin will continue to constitute a significant portion of our total revenues for the next several years 
accordingly  any factor adversely affecting sales of oxandrin could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and profitability and our ability to conduct our business 
quarterly fluctuations in sales of oxandrin have had a significant impact on our quarterly results of operations 
quarterly sales of oxandrin in  and are set forth in the following table first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter total in thousands until the fourth quarter of  our sales of oxandrin consisted of sales to accredo health services  inc  formerly known as gentiva health services  inc accredo  our wholesale and retail distributor of oxandrin in the united states  and  beginning in the third quarter of  the ross products division of abbott laboratories ross  which is co marketing oxandrin in the long term care market 
in the fourth quarter of btg renegotiated its agreement with accredo  and btg now sells oxandrin directly to wholesalers and accredo distributes oxandrin for btg on a fee for service basis 
accredo will earn management fees from btg for certain services it will continue to provide  such as warehousing and shipping of product 
the transition to the new arrangement  which we anticipate will be completed by the end of march when accredo ceases to act as distributor of the mg oxandrin tablets  resulted in sales of oxandrin decreasing by  in the fourth quarter of compared to the third quarter of  as accredo began to reduce its inventory of the mg oxandrin tablet 
btg s sales of oxandrin in the first quarter of will be adversely affected by accredo s working down of its inventory of the mg tablets 
the increase in oxandrin sales in each of the last three quarters of was due to accredo s completion  in may  of the oxandrin inventory reduction that accredo began in april as a result of a slowing in the rate of increase in oxandrin prescriptions 
the increase in oxandrin sales during the first half of was due to i the commencement  in september  of sales by ross for the long term care market for the treatment of patients with involuntary weight loss  including stocking activity by wholesalers in connection with the launch of this product in the long term care market  ii stocking by certain wholesalers in anticipation of a price increase  iii increased purchases by accredo following its completion  in may  of a reduction in the amount of oxandrin inventory it carried  which reduction began in april  and iv increased wholesaler sales of oxandrin by accredo 
upon completion of its inventory reduction in may  accredo began to purchase  on a monthly basis  an amount of oxandrin equal to the average end user ie  wholesaler sales during the preceding three months 
however  because of the significant increase in oxandrin purchases by wholesalers in the first quarter of in anticipation of a price increase and in connection with the launch of oxandrin into the long term care market  accredo s purchases of oxandrin in the second quarter were higher than the levels of its sales of oxandrin to wholesalers in that period 
as a result  accredo s inventory of oxandrin increased beyond the desired level 
accordingly  btg and accredo amended their distribution arrangement effective august to provide for reduced purchases of oxandrin until accredo s inventory was reduced to desired levels and thereafter to ensure that sales of oxandrin by btg to accredo more accurately reflected end user demand 
as a result  sales of oxandrin in the second half of were  lower than in the first half of and  lower than in the second half of since btg s launch of oxandrin in december through december  a significant portion of oxandrin sales has been for treatment of patients suffering from aids related weight loss 
however  the rate of growth in the aids related weight loss market has slowed substantially  and there can be no assurance that it will continue to grow in the future 
our inability to continue to increase our sales in the aids related weight loss market or to expand into other markets could have a material adverse effect on our business 
oxandrin sales experienced rapid growth in december and the first half of in large part as a result of the commencement by ross of the marketing of oxandrin for the treatment of involuntary weight loss in the long term care market  which represented approximately of oxandrin wholesaler to end user sales in both and although oxandrin prescriptions increased in compared to and in compared to  to date the average prescription written for the long term care market involves a lower dose of oxandrin than the average prescription written for the aids market and  therefore  the rate of growth in oxandrin sales will be less than the rate of growth in prescriptions 
ross has the right to terminate our oxandrin co marketing agreement at any time upon six months notice 
if ross elects to do so  our oxandrin sales could be adversely affected until we are able to replace the ross sales force  which we may not be able to do successfully 
btg has the right to terminate the agreement at the end of if ross does not meet specified sales levels 
there can be no assurance that demand for oxandrin will continue to increase 
reductions in wholesaler purchases of oxandrin from accredo in the second  third and fourth quarters of and significantly reduced purchases of oxandrin by accredo in the second half of adversely affected the growth in btg s product sales and revenues and btg s results of operations in the second half of because purchases by wholesalers fluctuate from month to month and quarter to quarter based on their own operating strategies including desired levels of inventories  purchases by their customers and stocking in advance of anticipated price increases  btg s sales will fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
the following table summarizes  for the fiscal periods indicated  btg s united states and international product sales and their percentage of total product sales dollars in thousands year ended december  united states international total domestic sales as a percentage of total product sales have fluctuated due primarily to a reduction in purchases of oxandrin by btg s us distributor from april through may and increased sales of oxandrin to btg s us distributor in the second half of and the first half of comparison of years ended december   and revenues 
revenues in increased to  from  in  which represented a increase from  in product sales  net of discounts  sales incentives  sales allowances and freight out  increased in to  from  in  which itself was a increase from product sales of  the changes in revenues between  and were primarily driven by changes in product sales  principally oxandrin 
product sales in include  of sales of oral liquid pharmaceutical products resulting from our acquisition of rosemont on september  sales of oxandrin in  and were   and  respectively  representing  and respectively  of btg s total product sales in those periods 
sales of oxandrin to accredo in  and were   and  net  respectively  representing  and  respectively  of btg s total sales of oxandrin 
sales of oxandrin in decreased by  or  from sales as a result of our transition to a direct to wholesaler business model rather than selling to accredo  which would then resell to distributors 
in sales of oxandrin increased  or  from sales 
sales of oxandrin increased  in the first half of due to i the commencement  in september  of sales by ross for the long term care market for the treatment of patients with involuntary weight loss  including stocking activity by wholesalers in connection with the launch of this product in the long term care market  ii stocking by certain wholesalers in anticipation of a price increase  iii increased purchases by accredo following its completion  in may  of a reduction in the amount of oxandrin inventory it carried  which reduction began in april  and iv increased wholesaler sales of oxandrin by accredo 
sales of oxandrin in the second half of decreased  from the comparable period in due to accredo s increased purchases of oxandrin in the second half of following completion of its inventory reduction and decreased purchases in the second half of to reduce inventory 
sales of human growth hormone in  and were   and  respectively  representing  and  respectively  of btg s total product sales in those periods 
sales of hgh in decreased by  or  from sales due to pricing pressures in japan  partially offset by an initial sale to teva 
sales of human growth hormone increased in by  or  over sales  primarily due to increased sales to jcr and ferring 
sales of hgh to jcr in  and were   and  respectively  representing  and  respectively  of btg s total product sales in those periods and  and  respectively  of btg s total hgh sales in those periods 
sales of hgh to ferring were   and  in  and  respectively  representing  and  respectively  of btg s total product sales in those periods and  and  respectively  of btg s total hgh sales in those periods 
sales of delatestryl in increased by  or  over sales  which sales increased by  or  over levels  when we had no sales of delatestryl in the second and third quarters 
the increase in delatestryl sales was due to the fda stopping the production of a competing generic injectable testosterone product used to treat men with hypogonadism testostrone deficiency in  which product has not to date been re introduced 
biolon sales in decreased  or  from levels  after sales increased  or  over sales 
in the first quarter of we halted product shipments of biolon to the us pending fda approval of a supplemental application relating to an upgrade in btg s manufacturing process to conform it to a higher standard of quality implemented by btg 
btg resumed shipments to the us in the first quarter of  although shipments again stopped in the fourth quarter of as the fda was not able to inspect the new manufacturing facility of btg s contract sterilizer for biolon due to the violence in israel in recent years until july and shipments resumed in september following fda approval 
contract fees for the year ended december  were  which includes  of contract fees received in prior periods but recognized in in accordance with sab for the year ended december  contract fees were  which represent contract fees received in prior periods but recognized in in accordance with sab for the year ended december   contract fees  which consist of licensing and option to license fees  amounting to  or  of total revenues  were earned from certain of btg s collaborative partners

other revenues consist primarily of funding from the chief scientist  which represented  and of other revenues in the years ended december   and  respectively 
research and development expense was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in research and development expenditures in compared to resulted primarily from the addition of research and development activities for prosaptide following the acquisition of myelos in march  increased patent related expenses  increased clinical activities and rosemont s development expenses following the acquisition 
the increase in research and development expenditures in compared to resulted mainly from the increase in research and development personnel and legal fees related to patent maintenance and patent interference proceedings  as well as the addition of research and development activities for prosaptide following the acquisition of myelos  partially offset by decreased expenses in compared to associated with developing alternate manufacturing sources for oxandrin and for a new tablet formulation and decreased compensation charges arising from modification of the periods of vesting and exercisability of certain stock option awards to certain employees and former employees made in connection with the termination of their employment and post employment consulting arrangements 
marketing and sales expense was   and  in the years ended december   and  respectively 
these expenses primarily related to the sales and marketing force in the united states that btg established principally in the second half of and during to promote distribution of oxandrin in the united states and  beginning with the fourth quarter of  rosemont s sales and marketing force in the united kingdom 
the significant increase in marketing and sales expense in was due to increased promotion and marketing costs  as well as increased compensation and training costs due to btg s expansion of its field force  as btg sought to maximize oxandrin s potential and growth  and the inclusion of  of rosemont s expenses  partially offset by decreased incentive compensation costs 
the decrease in marketing and sales expense in compared to derived mainly from decreased advertising  promotional and market research activities  partially offset by increased compensation costs 
general and administrative expense was   and  in the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in general and administrative expense in compared to was principally due to increased compensation costs  substantial audit fees incurred in in connection with the reaudit of btg s financial statements and inclusion of rosemont s expenses following the acquisition  partially offset by decreased merger and acquisition activities in and higher consulting fees in general and administrative expenses for includes a  non recurring pension expense incurred in connection with the acquisition of rosemont 
the increase in compared to was primarily due to increased compensation costs  partially offset by a decrease in legal fees litigation as compared to  when legal fees increased primarily due to the reactivation in the fourth quarter of of btg s declaratory judgment action against genentech in respect of btg s human growth hormone product in the united states 
cost of product sales was   and  in the years ended december   and  respectively 
cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales was  and in  and  respectively 
cost of product sales in increased in absolute terms and as a percentage of product sales due to increased sales  a change in the mix of products as compared to and the addition of rosemont s products  which have a higher cost of goods than most of the other btg products  in the fourth quarter of cost of product sales for include  of costs related to the rosemont products 
cost of product sales in increased in absolute terms as a result of increased product sales  but decreased as a percentage of product sales  primarily as a result of oxandrin accounting for a significant portion of the increase in product sales 
oxandrin has a relatively low cost of manufacture as a percentage of product sales  while biolon has the highest cost to manufacture as a percentage of product sales 
cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales varies from year to year and quarter to quarter depending on the quantity and mix of products sold

net proceeds from the sale of common stock resulted mainly from option exercises in and in both periods the issuances of stock pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan 
in  we repaid  of long term debt  principally borrowings under our credit facility that we used to finance a portion of the construction of our new manufacturing facility in israel 
cash flows from financing activities in were primarily affected by long term borrowings of  and proceeds from the issuance of common stock of  in april  btg purchased a manufacturing facility in israel for approximately  including local taxes and legal fees 
construction of a modern biologics production facility designed to meet fda cgmp requirements for biologics and devices was completed at the end of  and validation has commenced and is expected to be completed in the second half of btg will then commence the process validation for products manufactured in the existing facility to be transferred to the new facility 
production of these products cannot be relocated to the new facility until the new facility has received all necessary regulatory approvals  which btg anticipates will occur during the period from the end of through the end of  depending on product and territory 
through december   btg has spent approximately  to complete construction of the production facility including capitalized interest but excluding the cost of purchasing the facility and post completion validation  and expects to spend approximately  to complete validation activities  of which approximately  has been expended through december  in june btg israel entered into a  credit facility with bank hapoalim bm to finance a portion of the cost of completing its new manufacturing facility 
loans under the facility bear interest at the rate of libor plus 
the credit facility is secured by the assets of btg israel and has been guaranteed by btg 
at december   btg had outstanding long term borrowings of  under the facility  of which  is due in each of and  with the remaining  due in borrowings are repaid monthly in equal installments 
we believe that our cash resources as of december   together with anticipated product sales  will be sufficient to fund our ongoing operations for the foreseeable future 
there can  however  be no assurance that product sales will occur as anticipated  that current agreements with third party distributors of our products will not be canceled  that the chief scientist will continue to provide funding at current levels or at all  that we will not use a substantial portion of our cash resources to acquire businesses  products and or technologies  or that unanticipated events requiring the expenditure of funds will not occur 
the satisfaction of btg s future cash requirements will depend in large part on the status of commercialization of btg s products  btg s ability to enter into additional research and development and licensing arrangements  and btg s ability to obtain additional equity and debt financing  if necessary 
there can be no assurance that btg will be able to obtain additional funds or  if such funds are available  that such funding will be on favorable terms 
btg continues to seek additional collaborative research and development and licensing arrangements in order to provide revenue from sales of certain products and funding for a portion of the research and development expenses relating to the products covered  although there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain such agreements 
see item business risk factors we may be unable to obtain any additional capital needed to operate and grow our business and we expect our quarterly results to fluctuate  which may cause volatility in our stock price 
below is a table that presents our contractual obligations and commitments at december  we had no capital lease obligations or unconditional purchase commitments as of that date in thousands 
payments due by period contractual obligations total less than one year years years after years undetermined long term debt operating leases other long term obligations total contractual cash obligations consists of severance benefits payable under israeli law 
because these benefits are paid only upon termination of employment  it is not possible to allocate the liability across future years 
btg applies to the chief scientist of the state of israel annually for research and development funding for its various projects for the coming year 
the projects and amount funded each year are within the sole discretion of the chief scientist 
we are currently in discussions with the chief scientist about whether it will continue to fund some of our research and development activities  and we cannot assure you that the chief scientist will continue to provide funding to us at the same levels or at all 
btg is obligated to pay royalties to the chief scientist for products resulting from research and development partially funded by the chief scientist 
these royalties range from to on commercial sales  if any  of these products if produced in israel  up to the amount so funded  and to of commercial sales  if any  if these products are produced outside israel  up to to of the amount so funded

addresses accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we are currently assessing the impact of this new standard  although we do not expect it to affect our results of operations 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
sfas no 
will be applied to exit or disposal activities after december  and is not expected to have a material effect on btg s financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued statement  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement sfas  to provide alternative transition methods for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas amends the disclosure requirements of sfas to require prominent disclosures in annual financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the pro forma effect on reported results of applying the fair value based method for entities that use the intrinsic value method of accounting 
the pro forma effect disclosures are also required to be prominently disclosed in interim period financial statements 
this statement is effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after december  and is effective for financial reports containing condensed financial statements for interim periods beginning after december   with earlier application permitted 
btg does not plan a change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in november  fasb interpretation  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin  was issued 
fin requires a guarantor entity  at the inception of a guarantee covered by the measurement provisions of the interpretation  to record a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
btg previously did not record a liability when guaranteeing obligations unless it became probable that btg would have to perform under the guarantee 
fin applies prospectively to guarantees btg issues or modifies subsequent to december   but has certain disclosure requirements effective for interim and annual periods ending after december  btg has not yet determined the effects of fin on its financial statements 
disclosures required by fin are included in the accompanying financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
to date our exposure to market risk has been limited 
we do not currently hedge any market risk  although we may do so in the future 
we do not hold or issue any derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
in early  btg purchased forward contracts in the amount of  to hedge part of its commitments in israeli shekels  primarily salaries  by locking in the shekel us dollar exchange rate  which had become more volatile in late all of these contracts matured by july  in connection with the acquisition of rosemont  we entered into a forward contract for the delivery of the  purchase price on september  at a cost of  representing an exchange rate of per 
the exchange rate at the acquisition closing date was per in accordance with sfas  which prohibits hedge accounting for a hedge of an anticipated business combination  we recorded a gain of approximately  on the forward contract 
borrowings under our  credit facility bear interest at a floating rate and  therefore  we are impacted by changes in prevailing interest rates 
a basis point increase in market interest rates on the  outstanding under this facility at december  would result in an increase in our annual interest expense of  because these borrowings relate to the construction of our new facility  which is not yet ready for its intended use  interest expense is currently being capitalized 
our interest bearing assets consist of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  which currently consist primarily today of investments in commercial paper and time deposits 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates  primarily us interest rates and other market conditions 
as a result of our operations in israel and the united kingdom  we are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations that can affect our results of operations 
we manage our israeli operations with the objective of protecting against any material net financial loss in us dollars from the impact of israeli inflation and currency devaluations on its non us dollar assets and liabilities 
the cost of our operations in israel  as expressed in dollars  is influenced by the extent to which any increase in the rate of inflation in israel is not offset or is offset on a lagging basis by a devaluation of the israeli shekel in relation to the us dollar 
to the extent that expenses in shekels exceed btg israel s revenues in shekels which to date have consisted primarily of research funding from the chief scientist and product sales in israel  the devaluations of israeli currency have been and will continue to be a benefit to btg s financial condition 
however  should btg israel s revenues in shekels exceed its expenses in shekels in any material respect  the devaluation of the shekel will adversely affect btg s financial condition 
further  to the extent the devaluation of the shekel with respect to the us dollar does not substantially offset the increase in the costs of local goods and services in israel  btg s financial results will be adversely affected as local expenses measured in us dollars will increase
