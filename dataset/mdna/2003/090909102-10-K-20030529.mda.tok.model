item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations prospective investors are cautioned that the statements in this annual report on form k that are not descriptions of historical facts may be forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities reform act of  including statements concerning the company s future products  results of operations and prospects 
these forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those currently anticipated  including those relating to general economic and business conditions  the results of research and development efforts  technological changes and competition  potential changes in regulation by the fda  costs relating to manufacturing of products and the timing of customer orders detailed elsewhere in this annual report on form k and from time to time in the company s filings with the securities and exchange commission 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates the preparation of the company s financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
the items in the company s financial statements requiring significant estimates and judgments are as follows inventories  consisting principally of components  parts and supplies  are valued at the lower of cost or market  and include materials  labor and manufacturing overhead 
the company writes down inventory for estimated obsolescence for unmarketability equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market value  based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if future demands or market conditions were to be less favorable than what was projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
the company recognizes revenue upon shipment of its products to customers  provided that the company has received a signed purchase order  the price is fixed  the title has transferred  product returns are reasonably estimable  collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured  there are no customer acceptance requirements  and there are no remaining significant obligations 
the company maintains an allowance for estimated product returns based on historical experience 
the company also maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
this estimate is based on historical experience  current economic and industry conditions  and the financial condition of the customer 
if the financial condition of the customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
capitalized software costs for research and development are amortized over a five year period 
on an ongoing basis  management reviews the valuation of these software costs to determine if there has been impairment to the carrying value of these assets  and adjusts this value accordingly 
other significant accounting policies  not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above  are nevertheless important to an understanding of the financial statements 
policies relating to fair value of financial instruments  depreciation  and income taxes require judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple external sources of authoritative guidance such as the financial accounting standards board  securities and exchange commission  etc 
although no specific conclusions reached by these authorities appear likely to cause a material change in the company s accounting policies  outcome cannot be predicted with confidence 
also see note to the company s consolidated financial statements  which provides a summary of the company s significant accounting policies
