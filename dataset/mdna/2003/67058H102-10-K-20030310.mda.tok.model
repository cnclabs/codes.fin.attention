crude oil tank contribution the partnership has entered into two contribution agreements with valero energy pursuant to which  upon satisfaction of the closing conditions  valero energy will contribute crude oil and intermediate feedstock storage tanks and related assets to the partnership for  in cash 
the tank assets consist of all of the tank shells  foundations  tank valves  tank gauges  pressure equipment  temperature equipment  corrosion protection  leak detection  tank lighting and related equipment and appurtenances associated with the specified crude oil tanks and intermediate feedstock tanks located at valero energy s 
table of contents west plant of the corpus christi refinery in corpus christi  texas  which has a current total capacity to process  barrels per day of crude oil and other feedstocks  texas city refinery in texas city  texas  which has a current total capacity to process  barrels per day of crude oil and other feedstocks  and benicia refinery in benicia  california  which has a current total capacity to process  barrels per day of crude oil and other feedstocks 
the corpus christi refinery consists of two plants  the west plant and the east plant  with a combined total capacity to process  barrels per day of crude oil and other feedstocks 
since june  the date valero energy began operating the east plant  valero energy has operated both plants as one refinery 
unless otherwise indicated  references to the corpus christi refinery include both the west and the east plants 
historically  nearly all of the crude oil and intermediate feedstocks that are used in the west plant of the corpus christi refinery  the texas city refinery and the benicia refinery have passed through these tanks 
these feedstocks are held in the tanks or are segregated and blended to meet the refineries process requirements 
these tanks have approximately  barrels of storage capacity in the aggregate 
the following table reflects the number of crude oil and intermediate feedstock tanks and storage capacity  as well as mode of receipt and delivery  for each of the west plant of the corpus christi refinery  the texas city refinery and the benicia refinery 
number of tank location capacity tanks mode of receipt mode of delivery barrels corpus christi  tx west plant  marine pipeline texas city  tx  marine pipeline benicia  ca  marine pipeline pipeline total the tanks are  on average  approximately years old 
the tank assets have been well maintained and the partnership estimates that they have remaining useful lives of to years 
the crude oil tank contribution does not include a transfer of the refined product tanks or the land underlying the tank assets at these three refineries nor does it include any of the crude oil and other feedstock or refined product tankage currently owned by valero energy at the east plant of valero energy s corpus christi refinery or its other nine refineries 
the land on which the tank assets are located will be leased to valero logistics by valero energy for an aggregate of  per year 
the initial term of each lease will be years  subject to automatic renewal for successive one year periods thereafter 
the partnership may terminate any of these leases upon days notice after the initial term or at the end of the renewal period 
in addition  the partnership may terminate any of these leases upon days notice prior to the expiration of the current term if the partnership ceases to operate the tank assets or ceases business operations 

table of contents the following table sets forth the average daily throughput of the specified feedstocks crude oil  gas oil  residual fuel oil  vacuum gas oil  vacuum tower bottoms and light cycle oil for each of the west plant of the corpus christi refinery  the texas city refinery and the benicia refinery for the five year period ended december  years ended december  tank location barrels day corpus christi  tx west plant texas city  tx benicia  ca total average throughput valero energy acquired the benicia refinery on may  the throughput volumes for are based on the period from may  through december  throughputs of the specified feedstocks at these refineries vary from year to year as a result of market conditions and maintenance turnarounds  as well as increases in refinery capacities resulting from capital expenditures 
in  refined product inventories industry wide were high and imports of refined products were at record levels  resulting in unfavorable refining and marketing conditions 
according to the energy information agency  us refinery utilization in was of capacity compared to an average utilization of for the period of through as a result of these conditions  valero energy initiated economic based refinery production cuts  by as much as during certain times of the year  at certain of its refineries 
as refining margins increased in the latter half of  the refineries returned to normal operating levels  however  full year throughput levels were lower than in volumes at the west plant of the corpus christi refinery were negatively impacted by market conditions in and additionally  the west plant of the corpus christi refinery underwent maintenance turnaround for a period of days in that involved its heavy oil cracker 
volumes at the texas city refinery were adversely impacted in by market conditions and a day plant wide turnaround in which major units at the facility were expanded and upgraded 
however  in  volumes benefited from above average refining margins and high refinery production rates 
additionally  volumes were adversely impacted by maintenance and construction activities related to the expansion of two crude units 
volumes at the benicia refinery were adversely impacted by unplanned downtimes in there have been no major turnarounds needed since valero energy purchased this refinery in although this refinery is completing a capital project to convert its gasoline production to meet stricter california gasoline standards by the end of  the partnership does not believe that this project will materially impact volumes at this refinery 
valero energy does not have any significant turnarounds planned for at any of these refineries 
throughput fee 
in connection with the crude oil tank contribution  valero logistics and valero energy will enter into a handling and throughput agreement pursuant to which valero energy will agree to pay valero logistics a fee  for an initial period of ten years  for of specified feedstocks delivered to each of the west plant of the corpus christi refinery  the texas city refinery and the benicia refinery and to use valero logistics for handling all deliveries to these refineries as long as valero logistics is able to provide the handling and throughput services 
subject to force majeure and other exceptions  valero logistics will reimburse valero energy for the cost of substitute services should valero logistics not be able to provide these services 
valero logistics and valero energy will agree  pursuant to the handling and throughput agreement  to the following initial throughput fee per barrel for each barrel of the specified feedstocks received by these refineries 
table of contents throughput fee per barrel refinery for the year west plant of corpus christi texas city benicia for specified feedstocks delivered by valero logistics to these refineries after december   the throughput fee per barrel will be adjusted annually  generally based on of the regional consumer price index applicable to the location of each refinery 
the initial term of the handling and throughput agreement will be ten years and may be extended by valero energy for up to an additional five years 
operating expenses 
valero logistics will enter into services and secondment agreements with valero energy pursuant to which the partnership anticipates that employees  on a full time equivalent basis  of valero energy will be seconded to valero logistics to provide operating and routine maintenance services with respect to the tank assets under the direction  supervision and control of a designated employee of valero gp  llc performing services for valero logistics 
valero logistics will reimburse valero energy for the costs and expenses of the employees providing these operating and routine maintenance services 
the annual reimbursement for services is an aggregate  for the year following closing and will be subject to adjustment for the actual operating and routine maintenance costs and expenses incurred and increases in the regional consumer price index 
in addition  the partnership has agreed to pay valero energy  a year for the lease of the real property on which the tank assets are located 
in addition  the annual services reimbursement may be adjusted downward if the actual costs for the services provided by valero energy are lower 
the initial terms of the services and secondment agreements will be ten years with an option to extend for an additional five years 
valero logistics may terminate these agreements upon days written notice 
in addition to the fees the partnership has agreed to pay valero energy under the services and secondment agreement  the partnership will be responsible for operating expenses and specified capital expenditures related to the tank assets that are not addressed in the services and secondment agreement 
these operating expenses and capital expenditures include tank safety inspections  maintenance and repairs  certain environmental expenses  insurance premiums and ad valorem taxes 
based on the partnership s experience operating and maintaining similar assets and the partnership s knowledge of these assets  the partnership estimates that tank safety inspections  maintenance and repairs will initially cost approximately  per year  environmental expenses  insurance premiums and ad valorem taxes will initially be approximately  per year  and maintenance capital expenditures will initially be approximately  per year 
the operating expenses and maintenance capital expenditures that are not addressed in the services and secondment agreement are estimates only  even though they are based on assumptions made by the partnership based on its experience operating and maintaining similar assets and the partnership s knowledge of these assets 
should the partnership s assumptions and expectations related to these operating expenses differ materially from actual future results  the partnership may not be able to generate net income sufficient to sustain an increase in available cash per unit at the currently expected levels or at all 
environmental indemnification 
in connection with the crude oil tank contribution  valero energy has agreed to indemnify the partnership from environmental liabilities related to the tank assets that arose as a result of events occurring or conditions existing prior to the closing of the crude oil tank contribution  any real or personal property on which the tank assets are located that arose prior to the closing of the crude oil tank contribution  and any actions taken by valero energy before  on or after the closing of the crude oil tank contribution  in connection with the ownership  use or operation of the west plant of the corpus christi refinery  the texas city 
table of contents refinery and the benicia refinery or the property on which the tank assets are located  or any accident or occurrence in connection therewith 
no historical financial information 
historically  the tank assets have been operated as part of valero energy s refining operations and  as a result  no separate fee has been charged related to these assets and  accordingly  no revenues related to these assets have been recorded 
the tank assets have not been accounted for separately and have not been operated as an autonomous business unit 
instead  they have been operated as part of business units that comprise part of valero energy s refining operations  and operating decisions have been made to maximize the overall profits of the refining businesses rather than the profits of any individual refinery asset such as the tank assets 
the partnership intends to manage and operate the tank assets to maximize revenues and cash available for distribution to its unitholders by charging valero energy and third parties a market based throughput fee 
financial impact 
based on historical throughput volumes for the year ended december  and throughput fees for the year as agreed upon with valero energy  our aggregate revenues for the tank assets would have been approximately million for the year ended december  many factors could cause future results to differ from expected results  including a decline in valero energy s refining throughput  due to market conditions or otherwise  at the west plant of the corpus christi refinery  the texas city refinery or the benicia refinery 
conflicts committee approval 
the crude oil tank contribution has been approved by a conflicts committee of the board of directors of valero gp  llc based on an opinion from its independent financial advisor that the consideration to be paid by the partnership pursuant to the contribution agreement related to the crude oil tank contribution is fair  from a financial point of view  to the partnership and its public unitholders 
under the terms of the contribution agreements  the crude oil tank contribution is subject to customary closing conditions  including the absence of any material adverse change in the condition of the tank assets  the partnership s ability to obtain financing and consummation of the redemption transaction 
south texas pipeline contribution the partnership has entered into a contribution agreement with valero energy pursuant to which  upon satisfaction of the closing conditions  valero energy will contribute the south texas pipeline system  comprised of the houston pipeline system  the san antonio pipeline system and the valley pipeline system and related terminalling assets  to the partnership for  in cash 
the three pipeline systems that make up the south texas pipeline assets are intrastate common carrier refined product pipelines that connect valero energy s corpus christi refinery to the houston and rio grande valley  texas markets and connect valero energy s three rivers refinery to the san antonio  texas market and to valero energy s corpus christi refinery 
the san antonio pipeline system the pettus to san antonio and the pettus to corpus christi refined product pipelines connects with the three rivers to pettus refined product pipelines already owned by the partnership 
the san antonio pipeline system delivers refined products to the san antonio and corpus christi  texas markets that it receives through the two existing pipelines 
each of the three intrastate pipelines is subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the texas railroad commission 
on june   valero energy and subsidiaries of el paso corporation consummated two capital leases with an associated purchase option with respect to the east plant of the corpus christi refinery and the related south texas pipeline and terminal assets 
valero energy has been operating these assets since that date 
on february   valero energy exercised the purchase option for approximately  in cash

san antonio pipeline system 
the san antonio pipeline system is comprised of two segments the north segment  which runs from pettus to san antonio and the south segment  which runs from pettus to corpus christi 
the north segment originates in pettus  texas  where it connects to the partnership s existing inch three rivers to pettus refined product pipeline and terminates in san antonio  texas at the san antonio refined product terminal 
this san antonio refined product terminal  which has approximately  barrels of storage capacity and an associated truck loading rack  is separate from the san antonio terminal currently owned by the partnership 
the north segment is miles long and consists of inch and inch pipeline segments with a capacity of approximately  barrels per day 
this pipeline segment transports refined products from the three rivers refinery  located between corpus christi and san antonio to the san antonio refined product terminal 
the south segment originates in pettus  texas  where it connects to the partnership s existing inch three rivers to pettus refined product pipeline and terminates in corpus christi  texas at valero energy s corpus christi refinery 
the south segment is miles long and consists of inch  inch  inch and inch pipeline segments with a capacity of approximately  barrels per day 
this pipeline segment transports distillates and blendstocks  primarily raffinate  from the three rivers refinery to the corpus christi refinery 
valero energy is the only shipper in both segments of the san antonio pipeline system 
although it is possible to operate the two segments of the san antonio pipeline as a continuous pipeline from corpus christi to san antonio  this is rarely done and the partnership has no present intention to do so 
valley pipeline system 
the valley pipeline system contains the corpus christi to edinburg refined product pipeline and the edinburg refined product terminal 
this pipeline is a refined product pipeline that consists of inch and inch segments and extends miles from corpus christi  texas to edinburg  texas 
the capacity of the corpus christi to edinburg refined product pipeline was expanded in from  barrels per day to approximately  barrels per day 
refined products shipped on the valley pipeline system are distributed in the southern rio grande valley area of texas  which includes the cities of edinburg and mcallen  texas with occasional spot sales to petr leos mexicanos pemex for distribution in mexico

table of contents environmental and other indemnification 
in connection with the south texas pipeline contribution  valero energy has agreed to indemnify the partnership from environmental liabilities related to the south texas pipelines and terminals that arose as a result of events occurring or conditions existing prior to the closing of the south texas pipeline contribution  and any real or personal property on which the south texas pipelines and terminals are located that arose prior to the closing of the south texas pipeline contribution  that are known at closing or are discovered within years after the closing of the south texas pipeline contribution 
valero energy is currently addressing soil or groundwater contamination at sites associated with the south texas pipelines and terminals through assessment  monitoring and remediation programs with oversight by the applicable state agencies 
in the aggregate  the partnership has estimated that the total liability for remediating these sites will not exceed  although there can be no guarantee that the actual remedial costs or associated liabilities will not exceed this amount 
valero energy has agreed to indemnify the partnership for these liabilities 
valero energy has indicated to the partnership that the segment of the corpus christi to edinburg refined product pipeline that runs approximately miles south from corpus christi to seeligson station may require repair and  in some places  replacement 
valero energy has agreed to indemnify the partnership for any costs the partnership incurs to repair and replace this segment in excess of  which is approximately the amount of capital expenditures the partnership expects to spend on this segment for the next three years 
throughput commitment agreement 
pursuant to the south texas pipelines and terminals throughput commitment agreement  valero energy will commit  during each quarterly measurement period  for an initial period of seven years to transport in the houston and valley pipeline systems an aggregate of of the corpus christi gasoline and distillate production but only if the combined throughput on these pipelines is less than  barrels per day  to transport in the pettus to san antonio refined product pipeline of the three rivers gasoline and distillate production and in the pettus to corpus christi refined product pipeline of the three rivers raffinate production  to use the houston asphalt terminal for an aggregate of of the asphalt production of the corpus christi refinery  to use the edinburg refined product terminal for an aggregate of of the gasoline and distillate production of the corpus christi refinery  but only if the throughput at this terminal is less than  barrels per day  and to use the san antonio terminal for of the throughput in the pettus to san antonio refined product pipeline 
the minimum commitment percentages detailed above are lower than the percentages of refined products transported through each of these assets in with the exception of the houston asphalt terminal  valero energy s commitments reflect or more of the actual percentages in valero energy s commitment at the houston asphalt terminal reflects approximately of the actual throughput of this terminal in in the event valero energy does not transport in the partnership s pipelines or use the partnership s terminals to handle the minimum volume requirements and if its obligation has not been suspended under the terms of the agreement  it will be required to make a cash payment determined by multiplying the shortfall in volume by the applicable weighted average tariff rate or terminal fee 
also  valero energy agreed to allow the partnership to increase its tariff to compensate for any revenue shortfall in the event the partnership has to curtail throughput on the corpus christi to edinburg refined product pipeline as a result of repair and replacement activities 
terminalling agreement 
pursuant to the terminalling agreement  valero energy will pay the partnership a terminalling fee of per barrel for all diesel fuel  motor fuel and jet fuel  per barrel for all conventional asphalt  and per barrel for all modified grade asphalt 
table of contents stored or handled by or on behalf of valero energy at the terminals associated with the south texas pipeline systems 
in addition to the terminalling fee  valero energy will pay the partnership a per barrel additive fee for generic gasoline additives should valero energy elect to receive these additives in the products 
if valero energy or its customers elect to directly supply a proprietary additive  valero energy will pay the partnership an additive handling fee of per barrel 
this additive fee applies to all terminals associated with the south texas pipeline systems other than the hobby airport refined products terminal and the houston asphalt terminal 
valero energy will pay the partnership a per barrel filtering fee for products stores or handled at the hobby airport refined product terminal 
the initial term of the terminalling agreement will be five years  subject to automatic renewal for successive one year periods thereafter 
either party may terminate the terminalling agreement after the initial term upon days notice at the end of a renewal term 
conflicts committee approval 
the south texas pipeline contribution has been approved by a conflicts committee of the board of directors of valero gp  llc based on an opinion from its independent financial advisor that the consideration to be paid by the partnership pursuant to the contribution agreement related to the south texas pipeline contribution is fair  from a financial point of view  to the partnership and its public unitholders 
under the terms of the contribution agreement  the south texas pipeline contribution is subject to customary closing conditions  including the absence of any material adverse change in the condition of the pipelines and terminals and the partnership s ability to obtain financing 
redemption of common units owned by valero energy and amendment to partnership agreement common unit redemption 
the partnership intends to redeem from valero energy as many common units as is sufficient to reduce valero energy s aggregate ownership percentage in the partnership to or less 
the redemption transaction is conditioned upon the partnership s ability to obtain financing for the proposed redemption  the crude oil tank contribution and the south texas pipeline contribution 
if the partnership is able to obtain financing for each these transactions  the common units will be redeemed prior to the closing of the asset transactions 
immediately following the redemption  the partnership will cancel the common units redeemed from valero energy 
amendment to partnership agreement 
immediately upon closing of the redemption transaction  the partnership will amend its partnership agreement to provide that its general partner may be removed by the vote of the holders of at least of the partnership s outstanding common units and subordinated units  excluding the common units and subordinated units held by affiliates of its general partner 
the partnership will also amend its partnership agreement to provide that the election of a successor general partner upon any such removal be approved by the holders of a majority of the common units  excluding the common units held by affiliates of the partnership s general partner 
currently  the partnership agreement provides that the partnership s general partner may be removed by the vote of the holders of at least of the outstanding common units and subordinated units  including the common units and subordinated units held by affiliates of the partnership s general partner  which effectively allows valero energy to block removal of the general partner by virtue of its indirect ownership of approximately of the partnership s outstanding common units and subordinated units 
furthermore  the partnership agreement currently provides that any removal is conditioned upon the election of a successor general partner by the holders of a majority of the common units  voting as a separate class  and by the holders of a majority of the subordinated units  voting as a separate class  including the units held by affiliates of the partnership s general partner 
if the partnership s general partner is removed without cause during the subordination period and units held by the general partner or its affiliates are not voted in favor of that removal  all remaining subordinated units will automatically be converted into common units and any existing arrearages on the common units will extinguished 
cause is narrowly defined to mean that a court of competent jurisdiction has entered into a final  non appealable judgment finding the general partner liable for actual fraud  gross negligence  or willful or wanton misconduct in its capacity as the partnership s general partner 

table of contents maintenance the partnership performs scheduled maintenance on all of its pipelines  terminals and related equipment and makes repairs and replacements when necessary or appropriate 
the partnership believes that all of its pipelines  terminals and related equipment have been constructed and are maintained in all material respects in accordance with applicable federal  state and local laws and the regulations and standards prescribed by the american petroleum institute  the department of transportation and accepted industry practice 
competition as a result of the partnership s physical integration with valero energy s mckee  three rivers and ardmore refineries and its contractual relationship with valero energy  the partnership believes that it will not face significant competition for barrels of crude oil transported to  and barrels of refined products transported from  the mckee  three rivers and ardmore refineries  particularly during the term of the pipelines and terminals usage agreement with valero energy 
however  the partnership faces competition from other pipelines that may be able to supply valero energy s end user markets with refined products on a more competitive basis 
if valero energy reduced its retail sales of refined products or its wholesale customers reduced their purchases of refined products  the volumes transported through the partnership s pipelines would be reduced  which would cause a decrease in cash and revenues generated from its operations 
valero energy owns or leases certain pipelines that deliver crude oil and refined products to markets served by the partnership s pipelines and terminals 
specifically  valero energy owns a refined product pipeline that runs from its corpus christi  texas refinery to edinburg  texas 
valero energy s edinburg refined product terminal serves markets that are also served by the partnership s harlingen refined product terminal 
also  valero energy owns two refined product pipelines that run from pettus to corpus christi and from pettus to san antonio 
as discussed above in items and business and properties  recent developments south texas pipeline contributions  the partnership has an agreement to acquire the corpus christi to edinburg refined products pipeline  the edinburg refined product terminal  the pettus to san antonio refined product pipeline  the pettus to corpus christi refined product pipeline and the san antonio refined product terminal 
in addition  valero energy owns certain crude oil gathering systems that deliver crude oil to the mckee refinery 
the texas and oklahoma markets served by the refined product pipelines originating at the three rivers and ardmore refineries are accessible by texas gulf coast refiners through common carrier pipelines  with the exception of the laredo  texas and nuevo laredo  mexico markets 
the nuevo laredo  mexico market is accessible by refineries operated by pemex 
in addition  the markets served by the refined product pipelines originating at the mckee refinery are also accessible by texas gulf coast and midwestern refiners through common carrier pipelines 
the partnership believes that high capital requirements  environmental and safety considerations and the difficulty in acquiring rights of way and related permits make it difficult for other entities to build competing pipelines in areas served by its pipelines 
as a result  competing pipelines are likely to be built only in those cases in which strong market demand and attractive tariff rates support additional capacity in an area 
the partnership knows of two refined product pipelines that are in various stages of completion that may serve its market areas the longhorn pipeline is a common carrier refined product pipeline with an initial capacity of  barrels per day 
it will be capable of delivering refined products from the texas gulf coast to el paso  texas 
most of the pipeline has been constructed and startup is expected to occur before the end of the partnership expects that a portion of the refined products transported into the el paso area in the longhorn pipeline will ultimately be transported into the phoenix and tucson  arizona markets via sfpp  lp s east pipeline the sfpp east line  which is currently capacity constrained 
as a result of these constraints  valero energy s allocated capacity in the sfpp east line may be reduced 
sfpp  lp has proposed to expand the sfpp east line  and if it proceeds with the expansion  the expanded pipeline should alleviate the existing capacity constraints and could increase demand for transportation of refined products from mckee to el paso 
however  the increased supply of refined products entering the el paso and arizona markets through the longhorn pipeline and the likely increase in the cost of shipping product on sfpp east line could also cause a decline in the demand for refined products from valero energy 
in either case  the demand for transportation of refined products from mckee to el paso might be reduced

refined products would be transported from west texas to the bloomfield  new mexico area 
the project would also require new pipeline connections on the southern and northern ends of the project 
this project also includes a new refined product terminal near albuquerque  new mexico 
this proposed odessa to bloomfield refined product pipeline could cause a reduction in demand for the transportation of refined products to the albuquerque market in the partnership s refined product pipeline 
this proposed shell refined product pipeline would also cross two of the partnership s refined product pipelines  the mckee to el paso refined product pipeline and the amarillo to albuquerque refined product pipeline 
although construction has not yet commenced on this project  it is anticipated to be completed in given the expected increase in demand for refined products in the southwestern and rocky mountain market regions  the partnership does not believe that these new refined product pipelines  when fully operational  will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
general rate regulation prior to july  affiliates of valero energy owned and operated the partnership s pipelines 
these affiliates were the only shippers in most of the pipelines  including the common carrier pipelines 
in preparation for valero lp s initial public offering  valero lp filed revised tariff rates with the appropriate regulatory commissions to adjust the tariff rates on many of its pipelines to better reflect current throughput volumes and market conditions or cost based pricing 
also in connection with its initial public offering  valero lp obtained the agreement of valero energy  which is the only shipper in most of the pipelines  not to challenge the validity of the tariff rates until at least april  interstate rate regulation the federal energy regulatory commission ferc regulates the rates and practices of common carrier petroleum pipelines  which include crude oil  petroleum product and petrochemical pipelines  engaged in interstate transportation under the interstate commerce act 
the interstate commerce act and its implementing regulations require that the tariff rates and practices for interstate oil pipelines be just and reasonable and non discriminatory 
the interstate commerce act permits challenges to proposed new or changed rates or practices by protest and challenges to rates and practices that are already on file and in effect by complaint 
upon the appropriate showing  a successful complainant may obtain damages or reparations for generally up to two years prior to the filing of a complaint 
valero energy has agreed to be responsible for any interstate commerce act liabilities with respect to activities or conduct occurring during periods prior to april   and the partnership will be responsible for interstate commerce act liabilities with respect to activities or conduct occurring after april  the ferc is authorized to suspend the effectiveness of a new or changed tariff rate for a period of up to seven months and to investigate the rate 
the ferc may also place into effect a new or changed tariff rate on at least one days notice  subject to refund and investigation 
if upon the completion of an investigation the ferc finds that the rate is unlawful  it may require the pipeline operator to refund to shippers  with interest  any difference between the rates the ferc determines to be lawful and the rates under investigation 
in addition  the ferc will order the pipeline to change its rates prospectively to the lawful level 
in general  petroleum pipeline rates must be cost based  although settlement rates  which are rates that have been agreed to by all shippers  are permitted  and market based rates may be permitted in certain circumstances 
energy policy act of and subsequent developments the energy policy act deemed certain interstate petroleum pipeline rates that were in effect on the date of enactment of the energy policy act  to be just and reasonable ie  grandfathered under the interstate commerce act 
some of the partnership s pipeline rates were grandfathered under the energy policy act  which has the benefit of making those rates more difficult to challenge 
the energy policy act further required ferc to issue rules establishing a simplified and generally applicable ratemaking methodology for interstate petroleum pipelines and to streamline procedures in petroleum pipeline proceedings 
ferc responded to this mandate by adopting a new indexing rate methodology for interstate petroleum pipelines 
under these regulations  effective january   petroleum pipelines are able to change their rates within prescribed ranges that are tied to changes in the producer price index for finished goods ppi  minus one percent 
the new indexing methodology 
table of contents is applicable to any existing rates  including grandfathered rates  and the scope of any challenges to rate increases made under the indexing methodology are limited 
as a result of ferc s reassessment of this index and certain court litigation  on february   ferc changed the index to equal the ppi 
under ferc s february  order  pipelines may file to change their tariff rates to reflect the applicable ceiling levels bases on the ppi  calculated as though this index had been in effect from july  intrastate rate regulation the rates and practices for the partnership s intrastate common carrier pipelines are subject to regulation by the texas railroad commission and the colorado public utility commission 
the applicable state statutes and regulations generally require that pipeline rates and practices be reasonable and non discriminatory 
the partnership s pipelines rates neither the ferc nor the state commissions have investigated the partnership s rates or practices 
the partnership does not believe that it is likely that there will be a challenge to its rates by a current shipper that would materially affect its revenues or cash flows because valero energy is the only current shipper in substantially all of the partnership s pipelines 
valero energy has committed not to challenge the partnership s rates until at least april however  the ferc or a state regulatory commission could investigate the partnership s tariff rates at the urging of a third party 
also  because the partnership s pipelines are common carrier pipelines  the partnership may be required to accept new shippers who wish to transport in its pipelines 
it is possible that any new shippers may decide to challenge the partnership s tariff rates 
if a rate were challenged  the partnership would seek to either rely on a cost of service justification or to establish that  due to the presence of competing alternatives to its pipeline  the tariff rate should be a market based rate 
although no assurance can be given that the partnership s intrastate rates would ultimately be upheld if challenged  it believes that the tariffs now in effect are not likely to be challenged 
however  if any rate challenge or challenges were successful  cash available for distribution to unitholders could be materially reduced 
environmental regulation general the partnership s operations are subject to extensive federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations  including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment  waste management and pollution prevention measures  and to environmental regulation by several federal  state and local authorities 
the principal environmental risks associated with the partnership s operations relate to unauthorized emissions into the air and unauthorized releases into soil  surface water or groundwater 
the partnership s operations are also subject to extensive federal and state health and safety laws and regulations  including those relating to pipeline safety 
compliance with these laws  regulations and permits increases the partnership s capital expenditures and its overall costs of business 
however  violations of these laws  regulations and or permits can result in significant civil and criminal liabilities  injunctions or other penalties 
accordingly  the partnership has adopted policies  practices and procedures in the areas of pollution control  product safety  occupational health and the handling  storage  use and disposal of hazardous materials in an effort to prevent material environmental or other damage  and to ensure the safety of its pipelines  its employees  the public and the environment 
future governmental action and regulatory initiatives could result in changes to expected operating permits  additional remedial actions or increased capital expenditures and operating costs that cannot be assessed with certainty at this time 
in addition  contamination resulting from spills of crude oil and refined products occurs within the industry 
risks of additional costs and liabilities are inherent within the industry  and there can be no assurances that significant costs and liabilities will not be incurred in the future 
in connection with the initial public offering of valero lp on april  and the partnership s acquisition of crude oil and refined products pipeline and terminalling assets from valero energy s predecessor  valero energy agreed to indemnify the partnership for environmental liabilities that arose prior to april  and are discovered within years after april  excluded from this indemnification are costs that arise from changes in environmental law after april  in addition  as an operator or owner of the assets  the partnership could be held liable for pre april  environmental damage should valero energy be unable to fulfill its obligation 
as of december   the partnership has not incurred any material environmental liabilities that were not covered by the environmental indemnification 

table of contents water the oil pollution act was enacted in and amends provisions of the federal water pollution control act of  also referred to as the clean water act  and other statutes as they pertain to prevention and response to petroleum spills 
the oil pollution act subjects owners of facilities to strict  joint and potentially unlimited liability for removal costs and other consequences of a petroleum spill  where the spill is into navigable waters  along shorelines or in the exclusive economic zone of the us in the event of a petroleum spill into navigable waters  substantial liabilities could be imposed upon the partnership 
states in which the partnership operates have also enacted similar laws 
regulations developed under the oil pollution act and state laws may also impose additional regulatory burdens on the partnership s operations 
spill prevention control and countermeasure requirements of federal laws and some state laws require diking  booms and similar structures to help prevent contamination of navigable waters in the event of a petroleum overflow  rupture or leak 
in addition  these laws require  in some instances  the development of spill prevention control and countermeasure plans 
additionally  the united states department of transportation s office of pipeline safety ops has approved the partnership s petroleum spill emergency response plans 
the clean water act imposes restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into navigable waters 
permits must be obtained to discharge pollutants into federal and state waters 
the clean water act imposes substantial potential liability for the costs of removal  remediation and damages 
in addition  some states maintain groundwater protection programs that require permits for discharges or operations that may impact groundwater conditions 
air emissions the partnership s operations are subject to the federal clean air act and comparable state and local statutes 
amendments to the federal clean air act enacted in late require most industrial operations in the us to incur capital expenditures in order to meet air emission control standards developed by the environmental protection agency and state environmental agencies 
in addition  title v of the federal clean air act amendments created a new operating permit program for major sources  which applies to some of the partnership s facilities 
the partnership will be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the next several years for air pollution control equipment in connection with maintaining or obtaining permits and approvals addressing air emission related issues 
solid waste the partnership generates non hazardous solid wastes that are subject to the requirements of the federal resource conservation and recovery act and comparable state statutes 
the federal resource conservation and recovery act also governs the disposal of hazardous wastes 
the partnership is not currently required to comply with a substantial portion of the federal resource conservation and recovery act requirements because its operations generate minimal quantities of hazardous wastes 
however  it is possible that additional wastes  which could include wastes currently generated during operations  will in the future be designated as hazardous wastes 
hazardous wastes are subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements than are non hazardous wastes 
hazardous substances the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  referred to as cercla  also known as superfund  imposes liability  without regard to fault or the legality of the original act  on some classes of persons that contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment 
these persons include the owner or operator of the site and entities that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site 
cercla also authorizes the environmental protection agency and  in some instances  third parties to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs that they incur 
in the course of the partnership s ordinary operations  it may generate waste that falls within cercla s definition of a hazardous substance 
while the partnership responsibly manages the hazardous substances that it controls  the intervening acts of third parties may expose the partnership to joint and several liability under cercla for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which these hazardous substances have been disposed of or released into the environment 
the partnership currently owns or leases  and has in the past owned or leased  properties where hydrocarbons are being or have been handled 
although the partnership has utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time  hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned or leased by the partnership or on or under other locations where these wastes have been taken for disposal 
in addition  many of these properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes was not under the partnership s control 
these properties and wastes disposed thereon may be subject to cercla  the federal resource conservation and recovery act and analogous state laws 
under these 
table of contents laws  the partnership could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators  to clean up contaminated property including contaminated groundwater or to perform remedial operations to prevent future contamination 
endangered species act the endangered species act restricts activities that may affect endangered species or their habitats 
the discovery of previously unidentified endangered species could cause the partnership to incur additional costs or operational restrictions or bans in the affected area 
hazardous materials transportation requirements ops has promulgated extensive regulations governing pipeline safety 
these regulations generally require pipeline operators to implement measures designed to reduce the environmental impact from onshore crude oil and refined product pipeline releases and to maintain comprehensive spill response plans  including extensive spill response training certifications for pipeline personnel 
these regulations also require pipeline operators to develop qualification programs for individuals performing covered tasks on pipeline facilities to ensure there is a qualified work force and to reduce the risk of accidents from human error 
in addition  ops regulations contain detailed specifications for pipeline operation and maintenance  such as the implementation of integrity management programs that continually assess the integrity of pipelines in high consequence areas such as areas with concentrated populations  navigable waterways or other unusually sensitive areas 
in addition to federal regulations  some states  including texas and oklahoma  have certified state pipeline safety programs governing intrastate pipelines 
other states  such as new mexico  have entered into agreements with ops to help implement safety regulations on intrastate pipelines 
pipeline safety improvement act of in december  the pipeline safety improvement act of the act was enacted 
the act expands the government s regulatory authority over pipeline safety and  among other things  requires pipeline operators to maintain qualification programs for key pipeline operating personnel  to review and update their existing pipeline safety public education programs  and to provide information for the national pipeline mapping system 
the act also strengthens the national one call system  which is intended to minimize the risk of pipelines being damaged by third party excavators and provides whistleblower protection to pipeline employees and contractors who identify pipeline safety risks 
some of the act s requirements are effective immediately  while other requirements will become effective during and the partnership believes that it is in substantial compliance with the act  and will continue to be in substantial compliance with the act following the effectiveness of these other requirements 
in addition  while this act may affect the partnership s maintenance capital expenditures and operating expenses  the partnership believes that the act does not affect its competitive position and will not have a material affect on its financial conditions or results of operations 
osha the partnership is subject to the requirements of the federal occupational safety and health act and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers 
in addition  the federal occupational safety and health act hazard communication standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees  state and local government authorities and citizens 
title to properties the partnership believes that it has satisfactory title to all of its assets 
although title to these properties is subject to encumbrances in some cases  such as customary interests generally retained in connection with acquisition of real property  liens related to environmental liabilities associated with historical operations  liens for current taxes and other burdens and minor easements  restrictions and other encumbrances to which the underlying properties were subject at the time of acquisition by the partnership or its predecessors  the partnership believes that none of these burdens will materially detract from the value of these properties or from its interest in these properties or will materially interfere with their use in the operation of the partnership s business 
in addition  the partnership believes that it has obtained sufficient rights of way grants and permits from public authorities and private parties for it to operate its business in all material respects as described in this report
