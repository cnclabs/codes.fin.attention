the total of billion will be available for the future issuance of other debt and or equity securities depending on the company s needs and market conditions

critical accounting and other policies a critical accounting policy is one that is important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition  results of operations or liquidity  and requires management to make difficult and or complex judgments 
critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown 
the following discussion represents management s view of accounting policies and practices that are critical for the company 
oil and gas accounting the company follows the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas activities 
acquisition and development costs of proved properties are capitalized and each is amortized on a units of production basis over the remaining life of proved and proved developed reserves  respectively 
if reserve estimates are revised downward  earnings could be affected by higher depreciation and depletion expense or an immediate write down of the property s book value see impairments discussion below 
another element that is critical and could cause material fluctuations in earnings relates to the disposition of exploratory oil and gas well expenditures under successful efforts accounting 
if an exploratory well results in the discovery of commercial reserves  the well investment is transferred to proved properties at the time the reserves are booked 
exploratory wells that are non commercial are expensed as dry hole costs 
acquisition costs of exploratory acreage are capitalized when incurred 
such costs related to the portion of properties expected to be noncommercial  based on exploratory experience and judgment  are amortized for impairment over the shorter of the exploratory period or the lease concession holding period 
oil and gas reserves estimates of physical quantities of oil and gas reserves are determined by company engineers and in some cases by third party experts 
proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
accordingly  these estimates do not include probable or possible reserves 
estimated oil and gas reserves are based on available reservoir data and are subject to future revision 
significant portions of the company s undeveloped reserves  principally in offshore areas  require the installation or completion of related infrastructure facilities such as platforms  pipelines  and the drilling of development wells 
proved reserve quantities exclude royalty and other interests owned by others 
the company reports all reserves held under pscs utilizing the economic interest method  which excludes host country shares 
estimated quantities for pscs reported under the economic interest method are subject to fluctuations in the price of oil and gas and recoverable operating expenses and capital costs 
if costs remain stable  reserve quantities attributable to recovery of costs will change inversely to changes in commodity prices 
this change would be partially offset by a change in the company s net equity share 
impairment of assets oil and gas developed and undeveloped properties are regularly assessed for possible impairment  generally on a field by field basis where applicable  using the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of each field 
impairment losses are recognized when the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the current net book values of the properties in a field 
the measurement amount to be recorded is based on expected discounted future cash flows 
the expected future cash flows are estimated based on management s plans to continue to produce and develop proved and associated risk adjusted probable and possible reserves 
expected future cash flows from the sale or production of reserves are calculated based on management s best estimate of future oil and gas prices using market based information 
different views of future commodity prices could have a significant impact on whether the company records asset impairments 
the estimated future level of production is based on assumptions surrounding future commodity prices  lifting and development costs  field decline rates  market demand and supply  the economic regulatory climates and other factors 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report for details on impairments 
post employment benefits the company utilizes us generally accepted accounting principles  as promulgated by the financial accounting standards board  to recognize the projected benefit obligations associated with pension and health care plans and for recording the costs of such plans in its income statement 
the actuarial determination of projected benefit obligations pbo and related costs involves considerable judgment concerning events that are expected to occur over varying lengths of time in the future 
some of the key variables that impact measurement include future salary growth  estimated employee turnover rates and retirement dates  mortality  lump sum election rates  long term rates of return on plan assets  interest discount rates  initial and long term cost trend rates and retiree utilization rates for health care services 
due to the complex and specialized nature of these calculations  the company engages the services of outside actuarial firms to assist in the determination of these obligations and their related costs 
the recent decline in interest rates  to near year lows  and lower market returns on plan assets have negatively impacted the company s benefit plans 
while no cash contributions have been required in recent years the low interest rates and market returns have increased pension and other related retirement benefit expenses 
the company and its actuaries utilize both forecasted and historical data to adjust assumptions 
assumed interest discount rates reflect the rates at which pension benefits can be effectively settled 
the company has little leeway in selecting a discount rate as such rates are required to reflect rates implicit in current annuity contracts and or current market rates for high quality fixed income investments 
a lower discount rate increases both the present value of benefit obligations and pension expense 
for the company s principal plans  a basis point decrease in the discount rate  with all other assumptions held constant  would have increased the pbo by approximately million at december  and would increase pre tax pension expense for by approximately million 
the expected rate of return on plan assets roa reflects the average rate of returns expected on funds invested to provide the projected benefits 
by definition the roa is an estimate of long term returns 
the company considers both current and expected asset allocations as well as historical and forecasted returns on all categories of plan assets when selecting an roa 
a basis point decrease in the expected return on the assets of the company s principal pension plans  with all other assumptions held constant  would increase pretax pension expense million in interest rates  asset returns and inflation have varied significantly over time and are likely to continue to do so in the future 
likewise  actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of changes in plan benefits and terms plus legal  economic and other factors 
in the company recognized a minimum pension liability of million reflecting the excess of the accumulated benefit obligation abo over the fair value of plan assets at december   for its qualified retirement plan covering current and former us payroll employees 
the recognition of this liability resulted in an after tax charge of million to the other comprehensive income oci component of stockholders equity 
if in subsequent years returns on plan assets improve and or interest rates rise the fair value of plan assets may again exceed the abo 
if and when this occurs  the liability will be reversed and a pre paid pension cost asset will be re established on the balance sheet with the offsetting credit booked to oci 
the company was not required to make any contributions to the plan in nor will it be required to make any contributions in or however  continued poor returns on plan assets could accelerate the requirement to make cash contributions to the plan after the company may elect  however  to make voluntary cash contributions to the plan at any time 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report for additional disclosures on the company s various post employment benefit plans 
environmental and litigation company management also makes judgments and estimates pursuant to applicable accounting rules in recording costs and establishing reserves for environmental clean up and remediation and potential costs of litigation matters 
for environmental reserves  actual costs can differ from estimates because of changes in laws and regulations  discovery and analysis of site conditions and changes in clean up technology 
for additional details  refer to the ensuing environmental matters discussion and notes and to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
actual litigation costs can vary from estimates based on the facts and circumstances in the application of laws in the individual cases 
environmental matters unocal is committed to operating its business in a manner that is environmentally responsible 
this commitment is fundamental to the company s core values 
as a part of this commitment  the company has procedures in place to audit and monitor its environmental performance 
in addition  unocal has implemented programs to identify and address environmental risks throughout the company 
consequently  the company continues to incur substantial capital and operating expenditures for environmental protection and to comply with federal  state and local laws  as well as foreign laws  regulating the discharge of materials into the environment and management of hazardous and other waste materials 
in many cases  investigatory or remedial work is now required at various sites even though past operations followed practices and procedures that were considered acceptable under environmental laws and regulations  if any  existing at the time 
estimated years ended december  millions of dollars environmental related capital expenditures continuing operations discontinued operations environmental related capital expenditures include additions and modifications to company facilities to mitigate and or eliminate emissions and waste generation 
most of these capital expenditures are required to comply with federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations 
higher estimated expenditures versus are partially due to environmental expenditures that will be incurred in to prepare properties owned by the company for sale 
higher capital expenditures are also attributed to various planned environmental projects in the company s international subsidiaries related to process improvements and regulatory compliance 
amounts recorded for environmental related expenses were approximately million in  million in and million in environmental expenses include provisions for remediation that were identified during the company s ongoing review of its environmental obligations and operating  maintenance and administrative expenses 
lower expenses in versus were primarily due to lower remediation provisions in higher expenses in versus were due partially to additional remediation provisions recorded in for the cleanup of service station sites  distribution facilities and central california oil and gas fields formerly operated by the company 
higher expenses were also due to additional provisions that were recorded for remediation liabilities related to agricultural chemical sites sold by the company in at december   the company s reserves for environmental remediation obligations totaled million  of which million was included in current liabilities 
during  cash payments of million were applied against the reserves and million in provisions were added to the reserves 
the company may also incur additional liabilities in the future at sites where remediation liabilities are probable but future environmental costs are not presently reasonably estimable because the sites have not been assessed or the assessments have not advanced to stages where costs are reasonably estimable 
at those sites where investigations or feasibility studies have advanced to the stage of analyzing feasible alternative remedies and or ranges of costs  the company estimates that it could incur possible additional remediation costs aggregating approximately million 
the reserve amounts and possible additional costs are grouped into the following four categories at december  millions of dollars reserve possible additional costs superfund and similar sites active company facilities company facilities sold with retained liabilities and former company operated sites inactive or closed company facilities total reserve also see notes and to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report for additional information on environmental related matters 
in  provisions of million were recorded for the superfund and similar sites category 
the provisions were primarily for the company s estimated remaining share of oversight and monitoring costs related to the mccoll superfund site in fullerton  california as the result of a federal appeals court overturning a lower court decision that held the federal government responsible for cleanup of the site because of its role in encouraging oil companies to produce gasoline during world war ii 
payments for this category of sites were million in provisions of million were recorded for sites included in the company s active company facilities category 
these provisions were primarily for the estimated cost of studies  investigations and remediation activities at molycorp s molybdenum mine located in questa  new mexico 
molycorp has been working cooperatively with the state of new mexico and the us environmental protection agency to determine if past mining operations have had an adverse ecological impact on surface water and groundwater  and to identify remedial alternatives to mitigate any impact identified 
through this collaborative effort  it was determined that the scope of the environmental studies and investigations for the site needed to be expanded 
the company made payments of million for this category of sites in during  provisions of million were recorded for the company facilities sold with retained liabilities and former company operated sites category 
the provisions included revised remediation cost estimates that the company received from the purchaser of service stations  bulk plants  terminals  refineries and pipelines that were part of the company s former west coast refining  marketing and transportation assets sold in provisions for this category were also recorded as a result of revised cost estimates related to the cleanup of the company s former service stations and distribution facilities throughout the us and the estimated additional cost to clean up contaminated areas that had been identified at a former oil field in michigan that was previously operated by the company 
cash payments of million were made in for sites in this category 
provisions of million were recorded in for sites included in the inactive or closed company facilities category 
these provisions were principally for the cost of remediation work related to the decommissioning and decontamination of molycorp s closed molybdenum and rare earth processing facilities in washington and york  pennsylvania 
as a result of ongoing cooperative efforts between the company and the nuclear regulatory commission  it was determined that additional volumes of low level radioactive contaminated material  in excess of amounts previously estimated  needed to be removed at the york and washington sites 
provisions were also recorded for revised cost estimates related to various remediation projects at the company s former guadalupe oil field on the central california coast 
during  million in payments were made for this category 
the possible additional remediation costs of million estimated at december   were million lower than at year end the net decrease for the year included lower estimated possible additional costs of million for superfund and similar sites 
estimated oversight and monitoring costs for the mccoll site previously included in the possible costs for this category were added to the reserve in as discussed above 
estimated possible additional costs for the active company facilities category of sites decreased by million in the decrease was the result of adding estimated costs to the reserve and revising cost estimates in this category for various sites  including the company s oil and gas sites in alaska and molycorp s questa  new mexico  molybdenum mine 
partially offsetting the foregoing decreases in was a million increase in estimated possible costs for the company facilities sold with retained liabilities and former company operated sites category 
the company increased its estimate for possible additional costs for areas within the former company operated michigan oilfield that have not yet been investigated 
higher possible costs were also estimated for company s former west coast refining  marketing and transportation assets sold in  a portion of these estimated costs were subsequently added to the reserve for these sites as discussed above 
the higher costs were based on estimates provided by the purchaser of these sites 
partially offsetting the above increases for this category of sites were lower cost estimates for service stations and distribution facilities located throughout the us that were formerly operated by the company 
possible additional costs for the inactive or closed company facilities category of sites increased by million 
the increase included the higher estimated possible decommissioning and decontamination costs related to the additional volumes of radioactive contaminated material  in excess of amounts previously estimated that may be present at the washington  pennsylvania site 
a portion of these estimated possible additional costs for this site were subsequently added to the reserve during as discussed above 
the company also estimated possible additional costs for a closed tank farm in san luis obispo  california 
the estimate is based on the upper end of the range of costs for possible cleanup and restoration scenarios evaluated by the company during the year for the final disposition of the site that could occur but are not yet required 
outlook volatile energy prices are expected to continue to impact financial results 
the company expects energy prices to remain volatile due to changes in climate conditions  worldwide demand  crude oil and natural gas inventory levels  production quotas set by opec  current and future worldwide political instability  especially events concerning iraq and venezuela  and security and other factors

the company previously used the units of production method to accrue these costs 
sfas no 
resulted in higher costs being accrued early in the fields lives when production was at its highest levels and abandonment and restoration costs accruals were matched with the revenues as oil and gas were produced 
under sfas no 
 when the liabilities for asset retirement obligations are initially recorded at fair values  capital costs of the related assets will be increased by equal corresponding amounts 
over time  changes in the present value of the liabilities will be accreted and expensed and the capitalized asset costs will be depreciated over the useful lives of the corresponding assets 
because sfas no 
requires the use of interest accretion for revaluing asset retirement obligation liabilities as a result of the passage of time  associated accretion costs will be higher near the end of the fields lives when oil and gas production and related revenues are at their lowest levels 
accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting changes requires that the company calculate the retroactive impact of adopting sfas no 
from the inception of its asset retirement obligations to its january  adoption date 
apb no 
requires that this impact be quantified and reported as a cumulative effect of an accounting change on the earnings statement 
this cumulative effect will include the catch up of sfas no 
accretion expense related to the fair value of the liabilities as well as the catch up of associated depreciation expense related to the increased capital costs of the corresponding assets 
the cumulative effect will also include the reversal of abandonment and restoration costs previously charged to earnings under sfas no 
in addition to the impact on earnings due to the differences in applying sfas no 
and sfas no 
to the company s oil and gas operations  the cumulative effect will also include the impact related to the company s mining operations under sfas no 
the company expects to finalize its abandonment plans by late march and will record the effects of adopting sfas no 
as of january  in the first quarter of the company expects to recognize a one time after tax charge in the range of million to million as the cumulative effect of an accounting change related to the adoption of sfas no 
sfas no 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this statement provides guidance on the recognition and measurement of liabilities associated with disposal activities and is effective for the company on january  the company does not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a significant impact on its financial position or results of operations 
sfas no 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of sfas no 
the statement provides for three methods of transitioning from the intrinsic value to the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation 
this statement also amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
and apb opinion no 
 interim financial reporting  to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the disclosure requirements of the statement are effective for the company immediately and are reflected in this report see note to the consolidated financial statements in item 
the company expects to adopt the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
 on a prospective basis  effective january  this change is estimated to decrease after tax net income by approximately million 
when fully phased in for future grants over the next three years  the annual expense is estimated to be approximately million after tax 
fasb interpretation no 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
this interpretation requires the recognition of certain guarantees as liabilities at fair market value and is effective for guarantees issued or modified after december  the company has included the disclosure requirements of the interpretation in this report see note to the consolidated financial statements in item and does not expect that the adoption will have a significant impact on its financial position or results of operations 
fasb interpretation no 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
this interpretation requires the consolidation of certain companies that are defined as variable interest entities 
this interpretation is effective for new variable interest entities as of february  the effective date for entities existing prior to february  is july  the company has included the disclosure requirements of the interpretation in this report and expects the adoption of the recognition ie  consolidation requirements of the interpretation to increase its consolidated long term debt by approximately million 
this amount that the company anticipates to consolidate when it adopts the interpretation includes million related to a partnership interest in which it has a minority interest liability see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report and million of third party debt of dspl see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
other proposed accounting changes considered from time to time by the fasb  the us sec and the united states congress could materially impact the company s reported financial position and results of operations 
risk factors our business activities and our securities are subject to significant hazards and risks  including those described below 
if any of such events should occur  our business  financial condition  liquidity and or results of operations could be materially harmed  and holders and purchasers of our securities could lose part or all of their investments 
additional risks relating to our securities may be included in the prospectuses for securities we issue in the future 
our profitability is highly dependent on the prices of crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids  which have historically been very volatile 
our revenues  profitability  operating cash flows and future rate of growth are highly dependent on the prices of crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids  which are affected by numerous factors beyond our control 
historically these prices have been very volatile 
for example  our us lower gas prices declined significantly in and from the very high levels reached in the second half of and early recently  these prices have increased again substantially 
a significant downward trend in commodity prices would have a material adverse effect on our revenues  profitability and cash flow and could result in a reduction in the carrying value of our oil and gas properties and the amounts of our proved oil and gas reserves 
our commodity hedging and speculating activities may prevent us from benefiting fully from price increases and may expose us to other risks 
to the extent that we engage in hedging activities to endeavor to protect ourselves from commodity price volatility  we may be prevented from realizing the benefits of price increases above the levels of the hedges 
in addition  we engage in limited speculative trading in hydrocarbon commodities and derivative instruments in connection with our risk management activities  which subjects us to additional risk 
our drilling activities may not be productive 
drilling for oil and gas involves numerous risks  including the risk that we will not encounter commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs 
the costs of drilling  completing and operating wells are often uncertain  and drilling operations may be curtailed  delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors  including unexpected drilling conditions  pressure or irregularities in formations  equipment failures or accidents  fires  explosions  blow outs and surface cratering  marine risks such as capsizing  collisions and hurricanes  other adverse weather conditions  and shortages or delays in the delivery of equipment 
certain of our future drilling activities may not be successful and  if unsuccessful  this failure could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition 
while all drilling  whether developmental or exploratory  involves these risks  exploratory drilling involves greater risks of dry holes or failure to find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons 
because of the percentage of our capital budget devoted to higher risk exploratory projects  it is likely that we will continue to experience significant exploration and dry hole expenses 
as part of our strategy  we explore for oil and gas offshore  often in deep water or at deep drilling depths  where operations are more difficult and costly than on land or than at shallower depths and in shallower waters 
deepwater operations generally require a significant amount of time between a discovery and the time that we can produce and market the oil or gas  increasing both the operational and financial risks associated with these activities 
we may not be insured against all of the operating risks to which our business is exposed 
our business is subject to all of the operating risks normally associated with the exploration for and production of oil and gas  including blowouts  leaks  spills  cratering and fire  as well as weather related risks  such as severe storms and hurricanes  any of which could result in damage to  or destruction of  oil and gas wells or formations or production facilities and other property  some of which may be difficult and expensive to control and or remediate  as well as injuries and or deaths 
in addition  our pipeline  midstream and mining activities are subject to similar risks 
as protection against financial loss resulting from these operating hazards  we maintain insurance coverages  including certain physical damage  comprehensive general liability and worker s compensation insurance 
however  because of deductibles and other limitations  we are not fully insured against all risks in our business 
the occurrence of a significant event against which we are not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and possibly on our financial position 
material differences between the estimated and actual timing of critical events may affect the completion of and commencement of production from development projects 
we are involved in several large development projects  principally offshore 
key factors that may affect the timing and outcome of those projects include project approvals by joint venture partners  timely issuance of permits and licenses by governmental agencies  manufacturing and delivery schedules of critical equipment  such as offshore platforms  and commercial arrangements for pipelines and related equipment to transport and market hydrocarbons 
delays and differences between estimated and actual timing of critical events may adversely affect the completion of and commencement of production from such projects and  consequently  the economic value of and returns on such projects 
our oil and gas reserve data and future net revenue estimates are uncertain 
estimates of reserves by necessity are projections based on engineering data  future rates of production and the amounts and timing of future expenditures 
we base the estimates of our proved oil and gas reserves and projected future net revenues on reserve reports we prepare 
the process of estimating oil and gas reserves requires substantial judgment on the part of the petroleum engineers  resulting in imprecise determinations  particularly with respect to new discoveries 
different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserve quantities and revenues attributable to those reserves based on the same data 
future performance that deviates significantly from reserve reports could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects  as well as on the amounts and carrying values of such reserves 
fluctuations in the prices of oil and natural gas can have the effect of significantly altering reserve estimates  because the economic projections inherent in the estimates and the terms of production sharing contracts for our foreign operations may reduce or increase the quantities of recoverable reserves 
under our production sharing contracts  under which we receive shares of production to recover our costs  our entitlement share of reserves and production generally decrease as sales prices increase  and vice versa 
we may not realize the prices our reserve estimates reflect or produce the estimated volumes during the periods those estimates reflect 
actual future production  oil and natural gas prices  revenues  taxes  development expenditures  operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves most likely will vary from our estimates 
any downward revision in our estimated quantities of reserves or of the carrying values of our reserves could have adverse consequences on our financial results  such as increased depreciation  depletion and amortization charges and or impairment charges  which would reduce earnings and stockholders equity 
if we fail to find or acquire additional reserves  our reserves and production will decline materially from their current levels 
the rate of production from oil and gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted 
except to the extent we conduct successful exploration and development activities or  through engineering studies  identify additional productive zones or secondary recovery reserves  or acquire additional properties containing proved reserves  our proved reserves will decline materially as oil and gas are produced 
future oil and gas production is  therefore  highly dependent on our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves 
our growth may depend on our ability to acquire oil and gas properties on a profitable basis 
acquisitions of producing oil and gas properties have been a key element of maintaining and growing our reserves and production in recent years  particularly in north america 
the success of any acquisition will depend on a number of factors  including the ability to estimate accurately the recoverable volumes of reserves  rates of future production and future net revenues attainable from reserves and to assess future abandonment and possible future environmental liabilities 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and actual future production rates and associated costs and potential liabilities with respect to prospective acquisition targets 
actual results may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates 
we are subject to domestic governmental risks that may impact our operations 
our domestic operations have been  and at times in the future may be  affected by political developments and by federal  state and local laws and regulations such as restrictions on production  changes in taxes  royalties and other amounts payable to governments or governmental agencies  price controls and environmental protection laws and regulations 
global political and economic developments may impact our operations 
political and economic factors in international markets may have a material adverse effect on our operations 
on an equivalent barrel basis  over one half of our oil and gas production in was outside the united states  and approximately two thirds of our proved oil and gas reserves at december  were located outside of the united states 
all of our geothermal operations and reserves are located outside the united states 
there are many risks associated with operations in international markets  including changes in foreign governmental policies relating to crude oil  natural gas liquids  natural gas and geothermal steam pricing and taxation  other political  economic or diplomatic developments  changing political conditions and international monetary fluctuations 
these risks include political and economic instability or war  the possibility that a foreign government may seize our property with or without compensation  confiscatory taxation  legal proceedings and claims arising from our foreign investments or operations  a foreign government attempting to renegotiate or revoke existing contractual arrangements  fluctuating currency values and currency controls  and constrained natural gas markets dependent on demand in a single or limited geographical area 
actions of the united states government through tax and other legislation  executive order and commercial restrictions can adversely affect our operating profitability overseas  as well as in the us various agencies of the united states and other governments have from time to time imposed restrictions which have limited our ability to gain attractive opportunities or even operate in various countries 
these restrictions have in the past limited our foreign opportunities and may continue to do so in the future 
the oil and gas exploration and production industry is very competitive  and many of our exploration and production competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do 
strong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas exploration and production industry and  in particular  in the exploration and development of new reserves 
we compete with major integrated and other independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of oil and gas leases and other properties  for the equipment and labor required to explore  develop and operate those properties and in the marketing of oil and natural gas production 
many of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than those available to us 
as a consequence  we may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for drilling rights 
in addition  many of our larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect the demand for oil and natural gas production  such as changes in worldwide prices and levels of production  the cost and availability of alternative fuels and the application of government regulations 
we also compete in attracting and retaining personnel  including geologists  geophysicists  engineers and other specialists 
environmental compliance and remediation have resulted in and could continue to result in increased operating costs and capital requirements 
our operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment 
we have incurred  and will continue to incur  substantial operating  maintenance  remediation and capital expenditures as a result of these laws and regulations 
our compliance with amended  new or more stringent requirements  stricter interpretations of existing requirements or the future discovery of contamination may require us to make material expenditures or subject us to liabilities beyond what we currently anticipate 
in addition  any failure by us to comply with existing or future laws could result in civil or criminal fines and other enforcement action against us 
our past and present operations and those of companies we have acquired expose us to civil claims by third parties for alleged liability resulting from contamination of the environment or personal injuries caused by releases of hazardous substances 
for example we are investigating or remediating contamination at a large number of formerly and currently owned or operated sites and have recently recorded additional liabilities relating to some of these sites  and we have been identified as a potentially responsible party at several superfund and other multi party sites where we or our predecessors are alleged to have disposed of wastes in the past 
environmental laws are subject to frequent change and many of those laws have become more stringent 
in some cases  they can impose liability for the entire cost of cleanup on any responsible party without regard to negligence or fault and impose liability on us for the conduct of others or conditions others have caused  or for our acts that complied with all applicable requirements when we performed them 
it is not possible for us to estimate reliably the amount and timing of all future expenditures related to environmental and legal matters and other contingencies because some potentially contaminated sites are in the early stages of investigation  and other sites may be identified in the future  cleanup requirements are difficult to predict at sites where remedial investigations have not been completed or final decisions have not been made regarding cleanup requirements  technologies or other factors that bear on cleanup costs  environmental laws frequently impose joint and several liability on all potentially responsible parties  and it can be difficult to determine the number and financial condition of other potentially responsible parties and their shares of responsibility for cleanup costs  environmental laws and regulations are continually changing  and court proceedings are inherently uncertain  and some legal matters are in the early stages of investigation or proceeding or their outcomes otherwise may be difficult to predict  and other legal matters may be identified in the future 
although our management believes that it has established appropriate reserves for cleanup costs  due to these uncertainties  we could be required to provide significant additional reserves in the future  which could adversely affect our results of operations and possibly our financial position 
more detailed information with respect to the matters discussed above is set forth under the caption environmental regulation  under the environmental matters section of the management s discussion and analysis  and in note to the consolidated financial statements in item we are subject to lawsuits and claims involving substantial amounts and sometimes asserting novel theories of recovery 
we have a number of lawsuits and claims pending against us as a consequence of the past conduct of our business  some of which seek large amounts of damages 
while we currently believe that none of them will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity  certain of them could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the accounting period or periods in which one or more of them might be resolved adversely 
in addition  certain of the pending matters are seeking to take advantage of expansive judicial interpretations of laws and precedents to impose liability for acts that we believed to be in compliance with applicable laws and regulations at the time  and we could be the subject of similar such lawsuits and or claims in the future 
we depend upon payments from our subsidiaries 
we conduct substantially all of our operations through union oil and other domestic and international subsidiaries 
our principal sources of cash are dividends and advances from our subsidiaries  investments  including certain equity investments in other operating companies  payments by subsidiaries for services rendered and interest payments from subsidiaries on cash advances 
the amount of cash and income available to us from our subsidiaries largely depends upon each subsidiary s earnings and operating and capital requirements 
in addition  the ability of our subsidiaries to make any payments or transfer funds will depend on the subsidiaries earnings  business and tax considerations and legal restrictions 
failure to receive adequate cash and income from our subsidiaries could jeopardize our ability to make payments on debt securities we issue  including those held by unocal capital trust or that we may issue in the future to unocal capital trust ii  to satisfy our guarantees of debt securities of union oil and the trust preferred securities of unocal capital trust or that unocal capital trust ii may issue  and to pay dividends on our common stock and any preferred stock we may issue 
our debt level may limit our financial flexibility 
as of december   our consolidated balance sheet showed billion of total debt outstanding 
in addition  unocal capital trust  a consolidated finance subsidiary  has million of convertible trust preferred securities outstanding  which represent beneficial interests in a like amount of subordinated debt we issued to it 
effective in the third quarter of  pursuant to a recently issued accounting requirement  we will be recording as an additional million of debt amounts that  at december   had either been classified as a minority interest on the balance sheet or omitted from the balance sheet as the debt of an unconsolidated equity investee 
we may incur additional debt in the future  including in connection with acquisitions  recapitalizations and refinancings 
the level of our debt could have several important effects on our future operations  including  among others a significant portion of our cash flow from operations will be applied to the payment of principal and interest on the debt and will not be available for other purposes  credit rating agencies have changed  and may continue to change  their ratings of our debt and other obligations as a result of changes in our debt level  financial condition  earnings and cash flow  which in turn impacts the costs  terms and conditions and availability of financing  covenants contained in our existing and future debt arrangements will require us to meet financial tests that may affect our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business  including possible acquisition opportunities  our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  general corporate and other purposes may be limited or burdened by increased costs or more restrictive covenants  we may be at a competitive disadvantage to similar companies that have less debt  and our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions may increase 
we have substantial financial obligations and commitments  which are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheet 
in the normal course of business we and our subsidiaries had incurred  at december   substantial contractual obligations for  non cancelable operating leases million  including drill ship leases  reimbursement obligations under standby letters of credit million and performance bonds million posted by third party financial institutions on our behalf  and other financial assurances that we and or our subsidiaries have given to satisfy the requirements of federal  state  local and foreign governmental entities and other parties million 
furthermore  at year end  we had firmly commited to approximately million in capital expenditures in for the development of offshore oil and gas fields  including related platforms  pipelines and other infrastructures  in the gulf of mexico  indonesia and azerbaijan 
we hope to finance a portion of these projects through governmental and multilateral agencies 
while we expect  based on current commodity prices  to be able to satisfy these obligations  to the extent they become due in  with cash on hand and expected to be generated from operating activities and asset sales  declines in commodity prices from current levels could require us to sell additional assets  incur significant additional debt or issue other securities to obtain the necessary funds 
a change of control of us could result in the acceleration of our outstanding bank borrowings and trigger various change of control provisions included in employee and director plans and agreements 
two bank credit facilities guaranteed by us  under which union oil can borrow an aggregate of up to billion  provide for the termination of their loan commitments and require the prepayment of all outstanding borrowings under the facilities in the event that any person or group becomes the beneficial owner of more than percent of our then outstanding voting stock other than in a transaction having the approval of our board of directors  at least a majority of which are continuing directors  or our continuing directors cease to constitute at least a majority of the board 
if this situation were to occur  we and union oil would likely be required to refinance the outstanding indebtedness under these credit facilities 
there can be no assurance that we would be able to refinance this indebtedness or  if a refinancing were to occur  that the refinancing would be on terms favorable to us 
under various employee and director plans and agreements  in the event of a change in control  restricted stock would become unrestricted  unvested options and phantom units would vest  performance shares  performance bonus awards and incentive compensation would be paid out  and directors units would be paid out if the director has so elected 
we are also party to employment agreements and other agreements with certain of our employees containing change of control provisions 
we have adopted an enhanced severance program for approximately  us payroll employees not represented by collective bargaining agreements and a limited number of international employees in the event they lose their jobs through a change of control 
we may issue preferred stock  the terms of which could adversely affect the voting power or value of our common stock 
our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue  without the approval of our stockholders  one or more series of preferred stock having such preferences  powers and relative  participating  optional and other rights  including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions  as the board of directors generally may determine 
the terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could adversely impact the voting power and or value of our common stock 
for example  we could grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions 
similarly  the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we might assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock 
provisions in our corporate documents and delaware law could delay or prevent a change of control of us  even if that change would be beneficial to our stockholders 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make a change of control of us difficult  even if it would be beneficial to our stockholders  including provisions governing the classification  nomination and removal of directors  a provision prohibiting stockholder action by written consent  a provision that allows only our board of directors to call a special meeting of stockholders  provisions regulating the ability of our stockholders to bring matters for action before annual stockholder meetings  and the authorization given to our board of directors to issue and set the terms of preferred stock 
in addition  we have adopted a stockholder rights plan  which would cause extreme dilution to any person or group that attempts to acquire a significant interest in unocal without advance approval of our board of directors  while section of the delaware general corporation law would impose restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between unocal and any holder of percent or more of our outstanding common stock 
we may reduce or cease to pay dividends on our common stock 
we can provide no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends at the current rate or at all 
the amount of cash dividends  if any  to be paid in the future will depend upon their declaration by our board of directors and upon our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow  the levels of our capital and exploration expenditures  our future business prospects and other related matters that our board of directors deems relevant 
in addition  under the terms of the outstanding trust preferred securities of unocal capital trust and the unocal subordinated debt securities held by that trust  we have the right  under certain circumstances to suspend the payment to that trust of interest on the subordinated debt securities  in which event the trust has the right to suspend the payment of distributions on its trust preferred securities 
in this situation  we would be prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock 
cautionary statement for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of this report discusses our plans  strategies and expectations for our business and contains other forward looking statements  as this term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of  as embodied in section a of the securities act  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act  as amended

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk generally represents the risk that losses may occur in the values of financial instruments as a result of changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
as part of its overall risk management strategies  the company uses derivative financial instruments to manage and reduce risks associated with these factors 
the company also trades hydrocarbon derivative instruments  such as futures contracts  swaps and options to exploit anticipated opportunities arising from commodity price fluctuations 
the company determines the fair values of its derivative financial instruments primarily based upon market quotes of exchange traded instruments 
most futures and options contracts are valued based upon direct exchange quotes or industry published price indices 
some instruments with longer maturity periods require financial modeling to accommodate calculations beyond the horizons of available exchange quotes 
these models calculate values for outer periods using current exchange quotes ie  forward curve and assumptions regarding interest rates  commodity and interest rate volatility and  in some cases  foreign currency exchange rates 
while the company feels that current exchange quotes and assumptions regarding interest rates and volatilities are appropriate factors to measure the fair value of its longer termed derivative instruments  other pricing assumptions or methodologies may lead to materially different results in some instances 
interest rate risk from time to time the company temporarily invests its excess cash in short term interest bearing securities issued by high quality issuers 
company policies limit the amount of investment in securities of any one financial institution 
due to the short time the investments are outstanding and their general liquidity  these instruments are classified as cash equivalents in the consolidated balance sheet and do not represent a material interest rate risk to the company 
the company s primary market risk exposure to changes in interest rates relates to the company s long term debt obligations 
the company manages its exposure to changing interest rates principally through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt 
interest rate risk sensitive derivative financial instruments  such as swaps or options may also be used depending upon market conditions 
the company evaluated the potential effect that near term changes in interest rates would have had on the fair value of its interest rate risk sensitive financial instruments at december  assuming a ten percent decrease in the company s weighted average borrowing costs at december  and  respectively  the potential increase in the fair value of the company s debt obligations and associated interest rate derivative instruments  including the debt obligations and associated interest rate derivative instruments of its subsidiaries  would have been approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
foreign exchange rate risk the company conducts business in various parts of the world and in various foreign currencies 
to limit the company s foreign currency exchange rate risk related to operating income  foreign sales agreements generally contain price provisions designed to insulate the company s sales revenues against adverse foreign currency exchange rates 
in most countries  energy products are valued and sold in us dollars and foreign currency operating cost exposures have not been significant 
in other countries  the company is paid for product deliveries in local currencies but at prices indexed to the us dollar 
these funds  less amounts retained for operating costs  are converted to us dollars as soon as practicable 
the company s canadian subsidiaries are paid in canadian dollars for their crude oil and natural gas sales 
from time to time the company may purchase foreign currency options or enter into foreign currency swap or foreign currency forward contracts to limit the exposure related to its foreign currency debt or other obligations 
at december   the company had various foreign currency swaps and foreign currency forward contracts outstanding related to operations in canada  thailand and the netherlands 
the company evaluated the effect that near term changes in foreign exchange rates would have had on the fair value of the company s combined foreign currency position related to its outstanding foreign currency swaps and forward contracts
