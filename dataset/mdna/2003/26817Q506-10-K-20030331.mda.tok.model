item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the company is a financial services company  which invests in loans and securities consisting of or secured by  principally single family mortgage loans  commercial mortgage loans  manufactured housing installment loans and delinquent property tax receivables 
the loans and securities in which the company invests have generally been pooled and pledged ie securitized as collateral for non recourse bonds collateralized bonds  which provides long term financing for such loans while limiting credit  interest rate and liquidity risk 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based in large part upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of the financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgements or uncertainties  and which may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions  or the application of which may have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
the following are the company s critical accounting policies  summarized from footnote to the consolidated financial statements 
fair value 
the company uses estimates in establishing fair value for its financial instruments 
estimates of fair value for financial instruments may be based on market prices provided by certain dealers 
estimates of fair value for certain other financial instruments are determined by calculating the present value of the projected cash flows of the instruments using appropriate discount rates  prepayment rates and credit loss assumptions 
collateral for collateralized bonds make up a significant portion of the company s investments 
the estimate of fair value for securities within collateral for collateralized bonds is determined by calculating the present value of the projected net cash flows of the instruments  using discount rates  prepayment rate assumptions and credit loss assumptions established by management 
the discount rate used in the determination of fair value of the collateral for collateralized bonds was at december  and the company utilizes a discount rate of in determining the fair value of its financial instruments when the company s ownership interest in such financial instrument is generally represented by interests rated bbb or below  and generally concentrated in the overcollateralization or residual interest components 
prepayment rate assumptions at december  and were generally at a constant prepayment rate  or cpr  ranging from for  and for  for collateral for collateralized bonds consisting of securities backed by single family mortgage loans  and a cpr equivalent of for and for  for collateral for collateralized bonds consisting of securities backed by manufactured housing loans cpr assumptions for each year are based in part on the actual prepayment rates experienced for the prior six month period and in part on management s estimate of future prepayment activity 
the loss assumptions utilized vary for each series of collateral for collateralized bonds  depending on the collateral pledged 
the cash flows for the collateral for collateralized bonds were projected to the estimated date that the collateralized bond security could be called and retired by the company if there is economic value to the company in calling and retiring the collateralized bond security 
such call date is typically triggered on the earlier of a specified date or when the remaining collateralized bond security balance equals of the original balance the call date 
the company estimates anticipated market prices of the underlying collateral at the call date 
the company estimated the fair value of certain other investments as the present value of expected future cash flows  less costs to service such investments  discounted at a rate of 
the company utilizes a discount rate of in determining fair value of its financial instruments when the company s ownership interest in such financial instrument includes a combination of investment grade and non investment grade classes  on an actual rating or an implied rating basis 
allowance for losses 
the company has credit risk on loans pledged as collateral for collateralized bonds in its investment portfolio 
an allowance for losses has been estimated and established for current expected losses based on certain performance factors associated with the collateral  including current loan delinquencies  historical cure rates of delinquent loans  and historical and anticipated loss severity of the loans as they are liquidated 
the allowance for losses is evaluated and adjusted periodically by management based on the actual and projected timing and amount of probable credit losses  using the above factors  as well as industry loss experience 
where loans are considered homogeneous  the allowance for losses are established and evaluated on a pool basis 
otherwise  the allowance for losses is established and evaluated on a loan specific basis 
provisions made to increase the allowance related to credit risk are presented as provision for losses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the company s actual credit losses may differ from those estimates used to establish the allowance 
financial condition below is a discussion of the company s financial condition

collateral for collateralized bonds in also included delinquent property tax receivables 
as of december   the company had series of collateralized bonds outstanding 
the collateral for collateralized bonds decreased to billion at december  compared to billion at december  this decrease of million is primarily the result of million in paydowns on the collateral  million of increased provisions for losses on collateral  million of impairment losses on securities  amortization of premiums and discounts of million and market value adjustments of million offset by the addition of million of new collateral 
other investments other investments at december  and consist primarily of delinquent property tax receivables and subsequent real estate owned 
other investments decreased to million at december  compared to million at december  this decrease of million resulted from payments of million received on delinquent property tax receivables  million in sales of related real estate owned and million of write downs of tax certificates and real estate owned 
these decreases were partially offset by million amortization of unrealized losses and million of additional costs incurred in the collection of the tax receivables 
securities securities decreased to million at december   compared to million at december   primarily as a result of principal payments of million during the year  the call of the underlying pass through security resulting in the repayment and write off of these classes and the transfer of million of derivative securities to sasco and declines in fair value of million 
these decreases were partially offset by the purchase of two inverse floating securities  a fixed rate security and the call of a collateralized bond structure amounting to million which was subsequently reclassified to securities 
loans loans increased to million at december  from million at december  in connection with the securitization completed in april as previously discussed  non performing loans in the amount of million were reclassified to loans from collateral for collateralized bonds 
this increase was partially offset by paydowns on the loans of million  impairment write downs of million  and million of other net decreases 
non recourse debt collateralized bonds issued by the company are recourse only to the assets pledged as collateral  and are otherwise non recourse to the company 
collateralized bonds decreased to billion at december  from billion at december  this decrease was primarily a result of principal pay downs of million and interest made during the year  from the principal payments received from the associated collateral for collateralized bonds and a net decrease of million for accrued interest payable 
these decreases were partially offset by a net increase in bonds payable of million and amortization of million of discount on the collateralized bonds 
recourse debt during  the company repaid all of the company s million of outstanding senior notes and a million capital lease 
shareholders equity shareholders equity decreased from million at december  to million at december  this decrease resulted from the net loss for the year of million  a million increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss  and a payment of million of preferred stock dividends 
the increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss resulted principally from the decline in the fair value of debt securities of million  and mark to market losses of million on interest rate swap and synthetic interest rate swap contracts 
these increases in accumulated other comprehensive loss were offset by the amortization of million of accumulated other comprehensive loss recorded in as an adjustment to the carrying value of certain debt securities reclassified from available for sale to held to maturity in accordance with sfas no

net interest margin before provision for losses for the year ended december  decreased to million  from million for the same period in the decrease in net interest margin before provision for losses of million  or  was the result of the decline in interest earning assets  partially offset by an increase in the net interest spread on interest earning assets 
the company provides for losses on its loans where it has retained credit risk 
provision for losses for loans increased to million in  from million in the increase in provision for losses of million is primarily a result of additions for manufactured housing loans 
the continuing under performance of these loans prompted the company to revise its estimate of losses to include a percentage of all loans with delinquencies greater than days 
this revision  which was instituted during the fourth quarter of  resulted in an increase in provision for losses of million during the quarter 
loss severity on the manufactured housing loans continued to remain high during as a result of the saturation in the market place with both new and used repossessed manufactured housing units 
defaults in on manufactured housing loans averaged  versus in  and loss severity continued at during the year 
loss severity is the cumulative loss incurred on a loan  or sub set of loans  divided by the unpaid principal balance of such loan s 
while the company has provided for reserves for losses based on current delinquencies and loss severities  should these performance trends continue for a protracted period  or decline further  the company may need to increase the provision for losses on loans in future periods above amounts recorded during net loss on sales  impairment charges  and litigation decreased from an aggregate net loss of million in to an aggregate net loss of million in virtually all of the million net loss in was related to impairment charges 
such impairment charges included other than temporary impairment of debt securities pledged as collateral for collateralized bonds of million for the impairment charges related to debt securities backed by manufactured housing loans  which have experienced high default rates and loss severeties as previously discussed 
in addition  the company incurred impairment charges in related to a million adjustment to the lower of cost or market for certain delinquent single family mortgage loans 
such loans were included in securities called by the company  the balances of which were included in the sasco series securitization completed in april during  the company incurred other than temporary impairments of debt securities pledged as collateral for collateralized bonds of million  and recorded additional impairment charges of million related to delinquent property tax receivables and million for property tax receivables that have been foreclosed and represent real estate owned 
in june  the company entered into a million notional short position on year treasury notes futures contracts expiring in september the company entered into this position to  in effect  mitigate its exposure to rising interest rates on a like amount of floating rate liabilities 
these instruments fail to meet the hedge criteria of sfas no 
 and therefore are accounted for on a trading basis 
in august  the company terminated these contracts at a loss of million 
the company purchased and extinguished million of its july senior notes at a net discount of during  resulting in an extraordinary gain of million in the first quarter of compared to the decrease in net loss during as compared to is primarily the result of an increase in net interest margin  a decrease in net loss on sales  write downs  and impairment charges  an increase in gains from extinguishment of debt  partially offset by an increase in trading losses and general and administrative expenses 
the increase in net income per common share during as compared to is primarily the result of the decrease in net loss and a preferred stock benefit in versus preferred stock charges in the prior year 
net interest margin before provision for losses for the year ended december  increased to million  from million for the same period in the increase in net interest margin of million  or  was the result of the reduction in the company s average cost of funds  which declined by approximately  as a result of the overall decline in interest rates during and a reduction in fees related to committed credit facilities 
the company provides for losses on its loans and recognizes other than temporary impairment losses on its debt securities where it has retained credit risk 
provision for losses for loans decreased to million in  from million in and impairment losses for debt securities increased to million in from million in provision for losses and other than temporary impairment losses remained high in due to the under performance of the company s manufactured housing loan portfolio 
loss severity on the manufactured housing loans continued to increase during as a result of the saturation in the market place with both new and used repossessed manufactured housing units 
in addition  the company saw an increase in overall default rates on its manufactured housing loans 
defaults in averaged versus in  and loss severity increased from to during the year 
net loss on sales  write downs and impairment charges decreased from an aggregate net loss of million in to an aggregate net loss of million in net loss on sales  impairment charges and write downs are largely one time items 
during  the company settled various litigation for a net benefit to the company of million 
the company incurred losses in related principally to impairment charges incurred on its delinquent property tax lien portfolio 
the company adjusted the carrying value of such portfolio by million due to other than temporary valuation adjustments as a result of the reclassification of this security from available for sale to held to maturity  and million for adjustments to net realizable value on property tax liens that have been foreclosed and represent real estate owned 
impairment charges also include other than temporary impairment of debt securities pledged as collateral for collateralized bonds as discussed above 
the company also wrote off million of receivables related to the sale of its manufactured housing and model home businesses in during  the company incurred losses related to the phasing out of its commercial production operations  including the sales of substantially all of the company s remaining commercial and multifamily loan positions 
in addition  the company recorded a loss of million as a result of the expiration of a company owned option to purchase million of tax exempt bonds secured by multifamily mortgage loans that expired in june the company did not exercise this option  as it did not have the ability to finance this purchase  and the counter party to the agreement retained million in cash collateral as settlement as provided for in the related agreements 
the company recorded a charge against earnings of million in as a result 
in  the company entered into three separate short positions aggregating billion on the june  september  and december ninety day eurodollar futures contracts 
in addition  the company entered into two short positions on the one month libor futures contract 
the company entered into these positions to  in effect  lock in its borrowing costs on a forward basis relative to its floating rate liabilities 
these instruments failed to meet the hedge criteria of sfas no 
 and were accounted for on a trading basis 
accordingly  any gains or losses recognized on these contracts were included in current period results 
during  given the continued decline in one month libor due to reductions in the targeted federal funds rate  the company recognized million in losses related to these contracts 
the company purchased and extinguished million of its july senior notes at a net discount of during  resulting in an extraordinary gain of million 
in june  the company settled litigation for a cash payment of million 
the company had been purchasing debt securities from a special purpose entity referred to as an spe backed by automobile loans 
the company had been carrying these debt securities at estimated fair value 
as a result of this settlement in june  the company received of the outstanding stock of the spe which issued the debt securities  and which owned all of the underlying automobile installment contracts 
as such  in june the company began consolidating the spe on its books as opposed to previously recording its investment in the debt securities 
the company recorded an impairment charge in june to reflect the initial valuation of the underlying automobile installment contracts at their current fair market value 
at the time of the settlement  the company was able to access more information as to the underlying loans than it previously had when it owned only the debt securities 
the company had accrued a reserve as of december   for million related to the litigation  and reversed million of this reserve in as a result of the settlement 
in june  the company recorded permanent impairment charges of million on as a result of the valuation of the underlying automobile contracts 
during the fourth quarter  the company completed the sale of substantially all of the remaining outstanding securities and loans related to this spe 
also during  the company recorded impairment charges and loss on sales of securities aggregating million  relating to the write down of basis and then the sale of million of securities

is not expected to have a material effect on the company s results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
liquidity and capital resources the company has historically financed its operations from a variety of sources 
these sources have included cash flow generated from the investment portfolio  including net interest income and principal payments and prepayments 
in addition  while the company was operating actively originating loans for its investment portfolio  the company funded these operations through short term warehouse lines of credit with commercial and investment banks  repurchase agreements and the capital markets via the asset backed securities market which provides long term non recourse funding of the investment portfolio via the issuance of collateralized bonds 
since  the company has focused on substantially reducing its recourse debt and minimizing its capital requirements 
effective july   with the repayment in full of its july senior notes  the company has repaid all remaining outstanding recourse debt 
furthermore  the company s investment portfolio continues to provide positive cash flow  which can be utilized by the company for reinvestment or other purposes 
should the company s future operations require access to sources of capital such as lines of credit and repurchase agreements  the company believes that it would be able to access such sources 
the company s cash flow from its investment portfolio for the year and quarter ended december  was approximately million and million  respectively 
such cash flow is after payment of principal and interest on the associated collateralized bonds ie  non recourse debt outstanding 
from the cash flow on its investment portfolio  the company funds its operating overhead costs  including the servicing of its delinquent property tax receivables  and repays any remaining recourse debt 
excluding any cash flow derived from the sale or re securitization of assets  and assuming that short term interest rates remain stable  the company anticipates that the cash flow from its investment portfolio will decline in versus as the investment portfolio continues to pay down 
the company anticipates  however  that it will have sufficient cash flow from its investment portfolio to meet all of its obligations on both a short term and long term basis 
in february  the company completed a partial tender offer for shares of its series a  series b and series c preferred stock 
the company purchased for cash  shares of its series a preferred stock   shares of its series b preferred stock and  shares of its series c preferred stock for a total cash payment of million 
in addition  the company exchanged senior notes totaling million  due february   for an additional  shares of series a preferred stock   shares of series b preferred stock and  shares of series c preferred stock 
the company utilized cash flow generated from its investment portfolio to fund the cash portion of the tender offer 
recourse debt during  the company repaid all of its remaining outstanding recourse debt 
the table below sets forth the recourse debt and recourse debt to equity ratio of the company as of december    and total recourse debt in millions total recourse debt  total recourse december  net of issuance costs debt to equity ratio as a result of the amendment to the indenture governing the senior notes entered into in march and a settlement agreement entered into in october by and between the company and aca financial guaranty corporation aca as a result of an action which aca brought against the company in the united states district court for the southern district of new york the amendment to the indenture and the settlement agreement  collectively the senior note agreements  the company was required to call and re securitize certain of its existing collateralized bond and securities for which it owned the call rights by april   and if such re securitization was not completed  to sell certain other securities 
if the company had failed to close the re securitization by april  and sell certain securities by may   aca had the right  at its option  to cause the sale of certain securities owned by the company pursuant to a durable power of attorney granted to it by the company 
as the company met all such obligations  aca was prevented from acting upon the durable power of attorney 
the durable power of attorney terminated in july in february  in connection with a tender offer on the company s preferred stock  the company issued the february notes in the amount of million 
the february notes bear interest at a rate of  and are payable in quarterly installments until their final maturity of february  non recourse debt the company  through limited purpose finance subsidiaries  has issued non recourse debt in the form of collateralized bonds to fund the majority of its investment portfolio 
the obligations under the collateralized bonds are payable solely from the collateral for collateralized bonds and are otherwise non recourse to the company 
collateral for collateralized bonds is not subject to margin calls 
the maturity of each class of collateralized bonds is directly affected by the rate of principal prepayments on the related collateral 
each series is also subject to redemption according to specific terms of the respective indentures  generally when the remaining balance of the bonds equals or less of the original principal balance of the bonds 
at december   the company had billion of collateralized bonds outstanding

forward looking statements certain written statements in this form k made by the company  that are not historical fact  constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
such forward looking statements may involve factors that could cause the actual results of the company to differ materially from historical results or from any results expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
the company cautions the public not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements  which may be based on assumptions and anticipated events that do not materialize 
the company does not undertake  and the securities litigation reform act specifically relieves the company from  any obligation to update any forward looking statements 
factors that may cause actual results to differ from historical results or from any results expressed or implied by forward looking statements include the following economic conditions 
the company is affected by general economic conditions 
the risk of defaults and credit losses could increase during an economic slowdown or recession 
this could have an adverse effect on the company s financial performance and the performance on the company s securitized loan pools 
capital resources 
cash flows from our portfolio are subject to fluctuation due to changes in interest rates  repayment rates and default rates and related losses 
interest rate fluctuations 
the company s income depends on its ability to earn greater interest on its investments than the interest cost to finance these investments 
interest rates in the markets served by the company generally rise or fall with interest rates as a whole 
a majority of the loans currently pledged as collateral for collateralized bonds by the company are fixed rate 
the company currently finances these fixed rate assets through non recourse debt  approximately million of which is variable rate 
in addition  a significant amount of the investments held by the company is adjustable rate collateral for collateralized bonds 
these investments are financed through non recourse long term collateralized bonds 
the net interest spread for these investments could decrease during a period of rapidly rising short term interest rates  since the investments generally have interest rates which reset on a delayed basis and have periodic interest rate caps  the related borrowing have no delayed resets or such interest rate caps 
defaults 
defaults by borrowers on loans retained by the company may have an adverse impact on the company s financial performance  if actual credit losses differ materially from estimates made by the company 
the allowance for losses is calculated on the basis of historical experience and management s best estimates 
actual default rates or loss severity may differ from the company s estimate as a result of economic conditions 
in particular  the default rate and loss severity on the company s portfolio of manufactured housing loans has been higher than initially estimated 
actual defaults on arm loans may increase during a rising interest rate environment 
the company believes that its reserves are adequate for such risks on loans that were delinquent as of december  third party servicers 
third party servicers service the majority of the company s investment portfolio 
to the extent that these servicers are financially impaired  the performance of the company s investment portfolio may deteriorate  and defaults and credit losses may be greater than estimated 
in addition  third party servicers are generally obligated to advance scheduled principal and interest on a loan if such loan is securitized  and to the extent the third party servicer fails to make this advance  the company may be required to make the advance 
prepayments 
prepayments by borrowers on loans securitized by the company may have an adverse impact on the company s financial performance 
prepayments are expected to increase during a declining interest rate or flat yield curve environment 
the company s exposure to rapid prepayments is primarily i the faster amortization of premium on the investments and  to the extent applicable  amortization of bond discount  and ii the replacement of investments in its portfolio with lower yield securities 
depository institution strategy 
the company intends to continue to explore the formation or acquisition of a depository institution 
however  the pursuit of this strategy is subject to the outcome of the company s investigation 
no business plan has been prepared for such strategy 
therefore  any forward looking statement made is subject to the outcome of a variety of factors that are unknown at this time 
competition 
the financial services industry is a highly competitive market 
increased competition in the market has adversely affected the company  and may continue to do so 
regulatory changes 
the company s businesses as of december  are not subject to any material federal or state regulation or licensing requirements 
however  changes in existing laws and regulations or in the interpretation thereof  or the introduction of new laws and regulations  could adversely affect the company and the performance of the company s securitized loan pools or its ability to collect on its delinquent property tax receivables 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk generally represents the risk of loss that may result from the potential change in the value of a financial instrument due to fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates and in equity and commodity prices 
market risk is inherent to both derivative and non derivative financial instruments  and accordingly  the scope of the company s market risk management extends beyond derivatives to include all market risk sensitive financial instruments 
as a financial services company  net interest margin comprises the primary component of the company s earnings 
additionally  cash flow from the investment portfolio represents the primary component of the company s incoming cash flow 
the company is subject to risk resulting from interest rate fluctuations to the extent that there is a gap between the amount of the company s interest earning assets and the amount of interest bearing liabilities that are prepaid  mature or re price within specified periods 
the company monitors the aggregate cash flow  projected net yield and market value of its investment portfolio under various interest rate and prepayment assumptions 
while certain investments may perform poorly in an increasing or decreasing interest rate environment  other investments may perform well  and others may not be impacted at all 
the company focuses on the sensitivity of its cash flow  and measures such sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
changes in interest rates are defined as instantaneous  parallel  and sustained interest rate movements in basis point increments 
the company estimates its net interest margin cash flow for the next twenty four months assuming interest rates over such time period follow the forward libor curve based on day eurodollar futures contracts as of december  once the base case has been estimated  cash flows are projected for each of the defined interest rate scenarios 
those scenario results are then compared against the base case to determine the estimated change to cash flow 
the following table summarizes the company s net interest margin cash flow sensitivity analysis as of december  this analysis represents management s estimate of the percentage change in net interest margin cash flow given a parallel shift in interest rates  as discussed above 
other investments are excluded from this analysis because they are not interest rate sensitive 
the base case represents the interest rate environment as it existed as of december  at december   one month libor and six month libor were both 
the analysis is heavily dependent upon the assumptions used in the model 
the base case model uses estimates of appropriate prepayment rates and credit loss assumptions 
prepayment rate assumptions used were generally at a constant prepayment rate  or cpr  ranging from  for collateral for collateralized bonds consisting of single family mortgage loans and securities  and a cpr equivalent ranging from for collateral for collateralized bonds consisting of manufactured housing loans and securities collateral 
commercial mortgage loan collateral was generally assumed to repay in accordance with their contractual terms 
the loss assumptions utilized vary for each series of collateral for collateralized bonds  depending on the collateral pledged 
the effect of changes in future interest rates  the shape of the yield curve or the mix of assets and liabilities may cause actual results to differ significantly from the modeled results 
in addition  certain financial instruments provide a degree of optionality 
the most significant option affecting the company s portfolio is the borrowers option to prepay the loans 
the model applies prepayment rate assumptions representing management s estimate of prepayment activity on a projected basis for each collateral pool in the investment portfolio 
the model applies the same prepayment rate assumptions for all five cases indicated below 
the extent to which borrowers utilize the ability to exercise their option may cause actual results to significantly differ from the analysis 
furthermore  the projected results assume no additions or subtractions to the company s portfolio  and no change to the company s liability structure 
historically  there have been significant changes in the company s assets and liabilities  and there are likely to be such changes in the future 
change in net basis point interest margin increase decrease cash flow from in interest rates base case base approximately million of the company s investment portfolio as of december  is comprised of loans or securities that have coupon rates which adjust over time subject to certain periodic and lifetime limitations in conjunction with changes in short term interest rates 
approximately and of the arm loans underlying the company s collateral for collateralized bonds are indexed to and reset based upon the level of six month libor and one year cmt  respectively 
generally  during a period of rising short term interest rates  the company s net interest spread earned on its investment portfolio will decrease 
the decrease of the net interest spread results from i the lag in resets of the arm loans underlying the collateral for collateralized bonds relative to the rate resets on the associated borrowings and ii rate resets on the arm loans which are generally limited to every six months or every twelve months and subject to lifetime caps  while the associated borrowings have no such limitation 
as short term interest rates stabilize and the arm loans reset  the net interest margin may be restored to its former level as the yields on the arm loans adjust to market conditions 
conversely  net interest margin may increase following a fall in short term interest rates 
this increase may be temporary as the yields on the arm loans adjust to the new market conditions after a lag period 
in each case  however  the company expects that the increase or decrease in the net interest spread due to changes in the short term interest rates to be temporary 
the net interest spread may also be increased or decreased by the proceeds or costs of interest rate swap  cap or floor agreements  to the extent that the company has entered into such agreements 
the remaining portion of the company s investment portfolio as of december   approximately billion  is comprised of loans or securities that have coupon rates that are fixed 
the company has substantially limited its interest rate risk on such investments through i the issuance of fixed rate collateralized bonds which approximated billion as of december   and ii equity  which was million 
overall  the company s interest rate risk is related both to the rate of change in short term interest rates  and to the level of short term interest rates 
in addition  the company has entered into an interest rate swap to mitigate its interest rate risk exposure on million in notional value of its variable rate bonds 
the swap agreement has been constructed such that the company will pay interest at a fixed rate of on the notional amount and will receive interest based on one month libor on the same notional amount 
the impact on cash flows from the interest rate swap has been included in the table above for each of the respective interest rate scenarios 
an additional approximate million of floating rate liabilities are being converted to a fixed rate through an amortizing synthetic swap created by the short sale of a string of eurodollar futures contract in october  the synthetic swap has an estimated duration of years 
as of december   the weighted average fixed rate cost of the synthetic swap to the company is
