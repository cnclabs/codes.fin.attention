item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general during  the company accomplished several initiatives directly related to the implementation of the company s strategic plan as well as expanding its national platform in routine testing 
this plan continues to provide growth opportunities for the company by building a leadership position in genomic and other advanced testing technologies primarily through internal development efforts  acquisitions and technology licensing activities 
the company s center for molecular biology and pathology  located in research triangle park  nc is a leader in the development and application of molecular diagnostics and polymerase chain reaction  or pcr  technologies in the areas of diagnostic genetics  oncology and infectious disease 
the company believes that these technologies may represent a significant savings to the healthcare system by increasing the detection of early stage treatable diseases 
the company s national genetics institute in los angeles  ca  develops novel  highly sensitive pcr methods used to test for hepatitis c and other infectious agents and is the only laboratory in the us that is fda approved to screen plasma for infectious diseases 
viro med laboratories  inc  based in minneapolis  mn  offers molecular microbial testing using real time pcr platforms and provides significant additional capacity to support the continued expansion of the company s advanced testing business 
these centers of excellence enable the company to provide a broad menu of testing services for the infectious disease and cancer markets  which the company believes represent two of the most significant areas of future growth in the clinical laboratory industry 
on july   the company completed its acquisition of dynacare  a provider of clinical laboratory testing services in states in the united states and two provinces in canada 
dynacare had revenues of approximately million and had approximately  employees at the closing date of the acquisition 
this acquisition directly supports the company s strategic objectives of strengthening its national presence by expanding the company s geographic reach not only in various regions of the us  but also in canada and allows the company to further enhance service to its clients and their patients by offering more conveniently located patient service centers and on site testing facilities 
it also allows the company to broaden the array of testing services currently available to physicians  particularly in specialized fields such as molecular biology  genetics  oncology and infectious disease 
the company achieved million in synergy savings relating to the integration of dynacare by the end of and expects to realize total savings of million by the end of the company completed the acquisition of dianon on january  dianon had revenues of approximately million and had approximately  employees at the closing date of the acquisition 
this acquisition significantly enhances the company s oncology testing capabilities 
dianon is recognized by physicians  managed care companies and other customers as a leading provider of a wide range of anatomic pathology testing services  which complement the company s strengths in other areas of cancer testing  particularly cytology 
the company expects that dianon s extremely effective specialized sales force  scientific expertise  efficient operating model and proprietary carepath clinical reporting system will allow it to enhance its cancer testing business and will position it to more effectively market and distribute the advanced testing technologies that the company has developed internally or has licensed from its technology partners  such as myriad genetics  inc  exact sciences corporation  celera diagnostics and correlogic systems  inc the company expects to achieve synergy savings relating to the integration of dianon of million in and total synergy savings of million by in february  the company announced an agreement to pay million in cash to purchase certain assets in northern california from quest diagnostics incorporated 
the assets to be purchased include the assignment of four contracts with independent physician associations ipas  as well as the leases for patient service centers  which are located throughout northern california 
acquiring these assets provides the company an immediate  competitive presence in northern california for the first time 
quest diagnostics has indicated that approximately million in annual revenues is generated by capitated fees under the ipa contracts and associated fee for service testing for physicians whose patients use these patient service centers  as well as from specimens received directly from the ipa physicians 
the ipas have already consented to the assignment of the contracts 
the asset sale to the company has been approved by the federal trade commission 
the company has announced a number of significant licensing and partnership agreements which provide it with access to new testing technologies that it expects will have an increasing impact on diagnostic testing 
in december  the company entered into exclusive licensing and marketing relationships with exact sciences and myriad genetics 
in june  the creation of an exclusive  long term strategic partnership with exact sciences to commercialize pregen plus  exact sciences proprietary  non invasive technology to aid in the early detection of colorectal cancer  was announced 
the company plans to launch this gene based test  which represents a significant new tool for the early detection of colorectal cancer  in the second half of as a result of the exclusive sales and distribution partnership with myriad genetics  physicians now have the convenience of sending patients to one of the company s patient service centers for myriad genetics predisposition testing for breast  ovarian  colon  uterine and melanoma skin cancers  as well as hypertension 
the company s relationship with myriad genetics makes it one of the few clinical laboratories in the us to provide the entire oncology care continuum from predisposition to surveillance testing  including screening  evaluation  diagnosis and monitoring options 
in october  the company announced a collaboration with celera to establish the clinical utility of laboratory tests based on novel diagnostic markers 
the initial areas of collaboration include efforts to improve the diagnosing of alzheimer s patients and to identify metastatic prostate cancer 
this exclusive relationship is a continuation of the company s strategy to develop a broad genomics testing menu for cancer 
in november  the company announced an agreement with correlogic systems to commercialize its ovarian cancer protein blood pattern test for the detection of ovarian cancer  which offers the prospect of accurate and early detection of ovarian cancer 
this is a common disease  which if detected early enough  is readily treated and often curable 
in addition to the acquisitions and relationships discussed above  the company believes future performance will be positively affected by several factors the expansion of higher value genomic tests such as cystic fibrosis  hcv and hiv genotyping  along with the continued growth of hiv viral loads and hpv testing  continued conversion of traditional pap smears to the newer  high value monolayer technology  continued progress with existing licensing and business relationships such as myriad genetics  exact sciences  correlogic and celera  the company s ongoing business acquisition strategy  growing demand for genomic testing is creating a positive shift in test mix toward higher value testing  and improving regulatory and reimbursement environment in washington  such as the cpi increase in the medicare national median lab fee schedule and the recent reversal in the proposed cuts to the physician services fee schedule 
as a result of the acquisitions of dynacare and dianon  coupled with expected internal growth  the company expects that revenues will grow approximately over revenue in the application of the statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  resulted in a decrease in amortization expense of approximately million for on october   the company s board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which the company may purchase up to an aggregate of million of its common stock from time to time 
there were no company purchases of its common stock during it is the company s intention to fund future purchases of its common stock with cash flow from operations 
seasonality volume of testing generally declines during the year end holiday periods and other major holidays 
in addition  volume declines due to inclement weather may reduce net revenues and cash flows 
therefore  comparison of the results of successive quarters may not accurately reflect trends or results for the full year 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods 
significant estimates include the allowances for doubtful accounts  amortization lives for intangible assets  accruals for self insurance reserves and reserves for professional liability claims 
the process for estimating the ultimate collection of receivables involves significant assumptions and judgments 
billings for services under third party payor programs  including medicare and medicaid  are recorded as revenues net of allowances for differences between amounts billed and the estimated receipts under such programs 
adjustments to the estimated receipts  based on final settlement with the third party payors  are recorded upon settlement as an adjustment to net revenues 
in addition  the company has implemented a process to estimate and review the collectibility of its receivables based on the period they have been outstanding 
historical collection and payor reimbursement experience is an integral part of the estimation process related to reserves for doubtful accounts 
the company also assesses the current state of its billing functions in order to identify any known collection or reimbursement issues in order to assess the impact  if any  on the reserve estimates  which involves judgment 
the company believes that the collectibility of its receivables is directly linked to the quality of its billing processes  most notably  those related to obtaining the correct information in order to bill effectively for the services provided 
revisions in reserve for doubtful accounts estimates are recorded as an adjustment to bad debt expense within selling  general and administrative expenses 
the company believes that its collection and reserves processes  along with the close monitoring of its billing processes  helps reduce the risk associated with material revisions to reserve estimates resulting from adverse changes in collection and reimbursement experience and billing operations 
effective january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
this standard requires that goodwill and other intangibles that are acquired in business combinations and that have indefinite useful lives are not to be amortized and are to be reviewed for impairment annually based on an assessment of fair value 
other intangibles patents and technology  customer lists and non compete agreements  are amortized on a straight line basis over the expected periods to be benefited  such as legal life for patents and technology  to years for customer lists and contractual lives for non compete agreements 
the impact of adopting sfas no 
is summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements 
accruals for self insurance reserves including workers compensation  auto and employee medical are determined based on historical payment trends and claims history  along with current and estimated future economic conditions 
professional liability reserves incorporate actuarially determined losses based upon the company s historical and projected loss experience 
while management believes these estimates are reasonable and consistent  they are by their very nature  estimates of amounts that will depend on future events 
accordingly  actual results could differ from these estimates

excluding acquisitions  revenues would have increased 
cost of sales  which includes primarily laboratory and distribution costs  was  million for compared to  million in  an increase of 
the majority of the increase in cost of sales is due to an increase in volume approximately million  with an additional increase of million due to increases in the volume of pap tests performed using monolayer technology 
in addition  the company incurred incremental costs of approximately million as it implemented a self mandated safety needle program 
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales was for and in the decrease in the cost of sales as a percentage of net sales primarily resulted from higher margin test mix  continued cost reduction efforts and economies of scale achieved through volume growth 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in representing an increase of million or
