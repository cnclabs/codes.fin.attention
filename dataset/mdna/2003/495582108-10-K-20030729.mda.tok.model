historical results and percentage relationships set forth in the statement of income  including trends that might appear  are not necessarily indicative of future operations 
please see the risk factors and forward looking statements sections for a discussion of the uncertainties  risks and assumptions associated with these statements 
recent developments the audited consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on form k reflect the effects of a million adjustment to our accrual for estimated amounts due under medicaid and other governmental pricing programs  an additional million charge relating to lorabid r  consisting of a million accrual for lorabid r purchase commitments in excess of expected demand and a million reduction from million to million in the previously announced lorabid r intangible asset impairment charge  and a deferral of million of revenue associated with a purchase of our products by the king benevolent fund  inc each of these adjustments arises from the internal review or is otherwise based on information that became available subsequent to the release of the unaudited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   contained in our form k dated april   and  under applicable accounting rules  is required to be reflected as of december the following table summarizes our net sales  operating income  net income and diluted income per common share  as previously reported in our form k dated april  and as reported in this annual report after accounting for the three adjustments described above in thousands  except per share data year ended december  income per common share net sales operating income net income diluted as previously as currently as previously as currently as previously as currently as previously as currently reported reported reported reported reported reported reported reported unaudited unaudited unaudited unaudited the data labeled as previously reported are presented for information purposes only in order to alert the reader that the results of operations previously reported in our form k dated april  differ from the audited results of operations as a result of the three adjustments described above 
these data are not presented in this annual report as a financial measure of our historical financial performance and should not be considered by investors and other readers of this annual report in their decision making 
sec investigation  medicaid and other governmental program accrual adjustment  and related matters as previously reported  in march  the sec initiated a formal investigation of king 
in light of the sec investigation  and as recommended by king s management  the audit committee of our board of directors initiated an assessment and internal review of the issues raised by the sec investigation and retained independent counsel  who retained an independent accounting firm  to assist the audit committee 
in connection with the internal review  king determined that it had underaccrued for estimated amounts due under medicaid and other governmental pricing programs  and recorded an adjustment of million to net sales and accrued expenses in the fourth quarter of this amount represents our best estimate of the extent to which we underpaid amounts due under medicaid and other governmental pricing programs during the period from to in connection with the accrual adjustment  we expect to recover on a pre tax basis approximately million of royalties we previously paid for altace r 
we also expect to recover on a pre tax basis approximately million of the promotional fees we previously paid under our co promotion agreement for altace r  but we have not completed discussions with our partner and therefore have not recorded this amount in our results for we have contacted the centers for medicare and medicaid services  the office of inspector general at the department of health and human services  and the department of justice in connection with the underpayments and expect to engage in more detailed discussions with these and other appropriate agencies in order to determine the precise amount of the underpayments 
we currently expect to make the requisite payments in the third or fourth quarter of pending determination of the precise amount of such payments  we have placed million in an interest bearing escrow account 
the accrual adjustment relates solely to the estimated underpayments and excludes any interest  fines  penalties or other amounts that might be owed in connection with the underpayments  as we cannot predict or reasonably estimate their likelihood or magnitude at this time 
of the aggregate adjustment to the accrual for estimated underpayments of amounts due under medicaid and other governmental pricing programs  approximately million reflects changes in accounting estimates under generally accepted accounting principles made in  and approximately million reflects corrections of immaterial errors related to and recorded in the fourth quarter of the remaining million reflects corrections of immaterial errors that occurred during to of this total of million  approximately million relates to underpayments in  million relates to underpayments in  million relates to underpayments in and million relates to underpayments in the impact of these immaterial errors in each of the years from to on net sales  operating income  net income and diluted income per common share for those years is set forth below in thousands  except per share data impact of impact of impact of income per impact of immaterial operating immaterial net immaterial common share immaterial net sales errors income errors income errors diluted errors for information on the impact of the immaterial errors in and on a quarterly basis  see note to our audited consolidated financial statements 
in connection with the internal review  the audit committee determined that our calculations related to medicaid and other governmental pricing programs have not followed all aspects of the prescribed methodology under the applicable statutes 
king s accrual adjustment relates to modifications to our methodologies for calculating average manufacturer price and best price both of which are reported to the government and used in determining amounts due under medicaid and other governmental pricing programs in response to changes in legal interpretations of complex and  in certain respects  ambiguous areas of medicaid rebate laws  recently compiled information with respect to the class of trade of our direct and indirect customers that affects our past calculations of average manufacturer price  and the correction of certain immaterial errors in the calculation of average manufacturer price and best price 
the accrual adjustment reflects both medicaid underpayments and amounts owing to other governmental agencies  such as the department of veterans affairs and the public health service  which utilize payment formulae that are similar to those applicable to the medicaid rebate program 
the audit committee concluded  after weighing all the information developed in the course of the internal review  that the underpayments requiring the accrual adjustment did not arise from an effort on the part of our current or prior management to mislead investors by manipulating reported financial results 
while the committee concluded that the errors did not result in any material financial misstatements  the committee stated that it believes that we need to dedicate additional attention and resources to ensure compliance with all applicable reporting requirements for medicaid rebates and other governmental pricing programs 
the committee noted the need to have in place systems  processes and personnel that provide reasonable assurance that such errors are unlikely to recur in the future 
management has reviewed with the committee the steps we have taken  are now taking and plan to take to address the issues raised by the incorrect medicaid and other governmental pricing programs filings made in the past  and to enhance our capabilities with respect to future medicaid and other governmental pricing calculations 
the committee stated that it intends to monitor carefully our ongoing discussions with appropriate regulatory authorities  as well as the implementation of proposed improvements to systems  processes  training and personnel 
the sec investigation of king is continuing 
in addition  as discussed above  we have contacted the centers for medicare and medicaid services  the office of inspector general at the department of health and human services  and the department of justice regarding amounts due under medicaid and other governmental pricing programs 
the sec  the centers for medicare and medicaid services  the office of inspector general  the department of justice and other governmental agencies that might be investigating or might commence an investigation of king could impose  based on a claim of a violation of fraud and false claims laws or otherwise  civil and or criminal sanctions  including fines  penalties and possible exclusion from federal health care programs including medicaid and medicare 
some of these laws may impose liability even in the absence of specific intent to defraud 
in addition  purported class action complaints have been filed by holders of our securities against us  our directors  former directors  executive officers and former executive officers  and seven purported shareholder derivative complaints have been filed  respectively alleging violations of federal securities laws and a breach of fiduciary duty  among other things  by some of our officers and directors 
if any governmental sanctions are imposed  or if we were not to prevail in the securities litigation  neither of which we can predict or reasonably estimate at this time  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
for additional information  please see the risk factors section under the heading the sec investigation  other possible governmental investigations  and securities litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we have undertaken a substantial process to enhance our compliance with medicaid and other governmental pricing program requirements 
in november  we began the process of implementing a new information technology system which has recently started to become operational 
as part of this effort  we have engaged outside consultants to ensure that the new information technology system collects and processes the data that we previously lacked for calculating average manufacturer price 
although the new information technology system is intended to significantly enhance the accuracy of our calculations for estimating amounts due under medicaid and other governmental pricing programs  our processes for these calculations will continue to involve considerable manual input  and  as a result  these calculations will remain subject to the risk of errors arising from manual processes 
we expect to further automate our processes for these calculations and expect to achieve a high level of automation in such processes by mid in addition  we have hired a senior director knowledgeable with respect to medicaid and other governmental pricing programs  and are continuing to search for and hire qualified personnel 
we have engaged outside consultants to assist us in our compliance efforts while we are in the process of further expanding our internal compliance staff 
we are committed to further enhancements and continue to identify and implement actions that improve our compliance with medicaid and other governmental pricing programs 
additional charge relating to lorabid r as previously disclosed  during the fourth quarter of  we decided to divest our rights to lorabid r 
as a result of a continuing decline of lorabid r prescriptions and our inability  to date  to divest our rights to lorabid r  subsequent to the release of the unaudited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   we determined that we will not be able to sell all the lorabid r we are required to purchase under our supply agreement with eli lilly 
accordingly  because of these further declines in lorabid r prescription trends  and because we had not finalized our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   we have revised our unaudited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  to record in the fourth quarter of a million charge related to the liability associated with the amount of the purchase commitments in excess of expected demand 
due to the further decline in our revenue projections for lorabid r as of july  we were also required to reassess the fair value of the lorabid r intangible assets 
previously  in the unaudited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   we reported that during the fourth quarter of we had recorded an intangible asset impairment charge of million and an additional intangible asset impairment charge of million 
based on our recent reassessment  and as a result of recording the million charge for lorabid r purchase commitments in excess of expected demand  we determined that the intangible asset impairment charge should be decreased from the aggregate of million  previously presented in the unaudited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   to million 
we determined the fair value of the lorabid r intangible asset based on the net present value of future estimated lorabid r cash flows 
the overall adjustment to the lorabid r charge presented in the unaudited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  is a net additional charge of million 
king benevolent fund transaction on december   we sold  net of a prompt pay discount of cortisporin r  silvadene r and tigan r to a third party wholesaler  which in turn resold those products to the king benevolent fund in january for  as of july   the benevolent fund had yet to distribute of the cortisporin r  of the silvadene r and of the tigan r purchased in january the expiration dates for the products still in inventory are july  or later for the cortisporin r  november  or later for the silvadene r and may  for the tigan r 
in light of the facts that a significant percentage of the products had not yet been distributed by the benevolent fund after more than six months and that the benevolent fund might be deemed to have been a related party for accounting purposes at the time of our sale  we have revised our previously released unaudited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  to defer recognition of the revenue from this sale to the third party wholesaler and to treat this sale in a manner analogous to the consignment method 
as of the date of shipment of the purchased products to the third party wholesaler  we have recorded deferred revenue in the amount of  and classified the purchased products as if they were consignment inventory at our cost of such inventory 
we will recognize the deferred revenue as the purchased products are distributed by the benevolent fund  which has agreed to provide us with the requisite information relating to the timing and amount of such distributions 
the deferral of recognition of  of revenue reduced by   and our previously reported unaudited operating income  net income and diluted income per common share  respectively 
based on the information provided to us by the benevolent fund with respect to its charitable distributions  we expect to recognize in the first and second quarters of  and  respectively  of the deferred revenue 
after weighing all the information developed in the course of the internal review  our audit committee concluded that this transaction did not arise from an effort to mislead investors by manipulating reported financial results  and that consummation of the sale had been in the best interests of king 
in connection with this conclusion  the audit committee also determined that it would be desirable for king to provide detailed disclosure of the nature and extent of our relationship with the benevolent fund and this transaction beyond that required by applicable rules 
please see the certain relationships and related transactions section 
overview general our growth in primarily resulted from continued increased sales of our three largest products altace r  levoxyl r and thrombin jmi r 
significant milestone events occurring since the end of that we believe expand and enhance our opportunities for continued growth include the completion of our acquisition of meridian medical technologies  inc  our acquisition of rights to intal r  tilade r and synercid r from aventis and our acquisition of elan s primary care business in the united states and puerto rico  which includes sonata r and skelaxin r and elan s united states primary care sales force 
we believe that these developments  which include expanded pipeline opportunities  together with the continued sales growth of our existing key products  especially altace r  position king for future growth 
sales of key products in the following discussion  net sales for reflect a million charge for corrections of immaterial errors related to underpayments of amounts due under medicaid and other governmental pricing programs for the years to  a million charge for corrections of immaterial errors related to underpayments of amounts due under medicaid and other governmental pricing programs related to and recorded in the fourth quarter of  and a million charge arising from changes made in in accounting estimates for the years to related to medicaid and other governmental pricing programs 
for additional information  see this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section under the heading recent developments 
altace r net sales of altace r  an ace inhibitor  grew to million for the year ended december   a increase from million during the prior year 
altace r new prescriptions totaled approximately million and total prescriptions equaled approximately million during  increases of and  respectively  over the prior year according to ims america monthly prescription data 
monthly total prescriptions of altace r exceeded one million for the first time during december according to ims america data 
contributing also to the continued sales growth of altace r is the sustained shift to mg altace r  the same dose used in the landmark hope trial 
specifically  total prescriptions for mg altace r during increased approximately over the prior year  in comparison to an increase of for the other strengths of altace combined  according to ndc health monthly prescription data 
additionally  price increases contributed to the continued sales growth of altace r during based on altace r s differentiating indications  positive clinical data and prescription trends  along with our marketing strategies and a composition of matter patent that should protect altace r from generic competition through  we anticipate that annual net sales of altace r should continue to grow  but not at as high a rate as that achieved in levoxyl r levoxyl r net sales grew to million for the year ended december   a increase from million during the prior year 
in addition to continued prescription growth  the increase in sales of levoxyl r during was primarily due to a reduction in discounting and implementation of a branded pricing strategy 
during the first six months of  levoxyl r net sales were million 
we have submitted in excess of patent applications relating to our novel quick dissolving formulation of levoxyl r 
the first us patent on levoxyl r  a utility patent with composition of matter claims  was issued on april  and extends through february  thrombin jmi r net sales of thrombin jmi r totaled million in  a increase from million during the prior year 
contributing to this growth was our successful implementation of strategies which increased our unit production capacity for thrombin jmi r at our middleton  wisconsin facility by approximately during we are  however  near capacity at this facility  which will limit our ability to increase unit production of thrombin jmi r 
we are currently working on long term strategies to further expand our manufacturing capacity for thrombin jmi r 
net sales of thrombin jmi r should continue to grow during  but not at as high a rate as that achieved in strategic developments elan s primary care business on june   we acquired the primary care business of elan and of some of its subsidiaries in the united states and puerto rico  which includes the rights to two branded prescription pharmaceutical products  including the rights to potential new formulations of sonata r skelaxin r  together with elan s united states primary care field sales force 
product rights subject to the agreement include those related to sonata r  a nonbenzodiazepine treatment for insomnia  and skelaxin r  a muscle relaxant  in the united states  its territories and possessions  and puerto rico 
under the terms of the agreement  elan s sale of skelaxin r included related ndas  copyrights  trademarks  patents and us rights to potential new formulations of skelaxin r 
elan s sale of sonata r included its rights to the product  as well as certain related copyrights 
we also acquired certain intellectual property  regulatory  and other assets relating to sonata r directly from wyeth 
under the terms of the agreement  we secured an exclusive license to the intellectual property rights  in this territory  of both wyeth and elan to the extent they relate to new formulations of sonata r  other than for use in animals 
we paid approximately million at closing 
the million purchase price included the transfer of inventory with a value of approximately million 
we also will pay royalties on the current formulation of skelaxin r from the date of closing and up to million if elan achieves certain milestones in connection with the development of a reformulated version of sonata r  have a potential milestone payment of million if annual net sales of a reformulation of sonata r exceed million  and potentially will pay an additional million milestone payment to elan relating to the ongoing exclusivity of skelaxin r on january  prior to the closing of this transaction  we had received a letter on march  from the ftc stating that it was conducting an investigation to determine whether any person has engaged in unfair methods of competition with respect to elan s product skelaxin r 
the focus of this investigation was elan s listing in the fda s orange book of at least one patent claiming a method of using metaxalone  and other actions with regard to fda regulatory processes 
as a result of this new information  we commenced an investigation and asked elan to provide additional information 
on march   elan filed a lawsuit in the supreme court of the state of new york seeking to compel us to close the transaction 
on may   the ftc advised elan that it was discontinuing a portion of its investigation with respect to this method of use patent 
on may   we reached an agreement with elan that restructured the terms of the transaction as described above  and  as a result  the litigation has since been dismissed 
eon labs and corepharma have each filed an anda with the fda pertaining to metaxalone  the active ingredient in skelaxin r  to which we acquired certain rights from elan on june  the allegations in eon labs and corepharma s notice relate to a patent covering a method of using metaxalone  which does not expire until december we intend to vigorously enforce our rights under this patent 
meridian medical technologies  inc on january   we completed our acquisition of meridian  for a cash price totaling million 
meridian pioneered the development  and is a leading manufacturer  of auto injectors for the self administration of injectable drugs 
an auto injector is a pre filled  pen like device that allows a patient or caregiver to automatically inject a precise drug dosage quickly  easily  safely  and reliably 
this acquisition provides us with additional lines of growing exclusive pharmaceutical products  auto injector technology  and enhanced pipeline opportunities 
meridian had net sales of million for its fiscal year ended july  meridian s growing commercial pharmaceutical business primarily consists of epipen r  an auto injector filled with epinephrine for the emergency treatment of anaphylaxis resulting from severe or allergic reactions to insect stings or bites  foods  drugs  and other allergens  as well as idiopathic or exercise induced anaphylaxis

meridian also has growing lines of pharmaceutical products that are presently sold primarily to the us department of defense under an industrial base maintenance contract 
these products include atropen r  an atropine filled auto injector  and combopen r  a pralidoxime filled auto injector  both used as nerve gas antidotes  a diazepam filled auto injector for treatment of seizures  and a morphine filled auto injector for pain management 
additionally  meridian is completing the development of a dual chambered auto injector and injection process  with patent protection to  which should provide an improved  more efficient means of delivering nerve gas antidotes 
intal r  tilade r and synercid r on december   we acquired the rights to three branded prescription pharmaceutical products from aventis 
the products include the rights in the united states  puerto rico and canada to intal r and tilade r  and worldwide rights  excluding japan  to synercid r 
total upfront cash consideration paid by king for the three branded pharmaceutical products totaled million 
intal r and tilade r are non steroidal anti inflammatory agents for the treatment of asthma 
the differentiating attributes of intal r and tilade r include their unique mechanism of action and excellent safety profiles  the latter of which is extremely important for pediatric patients and in other patient sub populations for whom safety is a particular concern 
a new intal r inhaler formulation utilizing hfa  an environmentally friendly propellant  is currently under review by the fda 
the hfa formulation of intal r is patented in the united states until september tilade r has a composition of matter patent in the united states until october we believe our acquisition of intal r and tilade r provides us with access to the respiratory pharmaceutical market  which is currently experiencing significant growth and is the fourth largest therapeutic market in the world 
synercid r is an injectable antibiotic indicated for treatment of vancomycin resistant enterococcus faecium and treatment of some complicated skin and skin structure infections 
synercid r  which is primarily administered in hospitals  has a formulation patent in the united states until november as additional consideration to aventis for synercid r  king has agreed to potential milestone payments totaling million 
king will potentially pay aventis milestone payments totaling million over the next three years  payable in annual installments of million  million  and million beginning on december   which relate to the continued recognition of synercid r as an effective treatment for vancomycin resistant enterococcus faecium 
the remaining million milestone is payable to aventis if synercid r should receive fda approval to treat methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus  or king will pay aventis a one time payment of million the first time during any twelve month period net sales of synercid r exceed million  and a one time payment of million the first time during any twelve month period net sales of synercid r exceed million 
atropen r on june   we received fda approval of our snda covering pediatric and adult formulations of our nerve gas antidote atropen r 
our receipt of this approval is significant in that this is the first time that pediatric formulations of this important homeland security product have been approved for use in the united states 
atropen r utilizes the auto injector technology we acquired in our january acquisition of meridian 
we do not anticipate being able to distribute pediatric formulations of this product before the first quarter of pipeline opportunities while continuing to execute our acquisition growth strategies with respect to currently marketed products  we have also continued to expand and enhance our pipeline opportunities 
we currently have three pipeline product applications submitted and under review by the fda  and other compounds in various stages of development 
estrasorb tm in september  novavax resubmitted to the fda an nda for estrasorb tm  a topical estrogen replacement therapy in a unique lotion formulation for symptomatic menopausal women 
king has an exclusive worldwide license to promote  market  distribute  and sell estrasorb tm  following approval  except in the united states and puerto rico  where king and novavax will co market the product 
fda approval for estrasorb tm is anticipated during the second half of intal r hfa as part of the transaction with aventis on december   we acquired rights to a new inhaler formulation of intal r utilizing hfa  an environmentally friendly propellant 
the hfa formulation of intal r is currently under review by the fda and is patented in the united states until september we anticipate fda approval of this product during diazepam filled auto injector an anda for our diazepam filled auto injector  now sold primarily to the us department of defense  is currently under review by the fda 
once approved  king plans to market this product commercially as the only adjunctive injectable therapy  outside of a hospital setting  for the emergency treatment of status epilepticus and severe recurrent convulsive seizures associated with epilepsy 
currently  the only competing  self administered therapy requires a rectal administration 
fda approval for our diazepam filled auto injector is anticipated during the second half of sonata r we have entered into an agreement with elan for the development of a modified release formulation of sonata r 
skelaxin r we have entered into an agreement with elan relating to new formulation development for skelaxin r 
binodenoson we recently completed the phase ii dose ranging study for binodenoson  our second generation cardiac pharmacologic stress imaging agent 
the results of the phase ii dose ranging study are being used to plan protocols for two pivotal phase iii studies involving binodenoson  the first of which is expected to begin during the second half of modified release altace r we have a license agreement with skyepharma to develop and commercialize a modified release formulation of altace r utilizing skyepharma s patented oral drug delivery technology geomatrix r 
other developments decision to divest lorabid r assets we have a supply agreement with eli lilly to produce lorabid r 
this supply agreement requires us to purchase minimum levels of inventory of lorabid r through august during the fourth quarter of  we decided to divest our rights to lorabid r and reviewed the related intangible assets for impairment 
prior to that  we considered our supply agreement with eli lilly and the need to evaluate it for the effects of potential excess purchase commitments 
based on changes in estimated prescription trends  we believe the minimum purchase commitments under the supply agreement are greater than inventory quantities we will be able to sell to our customers 
as a result  we have recorded a million charge related to the liability associated with the amount of purchase commitments in excess of expected demand 
based on our review for impairment of intangible assets  as updated for management s cash flow expectations as of july  we have determined that the lorabid r intangible assets were impaired and have recorded an impairment charge of million to write down the assets to their estimated fair value as of december  we donated million of lorabid r inventory to a charitable organization as a result of the decision to divest our rights to lorabid r 
if sales of lorabid r continue to decline  if we terminate the supply agreement with eli lilly  or if we are unable to secure adequate lorabid r inventory purchase commitments from a buyer of lorabid r rights  we may incur additional losses in the future 
generic competition on march   the fda approved impax labs anda for fludrocortisone acetate tablets  a generic for florinef r 
on january   the fda approved barr laboratories anda for a second generic for florinef r 
as of december   we had intangible assets related to florinef r with carrying values of million 
we have completed our impairment review and have recorded an impairment charge in the amount of million in the first quarter of reflecting the reduction in the fair value of the florinef r intangible assets 
we determined the fair value of our florinef r product based on management s current discounted cash flow projections for the product 
in march  we also became aware that an anda for cortisporin r ophthalmic suspension which was previously inactive has been reactivated by the fda with a new sponsor 
we understand the sponsor entered the market as of april  with a generic equivalent for cortisporin r ophthalmic suspension 
the entry of the generic has negatively affected our market share for this product 
at december   we had intangible assets related to cortisporin r of approximately million 
at this point in time  we do not anticipate an intangible asset impairment charge related to cortisporin r ophthalmic suspension 
altace r patent challenge cobalt pharmaceuticals a generic drug manufacturer located in mississauga  ontario  canada  has filed an anda with the fda seeking permission to market a generic version of altace r prior to the expiration of u 
s 
patent no 
 the patent  a composition of matter patent relating to altace r  which is listed in the fda s orange book 
we also recently listed us patent no 
 the patent  a method of use patent relating to altace r in the fda s orange book 
the patent does not expire until october and the patent does not expire until under the federal hatch waxman act of  cobalt has filed an anda alleging that the patent is invalid 
this allegation is commonly known as a paragraph iv certification 
under the terms of the hatch waxman legislation  any generic manufacturer may file an anda with a paragraph iv certification after the pioneer company  or its successor in interest  has marketed the product for four years 
regulations do not require cobalt to certify against the patent 
we are privy to the conclusions of well qualified patent counsel who have concluded that the patent should prove clearly enforceable 
based on this opinion and other opinions  we have a high degree of confidence that the composition of matter patent should be enforceable  and we intend to vigorously enforce the patent against this challenge 
we have filed suit to enforce our rights to the patent 
moreover  we has recently amended our complaint  without opposition  to include an allegation of infringement of the patent by cobalt 
if these patents  we successfully challenged  cobalt may market a generic equivalent of altace r prior to october but not before january  the expiration date of us patent no 
 the patent  which is another composition of matter patent that relates to and is listed in the fda s orange book for altace r and which has not been challenged by cobalt 
the filing of our suit provides us an automatic stay of fda approval of the anda for months 
however  should the court grant cobalt summary judgment on the patent  we would not receive the benefit of the automatic stay 
levoxyl r patent challenge mylan pharmaceuticals  a generic drug manufacturer  filed an anda with the fda seeking permission to market a generic version of levoxyl r prior to the expiration of our patent which was issued to us on april  we received notice of the paragraph iv certification on april  and have subsequently filed suit to enforce our rights under the patent being challenged 
additionally  on june   we received a notice of paragraph iv certification related to the patent from kv pharmaceuticals 
we intend to enforce our rights under the patent to the fullest extent of the law 
prefest r on may   we acquired from ortho mcneil pharmaceutical  inc  a johnson johnson subsidiary  all the rights to prefest r tablets in the united states  its territories and possessions  and the commonwealth of puerto rico  including the related nda  investigational nda  copyrights and patents or licenses to these patents for which we paid million at closing 
during february  we paid ortho mcneil an additional million upon receipt of the fda s approval to rename the product prefest  which was formerly named ortho prefest 
this product  a single tablet combination hormone replacement therapy with an intermittent progestin administration  together with a continuous administration of estrogen  has a preparation patent listed in the fda s orange book that expires in january  as well as a second orange book listed patent that expires in april the progestin in prefest r tablets represents the lowest dose of progestin in any of these products 
this characteristic  combined with the product s lipid and triglyceride level profile  differentiates prefest r tablets from competing therapies 
women s health initiative clinical trial an ongoing clinical trial  the women s health initiative  is being conducted by the national institutes of health 
data from that trial released in july indicated that an increase in certain health risks may result from the long term use of a competitor s combination hormone replacement therapy for women 
news of this data and the perception it has created have negatively affected the entire combination hormone replacement therapy and the oral estrogen replacement therapy  which include our products prefest r  delestrogen r and menest r and may affect our future marketing efforts for estrasorb tm 
the following summarizes net revenues by operating segment in thousands for the years ended december  branded pharmaceuticals    royalties    contract manufacturing    other    total    branded pharmaceuticals segment net revenues for reflect a a  charge for corrections of immaterial errors related to underpayments of amounts due under medicaid and other governmental pricing programs for the years to  b a  charge for corrections of immaterial errors related to underpayments of amounts due under medicaid and other governmental pricing programs related to and recorded in the fourth quarter of  and c an  charge arising from changes in accounting estimates related to medicaid and other governmental pricing programs 
for additional information  see the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section under the heading recent developments and note to our audited consolidated financial statements 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues total net revenue increased million  or  to  million in from million in  due primarily to the growth and acquisition of branded pharmaceutical products 
net sales from branded pharmaceutical products increased million  or  to  million in from million in this increase was due primarily to growth in net sales of altace r  levoxyl and thrombin jmi r  the acquisition of corzide r  delestrogen r and florinef r and a license to corgard r in august  and the acquisition of prefest r on may  this increase was partially offset by a million charge for corrections of immaterial errors related to underpayments of amounts due under medicaid and other governmental pricing programs for the years to  a million charge for corrections of immaterial errors related to underpayments of amounts due under medicaid and other governmental pricing programs related to and recorded in the fourth quarter of  a million charge arising from changes made in in accounting estimates for the years to related to medicaid and other governmental pricing programs  and decreases in net sales of lorabid r  tapazole r and several women s health products 
net sales from branded pharmaceutical products for have not been reduced by estimated underpayments of amounts due under medicaid and other governmental pricing programs for that year 
we expect continued growth in net sales of our branded pharmaceuticals  due primarily to the anticipated increase in net sales of altace r  the intal r  tilade r and synercid r product acquisition on december  and the acquisition of sonata r and skelaxin r on june  although we expect overall net sales of our branded pharmaceuticals to grow  we expect sales of lorabid r  florinef r  cortisporin r ophthalmic suspension and women s health products to decrease due to the developments explained above 
we refer you to the risk factors section in this annual report where we describe events that could cause results to materially differ 
revenue from royalties is derived from payments we receive based on sales of adenoscan r and adenocard r 
revenues from royalties increased million  or  to million in from million in primarily due to an increase in unit sales of adenoscan r 
while we anticipate continued growth from royalty revenues  we are not responsible for the marketing of these products and  thus  are not able to predict whether growth in will continue at the rate experienced in revenues from contract manufacturing increased million  or  to million in from million in the majority of the increase was due to increased unit volume of products manufactured for third parties in compared to we anticipate a significant increase in contract manufacturing revenue in due to the acquisition of meridian on january  revenue from all other sources  which primarily includes the sale of generic pharmaceuticals  decreased million  or  to million in from million in primarily due to decreased sales of a private label generic product line to another pharmaceutical company 
operating costs and expenses total operating costs and expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to special items during resulting in a net charge of million  cost of revenues associated with increased unit sales of our branded pharmaceutical products  and increased fees associated with the promotion of altace r under our co promotion agreement with wyeth  offset by special items during resulting in a net charge of million 
special items are those particular income or expense items that our management believes are not related to our ongoing  underlying business  are non recurring  or are not generally predictable 
these items include  but are not limited to  merger and restructuring expenses  non capitalized expenses associated with acquisitions  such as in process research and development charges and one time inventory valuation adjustments charges  charges resulting from the early extinguishment of debt  asset impairment charges  expenses of drug recalls  and gains and losses resulting from the divestiture of assets 
we believe the identification of special items enhances an investor s analysis of our ongoing  underlying business and of our financial results when comparing those results to that of a previous or subsequent like period 
however  it should be noted that the determination of whether to classify an item as a special item involves judgments by our management 
cost of revenues increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to costs associated with increased unit sales of our branded pharmaceutical products  including altace r  levoxyl r and thrombin jmi r  and an increase in special items related to inventory totaling million during  as compared to a net charge totaling million during special items were as follows as a result of a continuing decline of lorabid r prescriptions and our inability  to date  to divest our rights to lorabid r  we have determined that we will be unable to sell all of the lorabid r inventory that we are required to purchase under our supply agreement with eli lilly 
accordingly  we have recorded in the fourth quarter of a million charge related to the liability associated with the amount of the purchase commitments in excess of expected demand 
we incurred a charge of million relating to inventory donations during the fourth quarter of  attributable to our decision to divest our rights to lorabid r

we have contacted the centers for medicare and medicaid services  the office of inspector general at the department of health and human services  and the department of justice in connection with the underpayments and expect to engage in more detailed discussions with these and other appropriate agencies in order to determine the precise amount of the underpayments

critical accounting policies we have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to accurately and fairly report our operating results and financial position  and we apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner 
the significant accounting policies are summarized in note to our audited consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities are affected by such estimates and assumptions 
the most significant assumptions are employed in estimates used in determining allowances for doubtful accounts  values of inventories and intangible assets  impairment  accruals for rebates  returns and chargebacks  as well as estimates used in applying the revenue recognition policy and accounting for novavax convertible senior notes and the co promotion agreement with wyeth 
we are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those estimates  such as changes in the healthcare environment  competition  legislation and regulation 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical because they involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful receivables for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our trade customers to make required payments 
we provide an allowance for specific customer accounts where collection is doubtful and also provide a general allowance for other accounts based on historical collection and write off experience 
judgment is necessary and if the financial condition of our customers were to worsen  additional allowances may be required 
inventories 
our inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value 
we evaluate all of our inventory for short dated or slow moving product and inventory commitments under supply agreements based on projections of future demand and market conditions 
for those units in inventory that are so identified  we estimate their market value or net sales value based on current realization trends 
if the projected net realizable value is less than cost  on a product basis  we provide a provision to reflect the lower value of that inventory 
this methodology recognizes projected inventory losses at the time such losses are evident rather than at the time goods are actually sold 
intangible assets 
when we purchase products we classify the purchase price  including expenses and assumed liabilities  as intangible assets 
the purchase price is allocated to product rights  trademarks  patents and other intangibles using the assistance of valuation experts 
we estimate the useful lives of the assets by factoring in the characteristics of the products such as patent protection  competition by products prescribed for similar indications  estimated future introductions of competing products  and other issues 
the factors that drive the estimate of the life of the asset are inherently uncertain 
long lived assets 
we review our property and intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
assumptions and estimates used in the evaluation of impairment may affect the carrying value of long lived assets  which could result in impairment charges in future periods 
such assumptions include projections of future cash flows and  in some cases  the current fair value of the asset 
in addition  our depreciation and amortization policies reflect judgments on the estimated useful lives of assets 
accruals for rebates  returns  and chargebacks 
we establish accruals for rebates  returns  and chargebacks in the same period we recognize the related sales 
the accruals reduce revenues and are included in accrued expenses 
accrued rebates include amounts due under medicaid  managed care rebates and other commercial contractual rebates 
we estimate accrued rebates based on a percentage of selling price determined from historical experience 
with respect to accruals for estimated medicaid rebates  we evaluate our historical rebate payments by product as a percentage of historical sales  product pricing and current contracts 
at the time of rebate payment  which generally occurs with a delay after the related sale  we record a reduction to accrued expenses and  at the end of each quarter  adjust accrued expenses for any differences between estimated and actual payments 
due to estimates and assumptions inherent in determining the amount of the rebates  rebate payments remain subject to retroactive adjustment 
returns are accrued based on historical experience 
chargebacks are based on the estimated days of unprocessed claims using historical experience 
in all cases  judgment is required in estimating these reserves  and actual claims for rebates  returns and chargebacks could be different from the estimates 
medicaid and certain other governmental pricing programs involve particularly difficult interpretations of relevant statutes and regulatory guidance  which are complex and  in certain respects  ambiguous 
moreover  prevailing interpretations of these statutes and guidance can change over time 
revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss are transferred to customers  collection of sales is reasonably assured and we have no further performance obligations 
this is generally at the time products are received by the customer 
accruals for estimated returns  rebates and chargebacks  determined based on historical experience  reduce revenues at the time of sale and are included in accrued expenses 
medicaid and certain other governmental pricing programs involve particularly difficult interpretations of relevant statutes and regulatory guidance  which are complex and  in certain respects  ambiguous 
moreover  prevailing interpretations of these statutes and guidance can change over time 
royalty revenue is recognized based on a percentage of sales namely  contractually agreed upon royalty rates reported by third parties 
for the year ended december   we deferred recognition of revenue associated with a purchase of our products by the king benevolent fund 
we will recognize the deferred revenue as the purchased products are distributed by the benevolent fund 
see note to our audited consolidated financial statements 
novavax convertible senior notes 
our novavax convertible senior notes are carried at cost  with a valuation allowance which reduces the convertible senior notes to estimated fair value 
the estimated fair value was determined by the quoted market price of the underlying securities at the end of the period 
the amount of the valuation allowance will be adjusted in future periods based on the value of the underlying collateral novavax common stock as of the last business day of each respective calendar quarter or until such time as the loan is no longer considered to be impaired 
co promotion agreement with wyeth 
we have a co promotion agreement with wyeth to promote altace r 
a million upfront fee was paid to us by wyeth and this fee is being amortized on a straight line basis over the life of the agreement as a reduction of co promotion marketing expenses 
co promotion fees are paid to wyeth based on a percentage of net sales of altace r 
we accrue co promotion fees paid by us at the rate expected for the entire year 
the rate is adjusted during the year  if necessary  as it becomes clearer what the actual rate will be 
co promotion marketing expenses are marketing costs incurred by either us or wyeth in accordance with the co promotion agreement 
co promotion marketing expenses are expensed ratably throughout the year based on our expected portion of the total co marketing expenses incurred by both parties 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk certain of our financial instruments are subject to market risks  including interest rate risk 
our financial instruments are not currently subject to foreign currency risk or commodity price risk 
we have no financial instruments held for trading purposes 
we have marketable securities which are carried at fair value based on current market quotes 
gains and losses on securities are based on the specific identification method 
the fair market value of long term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates rise and decrease as interest rates fall 
in addition  the fair value of our convertible debentures would be impacted by our stock price 
the estimated fair value of our total long term debt at december  was million 
fair values were determined from available market prices  using current interest rates and terms to maturity 
if interest rates were to increase or decrease  the fair value of our long term debt would increase or decrease by approximately million 
at december   and  we did not hold any derivative financial instruments
