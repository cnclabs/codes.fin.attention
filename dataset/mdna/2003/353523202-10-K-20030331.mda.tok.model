item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation details regarding the company s financial performance are presented in the following discussion  which should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
general franklin national bank represents virtually all of the assets of franklin financial corporation 
the bank  headquartered in franklin  tennessee  was opened in december of and continues to experience substantial growth 
the bank has nine full service branches located throughout williamson  davidson and maury counties 
in august  the bank opened an insurance subsidiary  franklin financial insurance 
in october  the bank opened a securities subsidiary  franklin financial securities 
the securities subsidiary offers financial planning and securities brokerage services through fifth third securities 
in december  the bank began operating its mortgage division as a separate subsidiary  franklin financial mortgage 
also in january  the mortgage subsidiary began a wholesale mortgage operation and in august  opened a retail mortgage origination office in chattanooga  tennessee 
franklin financial mortgage originates  sells and services mortgage loans 
in june  the company formed franklin capital trust i  a delaware business trust and wholly owned subsidiary of the company  for the purpose of issuing trust preferred securities to the public 
in december  the company received approval from the federal reserve bank to convert from a bank holding company to a financial holding company to allow the company additional avenues for growth opportunities 
critical accounting policies various elements of our accounting policies  by their nature  are inherently subject to estimation techniques  valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments 
in particular  we have identified two policies that  due to the judgments  estimates and assumptions inherent in those policies  are critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements 
these policies relate to the methodology for the determination of our allowance for loan and lease losses and to the valuation of our mortgage servicing rights 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level which  in management s judgment  is adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the amount of the allowance is based on management s evaluation of the collectibility of the loan portfolio  including the nature of the portfolio  credit concentrations  trends in historical loss experience  specific impaired loans  and economic conditions 
allowances for impaired loans are generally determined based on collateral values or the present value of estimated cash flows 
a loan is considered impaired when management has determined it is possible that all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement will not be collected 
the allowance is increased by a provision for loan losses  which is charged to expense and reduced by charge offs  net of recoveries 
servicing assets on loans sold are measured by allocating the previous carrying amount between the assets sold and the retained interests based on their relative fair values at the date of transfer 
our mortgage servicing rights are related to in house originations serviced for others 
the initial amount recorded as mortgage servicing rights is essentially the difference between the amount that can be realized 
table of contents when loans are sold  with servicing released  as compared to loans sold  with servicing retained 
mortgage servicing rights are amortized in proportion to  and over the period of  estimated net servicing revenues 
impairment of mortgage servicing rights is assessed based on the fair value of those rights 
these policies and the judgments  estimates and assumptions are described in greater detail in note to the consolidated financial statements included herein 
we believe that the judgments  estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are appropriate given the factual circumstances at the time 
however  given the sensitivity of our consolidated financial statements to these critical accounting policies  the use of other judgments  estimates and assumptions could result in actual results differing from those estimates 
liquidity and capital resources general 
the company maintains its liquidity through the management of its assets and liabilities 
the company strives to maintain an asset liability mix that provides the highest possible net interest margin without taking undue risk with regard to asset quality or liquidity 
liquidity management involves meeting the funds flow requirements of customers who may withdraw funds on deposit or have need to obtain funds to meet their credit needs 
banks in general must maintain adequate cash balances to meet daily cash flow requirements as well as satisfy reserves required by applicable regulations 
the cash balances held are one source of liquidity 
other sources are provided by the investment portfolio  federal funds purchased  federal home loan bank advances  sale of loan participations  loan payments  brokered and public funds deposits and the company s ability to borrow funds as well as issue new capital 
management believes liquidity is at an adequate level with cash and due from banks of million at december  loans and securities scheduled to mature within one year exceeded million at december   which should provide further liquidity 
in addition  approximately million of securities are classified as available for sale to help meet liquidity needs should they arise 
based on the current interest rate environment  the bank anticipates million in cash flow from its investment portfolio over the next year as a source of liquidity to help fund loan demand 
the company has a line of credit of million with a lending institution and the bank is approved to borrow up to million in funds from the federal home loan bank and million in federal funds lines to assist with capital and liquidity needs 
at december   the company had million in borrowings against its line of credit and the bank had no federal funds purchased outstanding 
the line of credit with the lending institution includes financial covenants requiring a i minimum loan loss reserve to non performing assets ratio  ii minimum loan loss reserve to total loans  iii maximum ratio of non performing loans to total loans  iv minimum return on average assets and v minimum tangible shareholder s equity 
the company was in violation of the loan loss allowance to non performing assets covenant at december   which was subsequently waived by the leading institution 
in february and august  the bank entered into long term convertible federal home loan bank advances with a ten year maturity and one year call option totaling million 
during the fourth quarter of these advances converted to variable rate advances  which reprice quarterly based on libor 
on july  and august  the company completed the sale of million and million  respectively  of trust preferred securities the trust preferred securities 
the company received net proceeds of million from the offering  which it used to repay approximately million of indebtedness under its line of credit  purchase investments as part of a leverage program to offset the interest expense associated with the trust preferred securities and for general corporate purposes  including capital investments in the bank 
the trust preferred securities pay cumulative cash distributions accumulating from the date of issuance at an annual rate of three month libor plus of the liquidation amount of  per preferred security on january  april  july and october of each year 
the trust preferred securities have a thirty year maturity and may be redeemed by the company beginning in july or upon the 
table of contents occurrence of certain other conditions 
subject to certain limitations  the trust preferred securities qualify as tier capital and are carried in other borrowings on the company s balance sheet 
the company purchased approximately million of investment securities in a leverage program to gain immediate income benefits and offset interest expense of the trust preferred securities 
this leverage program was funded through proceeds from the offering of the trust preferred securities  million of federal home loan bank advances and brokered certificates of deposit 
the objectives of the leverage program are to realize a basis point spread between investment yields and borrowings  to utilize cash flow from the investments purchased to help fund future loan demand and to limit interest rate shock exposure in the up basis point rate shock scenario 
as part of the leverage program to offset interest expense associated with the trust preferred securities offering  during the third quarter of  the bank entered into three long term convertible federal home loan bank advances 
one advance of million has a ten year maturity with a three year call option 
the other two advances totaling million have a five year maturity with a one year call option 
after the three and one year call options  these advances may be converted by the fhlb from a fixed rate to a variable rate 
the bank has  outstanding in repurchase agreements to further develop its relationship with a customer 
the bank had approximately million in brokered deposits at december  to help fund strong loan demand 
the majority of these deposits are  or less  but they are generally considered to be more volatile than the bank s core deposit base 
approximately million in loan commitments are expected to be funded within the next six months 
furthermore  the bank has approximately million of other loan commitments  primarily unused lines and letters of credit  which may or may not be funded 
capital expenditures 
other than expenditures relating to the normal course of business  the company does not have any significant capital expenditures planned for management monitors the company s asset and liability positions in order to maintain a balance between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities and at the same time maintain sufficient liquid assets to meet expected liquidity needs 
management believes that the company s liquidity is adequate at december  other than as set forth above  there are no trends  demands  commitments  events or uncertainties that will result in or are reasonably likely to result in the company s liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way 
the company is not aware of any current recommendations by the regulatory authorities which if they were to be implemented would have a material effect on the company s liquidity  capital resources  or results of operations 
cash flows 
net cash flow provided by operating activities was million in proceeds from the sale of loans exceeded loans originated for sale by million in the majority of this loan origination volume is due to the increase in loans originated in the mortgage banking segment 
accrued interest payable decreased  and other assets increased million creating additional uses of funds by operating activities 
the use of cash flow is offset by net income of million and an increase in other liabilities of million 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  which was largely due to the banking segment 
the increase in the change in net loans was million in the net change in the investment portfolio also increased million in growth in the investment portfolio has slowed due to cashflow from the investment portfolio being redeployed to loan portfolio fundings 
this liquidity shift was one of the strategic objectives of the leverage program related to the trust preferred securities offering in as previously discussed 
the use of cash flow in investing activities is also attributed to an increase in federal funds of million 

table of contents net cash provided by financing activities was million in the increase in cash flow is primarily due to an increase in deposits of million in cash provided by financing activities is offset partially by million of dividends paid and a decrease in repurchase agreements of million 
interest rate sensitivity 
the following is an analysis of rate sensitive assets and liabilities as of december  mos 
mos 
yrs 
or more yrs 
total securities loans federal funds sold total rate sensitive assets now deposits savings deposits time deposits repurchase agreements other borrowings total rate sensitive liabilities excess deficiency of rate sensitive assets less rate sensitive liabilities excess deficiency as a percentage of earning assets cumulative excess deficiency cumulative excess deficiency as a percentage of earnings assets as indicated in the preceding table  the negative gap in the month and month categories between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities would allow the company to reprice its liabilities faster than its assets in a falling rate environment which should have a positive effect on earnings 
however  in an increasing interest rate environment  the company may experience a short term decrease in earnings 
the above table has been prepared based on principal payment due dates  contractual maturity dates or repricing intervals on variable rate instruments 
with regard to mortgage backed securities  the estimated prepayment date is used 
actual payments on mortgage backed securities are received monthly and therefore should occur earlier than the contractual maturity date 

table of contents capital adequacy 
stockholders equity at december   was million or of total assets compared to million or of total assets at december  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
as set forth in the following table  equity capital of the company and the bank exceeded regulatory requirements as of december  minimum for capital for well company adequacy capitalized consolidated bank s purposes category actual actual leverage ratio tier risk based ratio total risk based ratio financial condition total assets have grown million  or  since december  to a total of million at december  the growth during has been funded by a million increase in deposits and net income of million 
total deposits were million at december  the company continues to experience excellent loan demand as demonstrated by the growth in net loans of million  or  since december  the allowance for loan losses increased million  or  from the level at december   to a total of million or approximately of total loans 
the increase in the allowance for loan losses is primarily the result of growth in the loan portfolio as opposed to significant deterioration in credit quality 
the company has seen significant growth in construction and commercial real estate loans  which carry a higher reserve factor 
management believes that the level in the allowance for loan losses is adequate at december  management reviews in detail the level of the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis 
in addition  during the company hired an internal loan review analyst 
this internal position allows for more frequent and a higher volume of loan review 
the allowance is below the bank s peer group average as a percentage of loans  however the bank s past due loans  at of total loans at december   have historically been below peer group average 
past due loans are higher than usual at december   due to the recessionary economy and two large loan relationships being place on nonaccrual 
at december   the bank had non accrual loans of million compared to non accrual loans of million at december  the bank had one large relationship of million that was placed on non accrual status during the third quarter of management feels the bank has adequate collateral on this loan relationship and does not expect to experience a loss 
at december   the bank had loans that were specifically classified as impaired of approximately million compared to million at december  the specific allocations of the allowance for loan losses related to impaired loans was  at december  compared to  at december  the average carrying value of impaired loans was approximately million for the year ended december  interest income of approximately  was recognized on these impaired loans during the year ended december  loans held for sale decreased million  or  since december  loans held for sale are carried at fair value 
at december  the fair value of securities classified as available for sale exceeded the cost of the securities by million 
at december   cost of the securities classified as 
table of contents available for sale exceeded the fair value of securities by  as a result  unrealized loss gain net of taxes of million and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  is included in other comprehensive income in the stockholders equity section of the balance sheet 
the change in unrealized gain loss is due to economic market conditions and slight decreases in long term interest rates during late see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
available for sale securities increased million  or  during due to overall bank growth 
held to maturity securities decreased million  or  due to security calls within the held to maturity category 
premises and equipment decreased  or  during primarily due to depreciation expense offset partially by costs related to software and equipment costs related to the implementation of a document imaging system 
accrued interest receivable increased  or  during due to increases of million in the bank s loan and securities portfolios offset by continuing decreases in interest rates in foreclosed assets decreased million in accrued interest payable decreased  or  during the decrease is due to the continuing decreases in interest rates during offset partially by increases in interest bearing deposits of million in stockholders equity increased million  or from december  to december  the increase in stockholders equity is primarily attributable to million in net income and a million increase in other comprehensive income offset slightly by million in dividends declared 
results of operations fiscal compared with fiscal the company had net income of million in compared to million in the company had income before taxes of million in  representing a increase from the million recorded in total interest income increased  or  in as compared to  while total interest expense decreased million  or  in as compared to the increase in total interest income is attributable to an increase in average earning assets of million  or  in  offset significantly by a decrease in rates 
a large portion of the bank s loans are variable rate which causes interest income to decrease faster in a declining rate environment 
the increase in total interest income is primarily due to the banking segment 
the decrease in interest expense is attributable to decreases in interest rates offset by an increase in average interest bearing liabilities of million  or  in the bank s deposits are relatively short term in nature  which allows them to reprice faster than our rate sensitive assets 
in a decreasing rate environment  as in  this asset liability structure was significantly favorable as deposits were repricing which help to offset the variable rate loan repricing 
this short term deposit portfolio has significantly increased the net interest margin in the declining rate environment as net yield increased from in to in the provision for loan losses was million in as compared to million in while asset quality remains good  increases in the provision for loan losses have been necessary due to growth in the bank s loan portfolio and as previously discussed  the bank s impaired loans have increased primarily due to the recessionary economy and one large problem loan relationship 
net charge offs were million or 
of average loans outstanding in  as compared to  or  of average loans outstanding in the bank had a  problem loan relationship which resulted in a portion of the increase in the provision for loan losses 
the bank charged off the  of loans related to this relationship during the first nine months of

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s financial performance is subject to risk from interest rate fluctuations 
this interest rate risk arises due to differences between the amount of interest earning assets and the amount of interest bearing liabilities subject to repricing over a specified period and the amount of change in individual interest rates 
the liquidity and maturity structure of the company s assets and liabilities are important to the maintenance of acceptable net interest income levels 
an increasing interest rate environment negatively impacts earnings as the company s rate sensitive liabilities generally reprice faster than its rate sensitive assets 
conversely  in a decreasing interest rate environment  earnings are positively impacted 
this potential asset liability mismatch in pricing is referred to as gap and is measured as rate sensitive assets divided by rate sensitive liabilities for a defined time period 
a gap of means that assets and liabilities are perfectly matched as to repricing within a specific time period and interest rate movements will not affect net interest margin  assuming all other factors hold constant 
management has specified gap guidelines for a one year time horizon of between 
and at december   the company had a gap ratio of 
for the one year period ending december  thus  over the next twelve months  slightly more rate sensitive liabilities will reprice than rate sensitive assets 

table of contents a basis point decrease in interest rates spread evenly during is estimated to cause an increase in net interest income of  as compared to net interest income if interest rates were unchanged during in comparison  a basis point increase in interest rates spread evenly during is estimated to cause a decrease in net interest income of  as compared to net interest income if rates were unchanged during this level of variation is within the company s acceptable limits 
this simulation analysis assumes that savings and checking interest rates have a low correlation to changes in market rates of interest and that certain asset prepayments change as refinancing incentives evolve 
the analysis takes into account the call features of certain investment securities based on the basis point rate shock scenario 
further  in the event of a change of such magnitude in interest rates  the company s asset and liability management committee would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the change 
however  given the uncertainty of specific conditions and corresponding actions which would be required  the analysis assumes no change in the company s asset liability composition
