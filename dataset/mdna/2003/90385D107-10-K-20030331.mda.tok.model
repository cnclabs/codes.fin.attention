ceridian is obligated to pay to ultimate software a minimum of approximately million  including million received to date  over the minimum term of the ceridian agreement  which is expected to be years the minimum term 
the effect of the change in revenue recognition for the ceridian agreement was to modify the date at which revenue recognition would begin changing the onset of the revenue recognition process from february   which was the date the company completed a successful transfer of technology to ceridian  to the earlier of i the delivery of the ultipro release also known as evolution  or ii january  the change in the timing of revenue recognition applied to the ceridian agreement does not impact ceridian s payment obligations to the company over the minimum term nor does it impact the nature of the underlying business transaction 
on august   ultimate software delivered the ultipro release to ceridian 
the delivery of ultipro marked the commencement of recurring revenue recognition for the ceridian transaction at the minimum rate of approximately  per month from that date through march on february   ultimate software and ceridian entered into an agreement which provided that if ultimate software were to deliver ultipro on or before august   ceridian would pay ultimate software  for such advanced delivery the evolution bonus

total revenues  consisting of license  recurring and service revenues  decreased to million for from million for license revenues decreased to million for from million for the decrease in license revenues for is primarily due to a reduction in the number of new units sold by the company s direct sales channel during the first half of which management believes was partly due to unfavorable economic conditions  partially offset by increased sales of ultipro to existing clients using the company s dos based product  ultipro for lan dos clients  which had a lower average sales price

the company revised its former requirement for strategic partners to pay an upfront license fee along with ongoing per employee per month pepm fees by de emphasizing the upfront license fee and emphasizing the recurring revenue from pepm fees 
the planned result was to provide a higher percentage of recurring revenue in the bsp channel with correspondingly lower upfront commitments

during july and december  the company raised an additional aggregate amount of million of capital through the private sale of  shares of the company s common stock and a warrant to purchase  shares of common stock at per share 
as the company s revenue mix shifts from license revenue to recurring revenue  particularly through the intersourcing offering  and cash inflow consequently shifts from relatively large  one time upfront payments to recurring monthly payments  the company may seek to raise additional funds through the sale of additional shares of common stock or other securities or through borrowings 

table of contents the capital raised in july included the sale of  shares of common stock and a warrant to purchase  shares of common stock at per share  for an aggregate amount of  to an irrevocable trust established by a member of the company s board of directors the director 
the director has informed the company that he has no voting or investment power or other controlling interest in this irrevocable trust

the credit facility  as amended  expires on may  and bears interest at a rate equal to prime rate plus per annum reduced to prime rate plus per annum upon two consecutive quarters of net profitability  as defined 
the credit facility provides working capital financing for up to of the company s eligible accounts receivable  as defined  financing for eligible equipment purchases for up to million with additional limits for software purchases the equipment term note  and stand by letters of credit for up to million 
the equipment term note is payable in equal monthly installments  plus interest at prime rate plus 
the maximum amount available under the credit facility is million 
at december   approximately million was available for borrowing under the credit facility and approximately million was outstanding under the equipment term note 
borrowings under the credit facility are secured by all of the company s corporate assets  including a negative pledge on intellectual property  and the company is required to comply with certain financial and other covenants 
as of december   the company was in compliance with all covenants included in the terms of the credit facility 
the company believes that cash and cash equivalents  cash generated from operations  cash generated from recent capital raised  cash generated from the ceridian services agreement and available borrowings under the credit facility  as amended on march   will be sufficient to fund its operations for at least the next months 
this belief is based upon  among other factors  management s expectations for future revenue growth  controlled expenses and collections of accounts receivable 
however  as discussed above  the company may seek to raise additional funds during such period through the sale of additional shares of common stock or other securities 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to raise such funds on terms acceptable to the company 
quarterly fluctuations the company s quarterly revenues and operating results have varied significantly in the past and are likely to vary substantially from quarter to quarter in the future 
the company s operating results may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors  including  but not limited to  increased expenses especially as they relate to product development and sales and marketing  timing of product releases  increased competition  variations in the mix of revenues  announcements of new products by the company or its competitors and capital spending patterns of the company s customers 
the company establishes its expenditure levels based upon its expectations as to future revenues  and  if revenue levels are below expectations  expenses can be disproportionately high 
a drop in near term demand for the company s products could significantly affect both revenues and profits in any quarter 
operating results achieved in previous fiscal quarters are not necessarily indicative of operating results for the full fiscal years or for any 
table of contents future periods 
as a result of these factors  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to establish or  when established  maintain profitability on a quarterly basis 
the company believes that  due to the underlying factors for quarterly fluctuations  period to period comparisons of its operations are not necessarily meaningful and that such comparisons should not be relied upon as indications of future performance
