our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations relates to ferrellgas partners and the operating partnership 
ferrellgas partners finance corp 
and ferrellgas finance corp 
have nominal assets  do not conduct any operations and have no employees 
ferrellgas partners finance corp 
may act as co obligor of future issuances of debt securities of ferrellgas partners and ferrellgas finance corp 
may act as co obligor of future issuances of debt securities of the operating partnership 
accordingly  and due to the reduced disclosure format  a discussion of the results of operations  liquidity and capital resources of ferrellgas partners finance corp 
and ferrellgas finance corp 
are not presented 
the following is a discussion of our historical financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the discussions set forth in the results of operations and liquidity and capital resources sections generally refer to ferrellgas partners and its consolidated subsidiaries 
however  there do exist three material differences between ferrellgas partners and the operating partnership 
those material differences are o the two partnerships incur different amounts of interest expense on their outstanding indebtedness  see the statements of earnings in their respective consolidated financial statements and notes h long term debt in the respective notes to their consolidated financial statements  o during the three months ended october   ferrellgas partners incurred million in expenses related to the early extinguishment of its debt  and o ferrellgas partners issued common units in fiscal and to fund the redemption of senior units 
forward looking statements statements included in this report include forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are identified as any statement that does not relate strictly to historical or current facts 
they often use words such as anticipate  believe  intend  plan  projection  forecast  strategy  position  continue  estimate  expect  may  will  or the negative of those terms or other variations of them or comparable terminology 
these statements often discuss plans  strategies  events or developments that we expect or anticipate will or may occur in the future and are based upon the beliefs and assumptions of our management and on the information currently available to them 
in particular  statements  expressed or implied  concerning our future operating results or our ability to generate sales  income or cash flow are forward looking statements 
forward looking statements are not guarantees of performance 
you should not put undue reliance on any forward looking statements 
all forward looking statements are subject to risks  uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by these forward looking statements 
many of the factors that will affect our future results are beyond our ability to control or predict 
some of our forward looking statements include the following o whether the operating partnership will have sufficient funds to meet its obligations  including its obligations under its debt securities  and to enable it to distribute to ferrellgas partners sufficient funds to permit ferrellgas partners to meet its obligations with respect to its existing securities  o whether ferrellgas partners and the operating partnership will continue to meet all of the quarterly financial tests required by the agreements governing their indebtedness  o the expectation that future periods may not have the same percentage increase in revenues  cost of sales and interest expense as was experienced during fiscal  and o the expectation that future periods will have increased depreciation expense over the amount recognized during fiscal when considering any forward looking statement  you should also keep in mind the risk factors in business risk factors 
any of these risks could impair our business  financial condition or results of operation 
any such impairment may affect our ability to make distributions to our unitholders or pay interest on the principal of any of our debt securities 
in addition  the trading price  if any  of our securities could decline as a result of any such impairment 
except for our ongoing obligations to disclose material information as required by federal securities laws  we undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statements or risk factors after the date of this annual report 
in addition  the classification of ferrellgas partners and the operating partnership as partnerships for federal income tax purposes means that we do not generally pay federal income taxes 
we do  however  pay taxes on the income of our subsidiaries that are corporations 
we rely on a legal opinion from our counsel  and not a ruling from the internal revenue service  as to our proper classification for federal income tax purposes 
see risk factors tax risks the irs could treat us as a corporation for tax purposes  which would substantially reduce the cash available for distribution to our unitholders 
results of operations fiscal year ended july  vs 
july  propane and other gas liquids sales 
propane and other gas liquids sales increased million primarily due to an increase in the average propane sales price per gallon and an additional million primarily due to an increase in retail propane sales volume 
the average sales price per gallon increased due to the effect of a significant increase in the wholesale cost of propane during fiscal as compared to the prior year period 
the wholesale market price at one of the major supply points  mt 
belvieu  texas  averaged per gallon during fiscal  compared to an average of per gallon in the prior year period 
other major supply points in the united states also experienced significant increases 
retail sales volumes also increased million gallons compared to the prior year period  primarily due to colder winter temperatures  and to a lesser extent  acquisitions 
for the heating season november through march  temperatures as reported by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa  were relatively normal as compared to being warmer than normal in the prior year period  which was the third warmest heating season in recorded united states history 
cost of product sold 
cost of product sold increased million primarily due to an increase in the wholesale price of propane and increased an additional million primarily due to the effect of an increase in our retail sales volume compared to the prior year period 
this increase was offset by improved results from risk management trading activities that resulted in a decrease of million in our cost of product sold compared to the prior year period 
gross profit 
gross profit increased primarily due to the effect of the increase in our retail propane volumes 
improved results from our risk management trading activities were largely offset by retail margins that  although better than expected  were less than the prior year period 
we were able to temporarily increase the retail margins in the prior year period to partially offset the impact of significantly warmer winter temperatures 
see additional discussion regarding risk management trading activities in item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
operating expense 
operating expense increased primarily due to expenses related to acquisitions completed during fiscal  increased expenses related to our technology initiative and increased vehicle related fuel and oil costs 
depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased primarily due to the effect of one of our intangible assets completing its amortizable life in fiscal this was partially offset by the increased depreciation and amortization related to acquisitions and the buyout of operating tank leases completed during fiscal equipment lease expense 
equipment lease expense decreased due to the effect of the december buyout of our operating tank leases 
see further discussion about the buyout of these leases in liquidity and capital resources investing activities 
interest expense 
interest expense increased due to increased borrowings for the buyout of previously leased propane tanks in december and to finance acquisitions 
this increase was partially offset by the effect of refinancing fixed rate debt at a lower interest rate 
see further discussion about the increased borrowings to buyout these leases in liquidity and capital resources financing activities 
net earnings 
net earnings decreased primarily due to increased operating expenses  a million early extinguishment of debt expense related to the repurchase and redemption of our million senior secured notes and the million cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle related to the adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  partially offset by the increase in gross profit 
see further discussion in note i asset retirement obligations to our consolidated financial statements 
these decreases were substantially offset by the increase in gross profit 
interest expense and net earnings of the operating partnership interest expense 
the operating partnership s interest expense increased due to increased credit facility borrowings related to the buyout of previously leased propane tanks in december see further discussion about the increased borrowings to buyout these leases in liquidity and capital resources financing activities 
net earnings 
the operating partnership s net earnings increased primarily due to the effect of the increase in retail propane volumes 
this increase was partially offset by the increased operating expenses and the million cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle related to the adoption of sfas no 
the operating partnership was not affected by ferrellgas partner s million early extinguishment of debt expense related to the repurchase and redemption of its million senior secured notes 
forward looking statements 
assuming that the weather remains the same as in fiscal and that interest rates remain relatively stable  except for the possible effect of any potential asset acquisitions  we do not anticipate similar increases in fiscal for revenue  cost of sales  operating expenses and interest expense as was recognized in fiscal versus fiscal we do expect depreciation and amortization expense to increase due to depreciation expense related to software for our technology initiative  which was placed in service in the first quarter of fiscal fiscal year ended july  vs 
july  propane and other gas liquids sales 
propane and other gas liquids sales decreased million due to a decrease in the average propane sales price per gallon and an additional million primarily due to a significant decrease in retail propane sales volume 
the propane wholesale market price at one of our major supply points  mt 
belvieu  texas  averaged per gallon during fiscal compared to an average of per gallon for the prior year 
other major supply points in the united states also experienced significant declines in propane prices 
however  cost of product sold increased million due to exceptional results from risk management trading activities recognized in fiscal that were not repeated in fiscal see additional discussion regarding risk management trading activities in quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
the average propane sales price per gallon decreased due to the effect of a significant decrease in the wholesale cost of propane 
in addition  retail sales volumes decreased to million gallons in fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily due to the effect of the significantly warmer than normal weather and to a lesser extent the weak national economy 
the heating season of fiscal november through march was the third warmest in recorded united states history  according to the noaa data  with national average temperatures warmer than normal as compared to colder than normal for the same period during the prior fiscal year 
during the peak winter heating season december through february average national temperatures were warmer than normal 
other revenues 
other revenues decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily due to lower appliance sales and service labor related to the effect of the weak national economy 
cost of product sold 
cost of product sold decreased million due to the significant decline in the wholesale cost of propane during fiscal and an additional million primarily due to the effect of the decline in retail sales volume compared to last year 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased primarily due to the effect of a significant decrease in retail propane volumes and to a lesser extent  the decrease in results from risk management trading activities 
these factors were partially offset by an increase in retail margin per gallon 
operating expense 
operating expense decreased primarily due to a million decrease in operating expenses incurred at our retail distribution outlets generally resulting from fewer gallons delivered to customers in fiscal as compared to fiscal general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense increased primarily due to increased performance based incentive compensation expense 
depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased primarily due to the implementation of sfas no 
 which eliminated goodwill amortization 
see further discussion of the implementation of sfas no 
in note b summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements 
equipment lease expense 
equipment lease expense decreased due to the impact that significantly lower interest rates had on our variable rate operating leases as compared to fiscal loss on disposal of assets and other 
loss on disposal of assets and other decreased million primarily due to a decrease in the activity related to the transfer of accounts receivables pursuant to the accounts receivable securitization facility 
see further discussion about this facility in liquidity and capital resources operating activities 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased primarily due to reduced borrowings and the impact that significantly lower interest rates had on our credit facility borrowings 
this decrease was partially offset by the effect of the termination of an interest rate swap agreement in the fourth quarter of fiscal net earnings 
net earnings increased primarily due to decreased depreciation and amortization expenses and decreased equipment lease expenses 
interest expense and net earnings of the operating partnership interest expense 
the operating partnership s interest expense decreased due to reduced borrowings and the impact that significantly lower interest rates had on our credit facility borrowings 
net earnings 
the operating partnership s net earnings decreased primarily due to the effect of a decrease in the average propane sales price per gallon  a decrease in retail propane sales volume and an increase in general and administrative expense 
liquidity and capital resources our ability to satisfy our obligations is dependent upon future performance  which will be subject to prevailing economic  financial  business  and weather conditions and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
due to the seasonality of the retail propane distribution business  a significant portion of our cash flow from operations is generated during the winter heating season which occurs during our second and third fiscal quarters 
typically  we generate significantly lower cash flows from operations in our first and fourth fiscal quarters as compared to the second and third fiscal quarters because fixed costs exceed gross profit during the non peak heating season 
subject to meeting the financial tests discussed below  our general partner believes that the operating partnership will have sufficient funds available to meet its obligations  and to distribute to ferrellgas partners sufficient funds to permit ferrellgas partners to meet its obligations during fiscal in addition  our general partner believes that the operating partnership will have sufficient funds available to distribute to ferrellgas partners sufficient cash to pay the required quarterly distribution on the senior units and the minimum quarterly distribution on all common units during fiscal the minimum quarterly distribution of paid on all common units on september   represents the thirty sixth consecutive minimum quarterly distribution paid to our common unitholders dating back to october our bank credit facility  public debt  private debt and accounts receivable securitization facility contain several financial tests and covenants restricting our ability to pay distributions  incur debt and engage in certain other business transactions 
in general  these tests are based on our debt to cash flow ratio and cash flow to interest expense ratio 
our general partner currently believes that the most restrictive of these tests are debt incurrence limitations under the terms of our bank credit and accounts receivable securitization facilities and limitations on the payment of distributions within the terms of our senior notes due the bank credit and accounts receivable securitization facilities generally limit the operating partnership s ability to incur debt if it exceeds prescribed ratios of either debt to cash flow or cash flow to interest expense 
our senior notes restrict payments if a minimum ratio of cash flow to interest expense is not met  assuming certain exceptions to this ratio limit have previously been exhausted 
this restriction places limitations on our ability to make restricted payments such as the payment of cash distributions to unitholders 
the cash flow used to determine these financial tests generally is based upon our most recent cash flow performance giving pro forma effect for acquisitions and divestitures made during the test period 
it should be noted that our bank credit facility  public debt  private debt and accounts receivable securitization facility do not contain repayment provisions related to a decline in our credit rating 
as of july   our general partner believes that we met all the required quarterly financial tests and covenants during fiscal based upon current estimates of our cash flow  our general partner believes that we will be able to continue to meet all of the required quarterly financial tests and covenants during fiscal however  if we were to encounter unexpected downturns in business operations in the future  such as significantly warmer than normal winter temperatures  a volatile energy commodity cost environment or continued economic downturn  we may not meet the applicable financial tests in future quarters 
this could have a materially adverse effect on our operating capacity and cash flows and could restrict our ability to incur debt or to make cash distributions to our unitholders  even if sufficient funds were available 
depending on the circumstances  we may consider alternatives to permit the incurrence of debt or the continued payment of the quarterly cash distribution to our unitholders 
no assurances can be given  however  that such alternatives can or will be implemented with respect to any given quarter 
our future capital expenditures and working capital needs are expected to be provided by a combination of cash generated from future operations  existing cash balances  the bank credit facility or the accounts receivable securitization facility 
to fund expansive capital projects and future acquisitions  we may borrow on our facilities  we may issue additional debt to the extent permitted under existing financing arrangements or we may issue additional equity securities  including  among others  common units 
toward this purpose  on june   a shelf registration statement was declared effective by the sec for the periodic sale by us of up to million of equity and or debt securities 
the registered securities are available to us for sale from time to time in the future to fund acquisitions  to reduce indebtedness  to redeem senior units or to provide funds for general corporate purposes 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we received million  after underwriting discounts  commission and expenses  from the issuance of million common units to the public from this shelf registration statement 
see further discussion about this equity offering in liquidity and capital resources financing activities 
we also maintain a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission for the issuance of up to million common units 
we may issue these common units in connection with our acquisition of other businesses  properties or securities in business combination transactions 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal this increase was primarily due to higher proceeds from accounts receivable securitization activity  partially offset by the effect of higher wholesale cost of product  the timing of collections of accounts receivable and the timing of purchases of and payments for inventory 
the fiscal winter heating season required more working capital to finance operating activities than the fiscal winter heating season because of the effect of financing the purchase and sale of greater volumes of retail propane at higher average wholesale costs 
accounts receivable securitization at july   million had been funded from our accounts receivable securitization facility 
this funding resulted from our increased liquidity needs caused primarily by the seasonal increase in accounts receivable outstanding and in propane inventory levels 
we renewed this facility effective september   for a day commitment with banc one  na in accordance with sfas no 
 these transactions are reflected on our consolidated financial statements as sales of accounts receivable and a retained interest in transferred accounts receivable 
see further discussion in note e accounts receivable securitization in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
the operating partnership net cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal  compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million for fiscal  for the reasons disclosed above 
investing activities on december   we purchased million of equipment whose lease terms would have expired in june see financing activities and note h long term debt to our consolidated financial statements for discussion about the financing of these equipment lease buyouts 
we continue to consider opportunities to expand our operations through strategic acquisitions of retail propane operations located throughout the united states 
during fiscal  we made total acquisition capital expenditures of approximately million for five retail propane companies  which included the acquisition of million of working capital 
these expenditures were mainly funded by million in cash payments  the issuance of thousand common units valued at an aggregate of million and million in the issuance of a non interest bearing note payable to the seller and other costs and consideration 
during fiscal  we made cash capital expenditures of million related to our technology initiative and million consisting primarily of the following o upgrading district plant facilities  o vehicle lease buyouts  and o additional propane storage tanks and cylinders 
during fiscal  we completed a review of our key business processes to identify areas where we could use technology to improve our operational efficiency 
specifically  we identified areas where we believe we can reduce operating expenses and improve customer satisfaction in the near future 
these areas of opportunity include improvements to our routing and scheduling of customer deliveries  customer administration and operational workflow 
during fiscal and  we allocated considerable resources toward these improvements  including the purchase of computer hardware and software and development of new software 
the capital expenditures related to this technology initiative were funded primarily from net cash provided by operating activities 
these capital expenditures represent a substantial majority of the capital expenditures we expect to incur in connection with this technology initiative 
we intend to fund any remaining capital requirements from cash generated from future net cash provided by operating activities or funds available from our credit facility 
we incurred the following expenditures related to this technology initiative between fiscal and capital expenditures expensed items in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal development of new computer software   purchased computer software and licenses  computer hardware and other equipment operating expense   general and administrative expenses  total incurred      plus cash payments for items incurred in prior year  less amounts payable to vendors  total cash used for technology initiative      we lease property  computer equipment  propane tanks  light and medium duty trucks  tractors and trailers 
we believe leasing is a cost effective method for meeting our equipment needs 
during fiscal  we purchased million of vehicles whose lease terms expired during fiscal the operating partnership the investing activities discussion above also applies to the operating partnership  except for cash flows related to business acquisitions 
during fiscal  the operating partnership made total acquisition capital expenditures of million pursuant to the acquisition of four retail propane companies 
in addition  during december  ferrellgas partners acquired and contributed a propane company to the operating partnership 
financing activities credit facility on december   we refinanced our million bank credit facility with a million amended bank credit facility 
this amended bank credit facility will terminate on april   unless extended or renewed 
this million amended bank credit facility consists of the following o a million revolving working capital facility  general partnership and acquisition facility  including an million letter of credit sub facility  and o a million revolving facility  which was used december   to purchase propane tanks and related assets that we previously leased 
all borrowings under the amended bank credit facility bear interest  at our option  at a rate equal to either o a base rate  which is defined as the higher of the federal funds rate plus or bank of america s prime rate as of july   the federal funds rate and bank of america s prime rate were and  respectively  or o the eurodollar rate plus a margin varying from to as of july   the one month eurodollar rate was 
in addition  an annual commitment fee is payable on the daily unused portion of the credit facility at a per annum rate varying from to as of july   the commitment fee per annum rate was 
at july   million of borrowings and million of letters of credit were outstanding under the amended bank credit facility 
letters of credit are currently used to cover obligations primarily relating to requirements for insurance coverage and  to a lesser extent  our risk management activities 
at july   we had million available for working capital  acquisition  capital expenditure and general partnership purposes under the amended bank credit facility 
we believe that the liquidity available from the amended bank credit facility and the accounts receivable securitization facility will be sufficient to meet our future working capital needs for fiscal see investing activities for discussion about our accounts receivable securitization facility 
however  if we were to experience an unexpected significant increase in working capital requirements  our working capital needs could exceed our immediately available resources 
events that could cause increases in working capital borrowings or letter of credit requirements include  but are not limited to the following o a significant increase in the wholesale cost of propane  o a significant delay in the collections of accounts receivable  o increased volatility in energy commodity prices related to risk management activities  o increased liquidity requirements imposed by insurance providers  o a significant downgrade in our credit rating  o decreased trade credit  or o a significant acquisition 
if one or more of these events caused a significant use of available funding  we may consider alternatives to provide increased working capital funding 
no assurances can be given  however  that such alternatives would be available  or  if available  could be implemented 
long term debt on september   we issued  in a public offering  million of senior notes due interest is payable semi annually in arrears on june and december these senior notes are unsecured and not redeemable before june   except under specific circumstances 
we used the proceeds from the million senior note issuance to repurchase and redeem our million senior secured notes due and to fund related premiums  fees  accrued and unpaid interest and tender consent payments 
on december   we issued  in a public offering  an additional million of senior notes with the same terms as the million senior notes 
we used the proceeds from the million senior note issuance to reduce borrowings under the amended bank credit facility and to provide increased availability of funds for working capital  acquisition  capital expenditure and general partnership purposes 
the million senior notes were issued with a debt premium of million that will be amortized to interest expense through fiscal the following table summarizes our long term debt obligations as of july principal payments due by fiscal year in thousands and thereafter total long term debt  including current portion       see note h long term debt to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the maturity dates and interest rates related to our long term debt 
distributions we paid the required distributions on the senior units and the minimum quarterly distribution on all common units  as well as general partner interests  totaling million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the required quarterly distribution on the senior units and the minimum quarterly distribution on all common units for the three months ended july  was paid on september  to holders of record on august  see related disclosure about the distributions and redemptions of senior units in disclosures about effects of transactions with related parties 
common unit equity issuance and senior unit redemption during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we received million  after underwriting discounts  commission and expenses  from the issuance of million common units to the public 
we used these net proceeds to redeem million senior units and to pay the related accrued senior unit distribution 
during fiscal and we received million and million in connection with to the issuance of million and thousand common units pursuant to the ferrellgas unit option plan 
see note p unit options of ferrellgas and stock options of ferrell companies  inc to our consolidated financial statements  for additional disclosure about the ferrellgas unit option plan 
on april   we announced a series of transactions that increased the cash distribution coverage to our public common unitholders and modified the structure of our outstanding senior units 
in addition  we announced that an entity owned by our general partner s chairman  chief executive officer and president  james e 
ferrell  purchased all the outstanding senior units from the williams companies for a purchase price of million plus accrued and unpaid distributions 
we pay the senior units a quarterly cash distribution equivalent to percent per annum of the liquidating value  currently per quarter 
we can redeem the senior units at any time  in whole or in part  upon payment in cash of the liquidating value of the senior units  currently per unit  plus the amount of any accrued and unpaid distributions 
the holder of the senior units has the right  subject to various events and conditions  to convert any outstanding senior units into common units beginning on the earlier of december  or upon the occurrence of a material event as defined by our partnership agreement 
the number of common units issuable upon conversion of a senior unit is equal to the senior unit liquidation value  divided by the then current market price of a common unit 
generally  a material event includes a change of control  the treatment of ferrellgas partners as an association taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes  ferrellgas partners failure to use the aggregate cash proceeds from equity issuances  other than issuances of equity pursuant to an exercise of any common unit options  to redeem a portion of its senior units other than up to million of cash proceeds from equity issuances used to reduce ferrellgas partners indebtedness  or ferrellgas partners failure to pay the senior unit distribution in full for any fiscal quarter 
such conversion rights are contingent upon us not previously redeeming such securities 
also  ferrell companies granted us the option  until december   to defer future distributions on the common units held by it up to an aggregate outstanding amount of million 
as of july   we have not elected to defer any common unit distributions due ferrell companies 
the operating partnership the financing activities discussion above also applies to the operating partnership except for cash flows related to distributions  the issuance of the senior notes due  the issuance of common units and the redemption of senior units

disclosures about effects of transactions with related parties we have no employees and are managed and controlled by our general partner 
pursuant to our partnership agreement  our general partner is entitled to reimbursement for all direct and indirect expenses incurred or payments it makes on our behalf  and all other necessary or appropriate expenses allocable to us or otherwise reasonably incurred by our general partner in connection with operating our business 
these costs  which totaled million for fiscal  include compensation and benefits paid to employees of our general partner who perform services on our behalf  as well as related general and administrative costs 
during fiscal  we paid jef capital management million to redeem a total of million senior units and million in senior unit distributions 
we accrued a senior unit distribution of million that we subsequently paid to jef capital management on september  jef capital management is beneficially owned by james e 
ferrell  the chairman  president and chief executive officer of our general partner  and thus is an affiliate 
during fiscal  our named executive officers exercised ferrellgas unit options 
see executive compensation aggregated ferrellgas unit option exercises in last fiscal year and fiscal year end option values for details about these transactions ferrell international limited and fi trading  inc are beneficially owned by james e 
ferrell and thus are also our affiliates 
we enter into transactions with ferrell international limited and fi trading in connection with our risk management activities and do so at market prices in accordance with our affiliate trading policy approved by our general partner s board of directors 
these transactions include forward  option and swap contracts and are all reviewed for compliance with the policy 
during fiscal  we recognized net disbursements from purchases  sales and commodity derivative transactions of million 
these net purchases  sales and commodity derivative transactions with ferrell international limited and fi trading  are classified as cost of product sold on our consolidated statements of earnings 
there were no amounts due from to ferrell international limited or fi trading at july  we believe these related party transactions were under terms that were no less favorable to us than those available with third parties 
see both certain relationships and related transactions and note m transactions with related parties to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 
off balance sheet arrangements our off balance sheet arrangements include the leasing of transportation equipment  property  computer equipment and propane tanks 
we account for these arrangements as operating leases 
we believe these arrangements are a cost effective method for financing our equipment needs 
these off balance sheet arrangements enable us to lease equipment from third parties rather than  among other options  purchasing the equipment using on balance sheet financing 
see further discussion about these leases in investing activities 
most of the operating leases involving our transportation equipment contain residual value guarantees 
these transportation equipment lease arrangements are scheduled to expire over the next seven years 
most of these arrangements provide that the fair value of the equipment will equal or exceed a guaranteed amount  or we will be required to pay the lessor the difference 
although the fair values at the end of the lease terms have historically exceeded these guaranteed amounts  the maximum potential amount of aggregate future payments we could be required to make under these leasing arrangements  assuming the equipment is worthless at the end of the lease term  is million 
we do not know of any event  demand  commitment  trend or uncertainty that would result in a material change to these arrangements

sfas no 
requires the recognition of a liability if a company has a legal or contractual financial obligation in connection with the retirement of a tangible long lived asset 
we implemented sfas no 
beginning in the fiscal year ending july  this cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle resulted in a one time charge to earnings of million at the beginning of the year ended july   together with the recognition of a million long term liability and a million long term asset 
see note i asset retirement obligations for further discussion of these obligations 
we believe the implementation will not have a material ongoing effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
sfas no 
modifies the financial accounting and reporting for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale and it broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions 
we implemented sfas no 
beginning in the fiscal year ending july   with no material effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
sfas no 
eliminates the requirement that material gains and losses resulting from the early extinguishment of debt be classified as an extraordinary item in the consolidated statements of earnings 
instead  companies must evaluate whether the transaction meets both the criteria of being unusual in nature and infrequent in occurrence 
other aspects of sfas no 
relating to accounting for intangible assets of motor carriers and accounting for lease modifications do not currently apply to us 
we implemented sfas no 
beginning in the fiscal year ending july   and began reporting expenses associated with early extinguishments of debt in income from continuing operations 
for the year ended july   we recognized million of expenses associated with the early retirement of the million senior secured notes 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
 we would have classified this type of expense as an extraordinary item 
sfas no 
modifies the financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this standard requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
additionally  the statement requires the liability to be recognized and measured initially at fair value 
under previous rules  liabilities for exit costs were recognized at the date of the entity s commitment to an exit plan 
we adopted and implemented sfas no 
for any exit or disposal activities initiated after july  we believe it will not have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
sfas no 
amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation

sfas no 
establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
many of those instruments were previously classified as equity 
this statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective for the fiscal year ending july  we have studied sfas no

fasb financial interpretation no 
expands the existing disclosure requirements for guarantees and requires that companies recognize a liability for guarantees issued after december  we implemented this interpretation beginning in the three months ended january  during the year ended july   the implementation resulted in the recognition of a liability of million  and a related asset of million  both of which will be recognized into income over the life of the guarantees 
see note j guarantees to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion about these guarantees 
fasb financial interpretation no 
clarifies accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements 
if certain conditions are met  this interpretation requires the primary beneficiary to consolidate certain variable interest entities in which equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity investment at risk to permit the variable interest entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
this interpretation is effective immediately for variable interest entities created or obtained after january  for variable interest entities acquired before february   the interpretation is effective for the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  we currently do not have any variable interest entities that would be subject to this interpretation 
emerging issues task force eitf issues involved in accounting for derivative contracts held for trading purposes and contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities eliminates any basis for recognizing physical inventories included in energy trading activities at fair value 
this new accounting rule applies to all physical inventory purchased after october  we had previously recognized physical inventories included in risk management trading activities at fair value 
eitf no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables addresses how to account for arrangements that may involve multiple revenue generating activities  ie  the delivery or performance of multiple products  services  and or rights to use assets 
in applying this guidance  separate contracts with the same party  entered into at or near the same time  will be presumed to be a bundled transaction  and the consideration will be measured and allocated to the separate units based on their relative fair values 
this consensus guidance will be applicable to agreements entered into in quarters beginning after june  we will adopt this new accounting pronouncement beginning august  we believe this pronouncement will not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows  because we do not enter into a significant number of arrangements that may involve multiple revenue generating activities 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles requires us to establish accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate our policies and estimates on an on going basis 
our consolidated financial statements may differ based upon different estimates and assumptions 
we discuss our significant accounting policies in note b summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following are our critical accounting policies depreciation of property  plant and equipment we calculate depreciation using the straight line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from two to years 
changes in the estimated useful lives of our assets could have a material effect on our results of operations 
we do not anticipate future changes in the estimated useful lives of our property  plant and equipment 
amortization of intangible assets we calculate amortization using either straight line or accelerated methods over periods ranging from two to years 
we use amortization methods and determine asset values based on our best estimates using reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections 
changes in the amortization methods or asset values could have a material effect on our results of operations 
we do not anticipate future changes in the estimated useful lives of our intangible assets 
fair value of derivative commodity contracts we enter into commodity forward  futures  swaps and options contracts involving propane and related products  which  in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  are not accounting hedges  but are used for risk management trading purposes 
to the extent such contracts are entered into at fixed prices and thereby subject us to market risk  the contracts are accounted for using the fair value method 
under this valuation method  derivatives are carried in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with changes in value recognized in earnings 
we classify all gains and losses from these derivative contracts entered into for risk management trading purposes as cost of product sold in the consolidated statements of earnings 
we utilize published settlement prices for exchange traded contracts  quotes provided by brokers and estimates of market prices based on daily contract activity to estimate the fair value of these contracts 
changes in the methods used to determine the fair value of these contracts could have a material effect on our results of operations 
for further discussion of derivative commodity contracts  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations  liquidity and capital resources disclosures about risk management activities accounted for at fair value and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and note l derivatives to our consolidated financial statements 
we do not anticipate future changes in the methods used to determine the fair value of these derivative contracts 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our risk management activities primarily attempt to mitigate risks related to the purchasing  storing and transporting of propane 
we generally purchase propane in the contract and spot markets from major domestic energy companies on a short term basis 
our costs to purchase and distribute propane fluctuate with the movement of market prices 
this fluctuation subjects us to potential price risk  which we attempt to minimize through the use of risk management activities 
our risk management trading activities include the use of energy commodity forward contracts  swaps and options traded on the over the counter financial markets and futures and options traded on the new york mercantile exchange 
these risk management activities are conducted primarily to offset the effect of market price fluctuations on propane inventory and purchase commitments and to mitigate the price risk on sale commitments to our customers 
our risk management activities are intended to generate a profit  which we then apply to reduce our cost of product sold 
the results of our risk management activities directly related to the delivery of propane to our retail customers  which include our supply procurement  storage and transportation activities  are presented in our discussion of retail margins and are accounted for at cost 
the results of our other risk management activities are presented separately in our discussion of cost of product sold and gross profit as risk management trading activities and are accounted for at fair value 
market risks associated with energy commodities are monitored daily by senior management for compliance with our commodity risk management policy 
this policy includes an aggregate dollar loss limit and limits on the term of various contracts 
we also utilize volume limits for various energy commodities and review our positions daily where we remain exposed to market risk  so as to manage exposures to changing market prices 
market  credit and liquidity risk 
new york mercantile exchange traded futures and options are guaranteed by the new york mercantile exchange and have nominal credit risk 
we are exposed to credit risk associated with forwards  swaps and option transactions in the event of nonperformance by counterparties 
for each counterparty  we analyze its financial condition prior to entering into an agreement  establish a credit limit and monitor the appropriateness of the limit 
the change in market value of exchange traded futures contracts requires daily cash settlement in margin accounts with brokers 
forwards and most other over the counter instruments are generally settled at the expiration of the contract term 
in order to minimize the liquidity risk of cash  margin or collateral requirements of counterparties for over the counter instruments  we attempt to balance maturities and positions with individual counterparties 
historically  our risk management activities have not experienced significant credit related losses in any year or with any individual counterparty 
our risk management contracts do not contain material repayment provisions related to a decline in our credit rating 
sensitivity analysis 
we prepared a sensitivity analysis to estimate the exposure to market risk of our energy commodity positions 
forward contracts  futures  swaps and options outstanding as of july  and  that were used in our risk management trading activities were analyzed assuming a hypothetical adverse change in prices for the delivery month for all energy commodities 
the potential loss in future earnings regarding these positions from a adverse movement in market prices of the underlying energy commodities was estimated at million and million for risk management trading activities as of july  and  respectively 
the preceding hypothetical analysis is limited because changes in prices may or may not equal  thus actual results may differ 
at july  and  we had million and million  respectively  in variable rate amended bank credit facility borrowings 
thus  assuming a one percent increase in our variable interest rate  our interest rate risk related to the borrowings on the variable rate amended bank credit facility would result in a loss in future earnings of million for fiscal
