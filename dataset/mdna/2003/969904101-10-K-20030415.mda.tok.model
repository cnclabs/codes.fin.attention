dollars in thousands fiscal total fiscal total fiscal total retail sales direct to customer sales shipping fees net revenues net revenues for fiscal increased by  or over fiscal and net revenues for fiscal increased by  or over fiscal the increase in both years was primarily due to the opening of net new stores in fiscal and net new stores in fiscal and the growth of the williams sonoma  pottery barn and pottery barn kids concepts 
during fiscal and  the hold everything brand developed and implemented a brand repositioning strategy in both the retail and direct to customer channels 
as part of this repositioning strategy  sales expectations for the brand were modified to reflect reduced catalog pages and circulation  lowered store counts  and a change in merchandise mix 
during august  we launched a private label credit card program in the pottery barn and pottery barn kids brands 
a third party credit provider administers the program and we bear no credit risk 
the program launch included a first purchase discount and a loyalty rewards program to incentivize our customers to accept the card 
as of february  weeks after the initial launch of the program  approximately  cards had been issued with charges totaling over  in fiscal the promotional expense associated with the first purchase discount and loyalty rewards program is accounted for as a reduction to revenue and totaled  in fiscal

pottery barn and pottery barn kids accounted for of the growth in retail revenues from fiscal to fiscal as part of the hold everything brand repositioning strategy  eleven hold everything stores were closed during fiscal and two stores were closed in fiscal most of these closures were smaller stores in non strategic locations at or near their lease termination date 
in fiscal  we opened our first stores outside the united states 
a total of five stores were opened in the toronto  canada market two williams sonoma stores  two pottery barn stores  and one pottery barn kids store 
in fiscal  we opened an additional three retail stores in toronto one in each brand 
we anticipate opening three more canadian stores in fiscal one pottery barn store and one williams sonoma store in toronto  ontario and one pottery barn store in vancouver  bc retail revenues in fiscal increased by  or over fiscal  principally due to a net increase of stores and a increase in comparable store sales 
pottery barn and pottery barn kids accounted for of the growth in retail revenues from fiscal to fiscal comparable store sales comparable stores are defined as those stores whose gross square feet did not change by more than in the previous months and which have been open for at least consecutive fiscal months without closure for seven or more consecutive days 
comparable store sales are computed based on aggregate sales of comparable stores for the reporting period 
by measuring the year over year sales of merchandise in the stores that have a 
table of contents history of being opened for a full comparable months or more  we can better gauge how the core store base is performing since it excludes store expansions and closings 
percent increase decrease in comparable store sales fiscal fiscal fiscal williams sonoma pottery barn pottery barn kids n a hold everything outlets total comparable store sales in the pottery barn kids concept have fluctuated and are expected to continue to fluctuate in fiscal and fiscal this fluctuation is primarily due to the rapid growth of the retail store base  the initial impact of new store openings on existing comparable stores  strong first year sales in new stores due to grand opening events  and inventory management challenges that resulted from aggressive store opening calendars and better than expected merchandise successes in this recently launched retail concept 
based upon these factors and our experience during the early years of the pottery barn rollout of its design studio stores in the mid s  we expect continued volatility in the pottery barn kids comparable store sales results during fiscal in fiscal  pottery barn kids operated retail stores versus stores in fiscal for the comparable store sales base calculation  stores were included in fiscal and only stores were included in fiscal our current business plan for fiscal is to increase retail leased square footage by approximately to or a net increase of approximately new retail stores consisting of pottery barn kids stores  net pottery barn stores  and net williams sonoma stores  less the closing of hold everything stores in the terminal year of their leases 
direct to customer revenues dollars in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal catalog sales internet sales total direct to customer sales shipping fees total direct to customer revenues percent growth in direct to customer sales percent growth in number of catalogs circulated direct to customer revenues in fiscal increased by  or over fiscal this increase was primarily due to increased catalog circulation  expanded use of e commerce partnerships  and improved productivity of electronic direct marketing techniques in the pottery barn  pottery barn kids and williams sonoma brands 
additionally  the launch of the west elm concept in april provided incremental sales to the direct to customer channel 
hold everything sales declined during fiscal as a result of our brand repositioning activities  which include fewer pages per catalog  lower product density per page  and fewer catalog mailings 
in fiscal  we unveiled our pottery barn kids e commerce website  launched our pottery barn online gift and bridal registry  and introduced our pottery barn kids online gift registry 
in fiscal  we launched our pottery barn e commerce website 
combined revenues includes shipping fees from the four websites were  in fiscal  an increase of  or from  in fiscal although the amount of e commerce sales that are incremental to our direct to customer channel cannot be identified 
table of contents precisely  we estimate that approximately to of non bridal e commerce sales are incremental to the direct to customer channels and approximately to are from mail order customers who would have potentially placed an order via the catalog call center 
direct to customer revenues in fiscal increased by  or over fiscal primarily due to strong growth in the pottery barn  pottery barn kids and williams sonoma concepts which was partially offset by lower sales in hold everything due to a planned reduction in catalog circulation during the development and implementation of our repositioning strategy for hold everything 
cost of goods sold net net net dollars in thousands fiscal revenues fiscal revenues fiscal revenues cost of goods and occupancy expenses shipping costs total cost of goods sold cost of goods and occupancy expenses increased by  in fiscal over fiscal cost of goods and occupancy expenses expressed as a percentage of net revenues for fiscal decreased basis points from fiscal the percentage decrease was primarily driven by several operational improvements including an increase in shipping fees for merchandise delivered to customers  a decrease in cost of merchandise due to improved sourcing efforts  an increase in full price merchandise sales and fewer markdowns  a decrease in customer returns and associated costs  a decrease in inventory shrinkage due to reduced inventory levels and improved accountability through the supply chain  and lower freight costs from the distribution center to the stores 
cost of goods and occupancy expenses increased by  in fiscal over fiscal cost of goods and occupancy expenses expressed as a percentage of net revenues for fiscal decreased basis points from fiscal  principally due to fewer promotional markdowns  aggressive inventory management  increased initial markups and lower freight costs in the retail channels  partially offset by increased occupancy costs 
the increase in occupancy costs was driven primarily by increased depreciation  an increase in the percentage mix of net revenues generated through the retail channel  and increased rent and utility costs 
shipping costs consist of third party delivery services and shipping materials 
shipping costs increased in fiscal and fiscal due to more shipments of products to customers as direct to customer sales increased  and a higher mix of furniture sales 
as a percentage of shipping fees  shipping costs have continued to decline from in fiscal to in fiscal  and to in fiscal due to the negotiation of improved shipping rates that reduced costs per shipment 
in addition  shipping fees increased due to an increase in rates that we charge our customers for shipping and handling 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased by  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal  and as a percent of net revenues  decreased by basis points to in fiscal from in fiscal this percentage decrease was primarily due to a reduction in other general expenses and lower catalog advertising costs  partially offset by higher employment costs 
the reduced catalog advertising costs as a percentage of net revenues was primarily due to an overall reduction in the percentage of total net revenues being generated by the direct to customer channel  higher catalog productivity and lower catalog production costs 
the employment cost increase as a percentage of net revenues was primarily due to increased incentive compensation based on the achievement of corporate profitability targets  an approximate  expense associated with the departure of our former chief executive officer due in large part to the acceleration of vesting on stock options and restricted stock grants  and higher employment costs to support information technology initiatives 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses increased by  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal  and as a percent of net revenues  decreased basis points to in fiscal from in fiscal this percentage decrease was primarily due to reduced catalog advertising costs as a percentage of net revenues due to stronger consumer demand and higher catalog productivity  as well as an improvement in other general expenses  partially offset by higher employment costs 
the fiscal employment cost increase  as a percentage of net revenues  was substantially driven by fiscal performance bonuses and non cash stock based compensation charges 
in fiscal  no performance bonuses or non cash stock based compensation charges were incurred 
interest expense net net interest expense decreased by  to  in fiscal  primarily due to the absence of any borrowings under our revolving line of credit facility in fiscal and an increase in short term investment income 
net interest expense in fiscal decreased by  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  principally due to the decreased balance under our line of credit facility due to continued asset management initiatives including aggressive inventory management programs as well as lower interest rates on our borrowings  offset by a decrease in capitalized interest costs for projects under construction 
income taxes our effective tax rate was for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal liquidity and capital resources in fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities increased by  to  from  in fiscal this increase in operating cash is primarily attributable to higher net earnings and a significant increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities primarily related to growth in merchandise inventories and higher freight payables 
this increase was partially offset by increased merchandise inventory 
merchandise inventory growth of approximately during fiscal is primarily a result of a increase in selling square footage and a management initiative to improve order fulfillment and customer satisfaction 
for fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities increased by  to  from  in fiscal the fiscal increase in operating cash was primarily attributable to higher net earnings  reductions in merchandise inventories and improved cash flow from accounts receivable offset by cash used to reduce accounts payable 
the decrease in accounts payable was primarily due to substantially lower inventories and lower deferred catalog expenses 
the decrease in merchandise inventories was primarily due to aggressive inventory management and improved inventory turns

on march   our board of directors authorized management to obtain information  conduct negotiations  and enter into appropriate agreements with the intent to pursue potential acquisitions of the distribution facilities currently leased from partnerships and prior to the end of fiscal in january  management concluded that the acquisition of such distribution facilities would not be beneficial to us from both an operational and financial standpoint 
therefore  the distribution facilities were not acquired 
in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin no 
explains how to identify variable interest entities and how an enterprise assesses its interests in a variable interest entity to decide whether to consolidate that entity 
fin no 
requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risks among parties involved 
fin no 
is effective immediately for variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
fin no 
applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june   to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  management determined that the partnerships partnerships and from which we leased our memphis distribution facilities  qualify as a variable interest entity under fin no 
due to their related party relationship with us 
therefore  we will be required to consolidate partnerships and as of august   the beginning of the third quarter of fiscal we currently estimate that the consolidation will result in increases of approximately  in assets primarily buildings and  in liabilities primarily long term debt to our consolidated balance sheet and a cumulative effect charge of approximately  after taxes to our statement of earnings as of august  the bonds issued in connection with partnerships and have no recourse to us  and we do not anticipate incurring any loss from our obligations under these leases 
impact of inflation the impact of inflation on results of operations has not been significant 
stock repurchase program from time to time  we have repurchased our common stock on the open market and retired those shares we purchased 
in january  the board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program to acquire up to four million shares of our common stock in the open market 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we repurchased and retired two million shares of our common stock at a total cost of approximately  a weighted average cost of per share 
as of february   the remaining authorized amount of stock eligible for repurchase is two million shares 
the total value of common stock we can repurchase is limited by the debt covenant associated with our credit facilities 
future purchases under this program will be made through open market transactions at times and amounts that management deems appropriate 
the timing and actual number of shares to be purchased in the future will depend on a variety of factors such as price  
table of contents corporate and regulatory requirements  and other market conditions 
we may terminate or limit the stock repurchase program at any time without prior notice 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
the estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an on going basis and are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize sales and the related cost of products at the time the products are received by customers in accordance with the provisions of the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
revenue is recognized for retail sales excluding home delivered merchandise at the point of sale in the store and for home delivered merchandise and direct to customer sales when the merchandise is delivered to the customer 
shipping and handling fees charged to the customer are recognized as revenue at the time the products are received by the customer 
sales return reserve our customers may return purchased items for an exchange or refund 
we record a reserve for estimated product returns based on historical return trends together with current product sales performance 
if actual returns are different than those projected by management  the estimated sales return reserve will be adjusted accordingly 
depreciation and amortization depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
see note a to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding property and equipment 
stock based compensation we account for stock options granted to employees using the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
accordingly  no compensation expense has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements for stock options 
statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  however  requires the disclosure of pro forma net earnings and earnings per share as if we had adopted the fair value method 
under sfas no 
 the fair value of stock based awards to employees is calculated through the use of option pricing models 
these models require subjective assumptions  including future stock price volatility and expected time to exercise  which affect the calculated values 
our calculations are based on a single option valuation approach and forfeitures are recognized as they occur 
during fiscal  we entered into employment agreements with certain executive officers under which we recognized stock based compensation expense ratably over the vesting period 
inventory reserves merchandise inventories  net of an allowance for excess quantities and obsolescence  are stated at the lower of cost weighted average method or market 
we estimate a provision for damaged  obsolete  excess and slow moving inventory based on specific identification and inventory aging reports 
if actual impairment is different than what our estimated provision was based on  we will adjust our provision accordingly 

table of contents catalog amortization prepaid catalog expenses consist of third party incremental direct costs including creative design  paper  printing  postage and mailing costs for all of our direct response catalogs 
such costs are capitalized as prepaid catalog expenses and are amortized over their expected period of future benefit 
such amortization is based upon the ratio of actual revenues to the total of actual and estimated future revenues on an individual catalog basis 
prepaid catalog expenses are evaluated for realizability at each reporting period by comparing the carrying amount associated with each catalog to the estimated probable remaining future net revenues net sales less merchandise cost of goods sold  selling expenses and catalog completion costs associated with that catalog 
if the carrying amount is in excess of the estimated probable remaining future net revenue  the excess is expensed in the reporting period 
self insured liabilities we are primarily self insured for workers compensation  employee health benefits and product and general liability insurance 
we record self insurance liabilities based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported 
should a different amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated or costs of the claims increase or decrease beyond what was anticipated  reserves recorded may not be sufficient and the accruals may need to be adjusted accordingly in future periods 
risk factors the following information describes certain significant risks inherent in our business 
you should carefully consider such risks  together with the other information contained in this annual report on form k and in our other public filings 
if any of such risks and uncertainties actually occurs  our business  financial condition or operating results could differ materially from the plans  projections and other forward looking statements included in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and elsewhere in this report and in our other public filings 
in addition  if any of the following risks and uncertainties  or if any other disclosed risks and uncertainties  actually occurs  our business  financial condition or operating results could be harmed substantially  which  in turn  could cause the market price of our stock to decline  perhaps significantly 
we must successfully anticipate changing consumer preferences and buying trends  and manage our inventory commensurate with customer demand 
our success depends upon our ability to anticipate and respond to changing merchandise trends and customer demands in a timely manner 
consumer preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and may change between sales seasons 
if we misjudge either the market for our merchandise or our customers purchasing habits  our sales may decline significantly and we may be required to mark down certain products to sell the resulting excess inventory or sell such inventory through our outlet stores at prices which are significantly lower than our retail prices  each of which would harm our business and operating results 
in addition  we must manage our inventory effectively and commensurate with customer demand 
much of our inventory is sourced from vendors located outside the united states 
thus  we usually must order merchandise  and enter into contracts for the purchase and manufacture of such merchandise  well in advance of the applicable selling season and frequently before trends are known 
the extended lead times for many of our purchases may make it difficult for us to respond rapidly to new or changing trends 
in addition  the seasonal nature of the specialty home products business requires us to carry a significant amount of inventory prior to peak selling season 
as a result  we are vulnerable to demand and pricing shifts and to misjudgments in the selection and timing of merchandise purchases 
if we do not accurately predict our customers preferences and acceptance levels of our products  our inventory levels will not be appropriate and our business and operating results may be negatively impacted 
our business depends  in part  on factors affecting consumer spending that are out of our control 
our business depends on consumer demand for our products and  consequently  is sensitive to a number of factors that influence consumer spending  including general economic conditions  disposable consumer 
table of contents income  recession and fears of recession  war and fears of war  inclement weather  consumer debt  interest rates  sales tax rates and rate increases  consumer confidence in future economic conditions and political conditions  and consumer perceptions of personal well being and security generally 
adverse changes in factors affecting discretionary consumer spending could reduce consumer demand for our products  thus reducing our sales and harming our business and operating results 
the growth of our sales and profits depends  in large part  on our ability to successfully open new stores 
in each of the past three fiscal years  our retail stores have generated approximately of our net revenues 
we plan a net increase of approximately new retail stores in fiscal as part of our growth strategy 
there is no assurance that this strategy will be successful 
our ability to open additional stores successfully will depend upon a number of factors  including our identification and availability of suitable store locations  our success in negotiating leases on acceptable terms  our ability to secure required governmental permits and approvals  our hiring and training of skilled store operating personnel  especially management  our timely development of new stores  including the availability of construction materials and labor and the absence of significant construction and other delays in store openings  the availability of financing on acceptable terms if at all  and general economic conditions 
many of these factors are beyond our control 
for example  for the purpose of identifying suitable store locations  we rely  in part  on demographics surveys regarding location of consumers in our target market segments 
while we believe that the surveys and other relevant information are helpful indicators of suitable store locations  we recognize that the information sources cannot predict future consumer preferences and buying trends with complete accuracy 
in addition  time frames for lease negotiations and store development vary from location to location and can be subject to unforeseen delays 
construction and other delays in store openings could have a negative impact on our business and operating results 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to open new stores or that  if opened  those stores will be operated profitably 
we face intense competition from companies with brands or products similar to ours 
the specialty retail and direct to customer business is highly competitive 
our specialty retail stores  mail order catalogs and internet websites compete with other retail stores  other mail order catalogs and other e commerce websites that market lines of merchandise similar to ours 
we compete with national  regional and local businesses utilizing a similar retail store strategy  as well as traditional furniture stores  department stores and specialty stores 
the substantial sales growth in the direct to customer industry within the last decade has encouraged the entry of many new competitors and an increase in competition from established companies 
the competitive challenges facing us include  without limitation anticipating and quickly responding to changing consumer demands better than our competitors  maintaining favorable brand recognition and achieving customer perception of value  effectively marketing and competitively pricing our products to consumers in several diverse market segments  and developing innovative  high quality products in colors and styles that appeal to consumers of varying age groups and tastes  and in ways that favorably distinguish us from our competitors 
in light of the many competitive challenges facing us  there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully 
increased competition could adversely affect our sales  operating results and business 

table of contents we depend on key domestic and foreign vendors for timely and effective sourcing of our merchandise  and we are subject to various risks and uncertainties that might affect our vendors ability to produce quality merchandise 
our performance depends on our ability to purchase our merchandise in sufficient quantities at competitive prices 
we purchase our merchandise from numerous foreign and domestic manufacturers and importers 
we have no contractual assurances of continued supply  pricing or access to new products  and any vendor could discontinue selling to us at any time 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to acquire desired merchandise in sufficient quantities on terms acceptable to us in the future 
any inability to acquire suitable merchandise or the loss of one or more key vendors could have a negative effect on our business and operating results because we would be missing products that we felt were important to our assortment  unless and until alternative supply arrangements are secured 
we may not be able to develop relationships with new vendors  and products from alternative sources  if any  may be of a lesser quality and or more expensive than those we currently purchase 
in addition  we are subject to certain risks  including availability of raw materials  labor disputes  union organizing activity  inclement weather  natural disasters  and general economic and political conditions  that might limit our vendors ability to provide us with quality merchandise on a timely basis 
for these or other reasons  one or more of our vendors might not adhere to our quality control standards  and we might not identify the deficiency before merchandise ships to our stores or customers 
our vendors failure to manufacture or import quality merchandise in a timely and effective manner could damage our reputation and brands  and could lead to an increase in customer litigation against us and attendant increase in our routine litigation costs 
our dependence on foreign vendors subjects us to a variety of risks and uncertainties 
we source our products from manufacturers in over countries 
specifically  in fiscal  approximately of our merchandise purchases were foreign sourced  primarily from asia and europe 
our dependence on foreign vendors means  in part  that we may be affected by declines in the relative value of the us dollar to other foreign currencies 
although substantially all of our foreign purchases of merchandise are negotiated and paid for in us dollars  declines in foreign currencies and currency exchange rates might negatively affect the profitability and business prospects of one or more of our foreign vendors 
this  in turn  might cause such foreign vendors to demand higher prices for merchandise  hold up merchandise shipments to us  or discontinue selling to us  any of which could ultimately reduce our sales or increase our costs 
we are also subject to other risks and uncertainties associated with changing economic and political conditions in foreign countries 
these risks and uncertainties include import duties and quotas  work stoppages  economic uncertainties including inflation  foreign government regulations  wars and fears of war  political unrest and trade restrictions 
we cannot predict whether any of the countries in which our products are currently manufactured or may be manufactured in the future will be subject to trade restrictions imposed by the us or foreign governments or the likelihood  type or effect of any such restrictions 
any event causing a disruption or delay of imports from foreign vendors  including the imposition of additional import restrictions  restrictions on the transfer of funds and or increased tariffs or quotas  or both  against home centered items could increase the cost or reduce the supply of merchandise available to us and adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
furthermore  some or all of our foreign vendors operations may be adversely affected by political and financial instability resulting in the disruption of trade from exporting countries  restrictions on the transfer of funds and or other trade disruptions 
in addition  although we are in the process of developing and implementing an enhanced global compliance program  there remains a risk that one or more of our foreign vendors will not adhere to our global compliance standards including  eg  fair labor standards and the prohibition on child labor 
if this happens  we could lose customer goodwill and favorable brand recognition  which could negatively affect our business and operating results 

table of contents we must timely and effectively deliver merchandise to our stores and customers 
we cannot control all of the various factors that might affect our fulfillment rates in direct to customer sales and or timely and effective merchandise delivery to our stores 
we rely upon third party carriers for our merchandise shipments  including shipments to our customers and to and from all of our stores 
accordingly  we are subject to the risks  including labor disputes eg  west coast port strike of  union organizing activity  inclement weather  natural disasters  and possible acts of terrorism associated with such carriers ability to provide delivery services to meet our shipping needs 
failure to deliver merchandise in a timely and effective manner could damage our reputation and brands 
in addition  we are seeing fuel costs increase substantially and airline companies struggle to operate profitably  which could lead to increased fulfillment expenses and negatively affect our business and operating results by increasing costs and negatively affecting the efficiency of our shipments 
our failure to successfully manage our order taking and fulfillment operations might have a negative impact on our business 
the operation of our direct to customer business depends on our ability to maintain the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our order taking and fulfillment operations and our e commerce websites 
disruptions or slowdowns in these areas could result from disruptions in telephone service or power outages  inadequate system capacity  human error  natural disasters or adverse weather conditions 
these problems could result in a reduction in sales as well as increased selling  general and administrative expenses 
in addition  we face the risk that we cannot hire enough qualified employees  especially during our peak season  to support our direct to customer operations  due to war or other circumstances that reduce the relevant workforce 
the need to operate with fewer employees could negatively impact our customer service levels and our operations 
we experience fluctuations in our comparable store sales 
our success depends  in part  upon our ability to increase sales at our existing stores 
various factors affect comparable store sales  including the number of stores we open  close and expand in any period  the general retail sales environment  changes in sales mix between distribution channels  our ability to efficiently source and distribute products  changes in our merchandise mix  competition  current economic conditions  the timing of release of new merchandise and promotional events  the success of marketing programs  and cannibalization of existing store sales by new stores 
among other things  weather conditions can affect comparable store sales  because inclement weather can require us to close certain stores temporarily and thus reduce store traffic 
even if stores are not closed  many customers may decide to avoid going to stores in bad weather 
these factors may cause our comparable store sales results to differ materially from prior periods and from earnings guidance we have provided 
our comparable store sales have fluctuated significantly in the past on an annual  quarterly and monthly basis  and we expect that comparable store sales will continue to fluctuate in the future 
our comparable store sales increases for fiscal years  and were  and  respectively 
past comparable store sales are no indication of future results  and there can be no assurance that our comparable store sales will not decrease in the future 
our ability to maintain and improve our comparable store sales results depends in large part on maintaining and improving our forecasting of customer demand and buying trends  selecting effective marketing techniques  providing an appropriate mix of merchandise for our broad and diverse customer base and using more effective pricing strategies 
any failure to meet the comparable store sales expectations of investors and security analysts in one or more future periods could significantly reduce the market price of our common stock 
our failure to successfully manage the costs and performance of our catalog mailings might have a negative impact on our business 
postal rate increases and paper and printing costs affect the cost of our catalog mailings 
we rely on discounts from the basic postal rate structure  such as discounts for bulk mailings and sorting by zip code and carrier routes 
our cost of paper has fluctuated significantly during the past three fiscal years  and our paper costs may 
table of contents increase in the future 
although we have entered into long term contracts for catalog paper and catalog printing  these contracts offer no assurance that our catalog production costs will not substantially increase following expiration of the contracts 
future increases in postal rates or paper or printing costs would have a negative impact on our operating results to the extent that we are unable to pass such increases on directly to customers or offset such increases by raising selling prices or by implementing more efficient printing  mailing  delivery and order fulfillment systems 
we have historically experienced fluctuations in customer response to our catalogs 
customer response to our catalogs is substantially dependent on merchandise assortment  merchandise availability and creative presentation  as well as the sizing and timing of delivery of the catalogs 
the failure to effectively produce or distribute the catalogs could affect the timing of catalog delivery  which could cause customers to forego or defer purchases 
we must successfully manage our internet business 
the success of our e commerce business depends  in part  on factors over which we have limited control 
in addition to changing consumer preferences and buying trends relating to internet usage  we are vulnerable to certain additional risks and uncertainties associated with the internet  including changes in required technology interfaces  website downtime and other technical failures  changes in applicable federal and state regulation  security breaches  and consumer privacy concerns 
our failure to successfully respond to these risks and uncertainties might adversely affect the sales through our e commerce business  as well as damage our reputation and brands 
we must successfully manage the complexities associated with a multi channel and multi brand business 
during the past few years  with the launch and expansion of our e commerce business  new brands and brand expansions  our overall business has become substantially more complex 
the changes in our business have forced us to develop new expertise and face new challenges  risks and uncertainties 
for example  we face the risk that our e commerce business might cannibalize a significant portion of our retail and catalog businesses 
while we recognize that our e commerce sales cannot be entirely incremental to sales through our retail and catalog channels  we seek to attract as many new customers as possible to our websites 
we continually analyze the business results of our three channels and the relationships among the channels  in an effort to find opportunities to build incremental sales 
however  we cannot ensure that  as our e commerce business grows  it will not cannibalize a portion of our retail and catalog businesses 
we have recently introduced a new brand  west elm  and may introduce additional new brands and brand extensions in the future 
our introduction of new brands and brand extensions poses another set of risks 
if we devote time and resources to new brands and brand extensions  and those businesses are not as successful as we planned  then we risk damaging our overall business results 
alternatively  if our new brands and brand extensions prove to be very successful  we risk hurting our existing brands through the migration of customers to the new businesses 
there can be no assurance that we can and will introduce new brands and brand extensions that improve our overall business and operating results 
our inability to obtain commercial insurance at acceptable prices might have a negative impact on our business 
during fiscal  there was a substantial increase in the costs of insurance  partly in response to the terrorist attacks of september   and financial irregularities and other fraud at publicly traded companies 
we believe that extensive commercial insurance coverage is prudent for risk management and anticipate that our insurance costs will increase substantially 
in addition  for certain types or levels of risk eg  risks associated with earthquakes or terrorist attacks  we might determine that we cannot obtain commercial insurance at acceptable prices 
therefore  we might choose to forego or limit our purchase of relevant commercial insurance  choosing instead to self insure one or more types or levels of risks 
if we suffer a substantial loss that is not covered by commercial insurance  the loss and attendant expenses could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 

table of contents our inability or failure to protect our intellectual property would have a negative impact on our business 
our trademarks  service marks  copyrights  patents  trade dress rights  trade secrets  domain names and other intellectual property are valuable assets that are critical to our success 
the unauthorized reproduction or other misappropriation of our intellectual property could diminish the value of our brands or goodwill and cause a decline in our sales 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately protect our intellectual property or that the costs of defending our intellectual property will not adversely affect our operating results 
we have been sued and may be named in additional lawsuits in a growing number of industry wide patent litigation cases relating to the internet 
there appears to be a growing number of patent infringement lawsuits instituted against companies such as ours that have an e commerce business 
the plaintiff in each case claims to hold a patent that covers web technology  which is allegedly infringed by the operation of the defendants websites 
we are currently a defendant in certain such patent infringement cases and anticipate being named in others in the future  as part of an industry wide trend 
even in cases where a plaintiff s claim lacks merit  the defense costs in a patent infringement case are very high 
there can be no assurance that additional patent infringement claims will not be brought against us  or that the cost of defending such claims or the ultimate resolution of such claims will not negatively impact our business and operating results 
we are planning certain systems changes that might disrupt our supply chain operations 
our success depends on our ability to source merchandise efficiently through appropriate systems and procedures 
we are in the process of substantially modifying our information technology systems supporting the product pipeline  including design  sourcing  merchandise planning  forecasting and purchase order  inventory  distribution  transportation and price management 
modifications will involve updating or replacing legacy systems with successor systems during the course of several years 
there are inherent risks associated with replacing our core systems  including supply chain disruptions that affect our ability to get products into our stores and delivered to customers 
there can be no assurance that we will successfully launch these new systems or that the launch will occur without supply chain disruptions 
any resulting supply chain disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
we need to manage our employment  occupancy and other operating costs 
to be successful  we need to manage our operating costs while we continue to look for opportunities to reduce costs 
we recognize that we may need to increase the number of our employees  especially in peak sales seasons  and incur other expenses to support new brands and brand extensions  as well as the opening of new stores and direct to customer growth of our existing brands 
in addition  although we strive to secure long term contracts with our service providers and other vendors and otherwise limit our financial commitment to them  there can be no assurance that we will avoid unexpected operating cost increases in the future 
lower than expected sales  coupled with higher than expected costs  would negatively impact our business and operating results 
we depend on external funding sources for operating funds 
we regularly review and evaluate our liquidity and capital needs 
we currently believe that our available cash  cash equivalents  cash flow from operations and cash available under our existing credit facilities will be sufficient to finance our operations and expected capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  as we continue to grow  we might experience peak periods for our cash needs during the course of our fiscal year  and we might need additional external funding to support our operations 
although we believe we would have access to additional debt and or capital market funding if needed  there can be no assurance that such funds will be available to us on acceptable terms 
if the cost of such funds is greater than expected  it could adversely affect our expenses and our operating results 

table of contents our operating and financial performance in any given period might not meet the extensive guidance that we have provided to the public 
we provide extensive public guidance on our expected operating and financial results for future periods 
although we believe that this guidance fosters confidence among investors and analysts  and is useful to our shareholders and potential shareholders  such guidance is comprised of forward looking statements subject to the risks and uncertainties described in this report and in our other public filings and public statements 
we cannot ensure that our guidance will always be accurate 
if in the future our operating or financial results for a particular period do not meet our guidance or the expectations of investment analysts  the market price of our common stock could decline 
our quarterly results of operations might fluctuate due to a variety of factors including seasonality 
our quarterly results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future  depending upon a variety of factors  including  but not limited to shifts in the timing of holiday selling seasons  including valentine s day  easter  halloween  thanksgiving and christmas  and the strategic importance of fourth quarter results 
a significant portion of our revenues and net earnings have been realized during the period from october through december 
in anticipation of increased holiday sales activity  we incur certain significant incremental expenses  including the hiring of a substantial number of temporary employees to supplement our existing workforce 
if  for any reason  we were to realize significantly lower than expected revenues or net earnings during the october through december selling season  our business and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
our failure to successfully anticipate merchandise returns might have a negative impact on our business 
we record a reserve for merchandise returns based on historical return trends together with current product sales performance in each reporting period 
if actual returns are greater than those projected by management  additional sales returns might be recorded in the future 
there can be no assurance that actual merchandise returns will not exceed our reserves 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the introduction of new merchandise  changes in merchandise mix  changes in consumer confidence  or other competitive and general economic conditions will not cause actual returns to exceed merchandise return reserves 
any significant increase in merchandise returns that exceed our reserves could materially affect our business and results of operations 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks  which include changes in us interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
we do not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate risk the interest payable on our bank line of credit and on two of our operating leases is based on variable interest rates and therefore affected by changes in market interest rates 
if interest rates on existing variable rate debt and operating leases rose basis points an approximately increase in the associated variable rates as of february   our results from operations and cash flows would not be materially affected 
for one of the operating leases with a variable interest rate  we have an interest rate cap contract at with a notional amount of  which extends through february the contract has not been designated as a hedge and is accounted for by adjusting the carrying amount of the contract to market 
a loss of approximately  and  was recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
in addition  we have fixed and variable income investments consisting of cash equivalents and short term investments  which are also affected by changes in market interest rates 
an increase in interest rates of would have an immaterial effect on the value of these investments 
declines in interest rates would  however  decrease the income derived from these investments 
foreign currency risks we purchase a significant amount of inventory from vendors outside of the us in transactions that are primarily us dollar transactions 
a small percentage of our international purchase transactions are in currencies other than the us dollar 
any currency risks related to these transactions are immaterial to the company 
a decline in the relative value of the us dollar to other foreign currencies could  however  lead to increased purchasing costs 
as of february   we have eight retail stores in toronto  canada and expect to open three additional canadian stores in fiscal  which expose us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
due to our operations in canada and the volatility of the canadian dollar  we entered into day forward contracts in order to limit the currency exposure associated with intercompany asset and liability accounts of our canadian subsidiary 
we recorded a loss of approximately  and  in selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal and fiscal  respectively
