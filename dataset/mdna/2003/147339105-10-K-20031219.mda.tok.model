item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is management s assessment of the company s financial condition and a discussion of the principal factors that affect consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the fiscal years ended september    and references herein to   and refer to these fiscal years 
critical accounting policies the company s financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
in following gaap  management exercises judgment in selection and application of accounting principles 
management considers critical accounting policies to be those where different assumptions regarding application could result in material differences in financial statements 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the company has used estimates in measuring certain deferred charges and deferred credits related to items subject to approval of the wutc and the opuc 
estimates are also used in the development of discount rates and trend rates related to the measurement of retirement benefit obligations and accrual amounts  allowances for doubtful accounts  unbilled revenue  valuation of derivative instruments  and in the determination of depreciable lives of utility plant 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates the estimates used  based on historical experience  current conditions and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition the company recognizes operating revenues based on deliveries of gas and other services to customers 
this includes estimated revenues for gas delivered but not billed to residential and commercial customers from the latest meter reading date to the end of the accounting period 
regulatory accounting the company s accounting policies and practices are generally the same as used by unregulated companies for financial reporting under gaap 
however  statement of financial accounting standards fas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  requires regulated companies to apply special accounting treatment to reflect the financial impact of regulation 
for example  in establishing the rates to be charged to the company s retail customers  the washington utilities and transportation commission wutc and the oregon public utility commission opuc may not allow the company to charge its customers for recovery of certain expenses in the same period they are incurred 
instead  rates are established in the future to recover costs that were incurred in a prior period 
in this situation  fas no 
requires the company to defer these costs and include them as regulatory assets on the balance sheet 
in the subsequent period when these costs are recovered from customers  the company then amortizes these costs as expense in the income statement  in an amount equivalent to the amounts recovered 
similarly  certain revenue items  or cost reductions may be deferred as regulatory liabilities  which are later amortized to the income statement as customer rates are reduced 
in order to apply the provisions of fas no 
 the following conditions must apply an independent regulator approves the company s customer rates 
the rates are designed to recover the company s costs of providing the regulated services or products 
there is sufficient demand for the regulated service to reasonably assure that rates can be set at a level to recover the costs 
the company periodically assesses whether conditions merit the continued applicability of fas no 
in the event the company should determine in the future that all or a portion of its regulatory assets and liabilities no longer meet the above criteria  it would be required to write off the related balances of its regulatory assets and liabilities  and reflect the write off in its income statement 
at september  there were  of regulatory assets and  of regulatory liabilities 
pension plans the company has a defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees over years of age with one year of service 
the company also provides executive officers with supplemental retirement  death and disability benefits 
descriptions of these plans  including plan changes adopted in  are included in note to the consolidated financial statements  as well as in item under employee benefits plan changes 
the company s pension costs for these plans are affected by the amount of cash contributions to the plans  the return on plan assets  and by employee demographics  including age  compensation  and length of service 
actuarial formulas are used in the determination of pension costs  and are affected by actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience 
key actuarial assumptions include the expected return on plan assets  the discount rate used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension costs  and the assumed rate of increase in employee compensation 
changes in these assumptions may significantly affect pension costs 
changes to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future pension costs 
changes in pension plan obligations resulting from these factors may not be immediately recognized as pension costs  but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of pension plan participants 
the company s funding policy is to contribute amounts equal to or greater than the minimum amounts required to be funded under the employee retirement income security act  and not more than the maximum amounts currently deductible for income tax purposes 
the company contributed  in and  in to the pension and supplemental executive retirement plans  and expects to contribute  in in selecting a discount rate  the company uses the average of the year and above aaa  aa  a  and baa rates published by moody s 
these are rates considered to be consistent with the expected term of pension benefits 
in the company reduced the discount rate from to in connection with remeasurement of the pension obligation at may   with a further reduction to at september  a reduction in the discount rate results in increases in projected benefit obligation  pension liability  and pension costs 
in selecting an assumed long term rate of return on plan assets  the company considers past performance and economic forecasts for the types of investments held by the plan 
in and the company s assumed rate of return on plan assets was 
a reduction in the assumed rate of return would result in increases in pension liability and pension costs 
the general downward trend in equity markets in and and a partial recovery in have affected the value of the company s plan assets 
additional information regarding the impact of these market declines is included in item under other comprehensive income loss  and in note to the consolidated financial statements 
derivatives the company accounts for derivative transactions according to the provisions of fas no 
 as amended by fas no 
and by fas no 
these standards require that the fair value of all derivative financial instruments be recognized as either assets or liabilities on the company s balance sheet and the recognition of unrealized gains and losses 
the company s contracts for purchase and sale of natural gas qualify for the normal purchase and normal sales exceptions under fas no 
and are not required to be recorded as derivative assets and liabilities 
accordingly  the company recognizes revenues and expenses on an accrual basis  based on physical delivery of natural gas 
the company applies mark to market accounting to financial derivative contracts 
periodic changes in fair market value are recognized in earnings 
the differences in accounting for purchases and sales contracts versus financial contracts do not change the underlying economics of the transactions  but could result in increased quarterly earnings volatility 
new accounting standards see note to the consolidated financial statements 
earnings per share net income for was  compared to  for basic and diluted earnings per share for were  a decrease from the per share earnings for versus net income was  for  compared to  for basic and diluted earnings per share for were  a decrease from the reported for operating margin operating margins by customer category for the fiscal years ended september   and are set forth in the tables below residential and commercial margin months ended september in thousands degree days average number of customers residential commercial average therm usage per customer residential commercial operating margin residential commercial industrial and other margin months ended september and therms in thousands average number of customers electric generation industrial therms delivered electric generation industrial operating margin electric generation industrial gas management services other versus total operating margin of  was only slightly greater than prior year margin of  declines in margins from residential and commercial customers were substantially offset by improvements in margins from industrial and other customers 
residential and commercial 
margins from residential and commercial customers declined  weather  warmer in compared to  contributed to declines in per customer gas consumption 
the resulting impact on margin was a reduction of approximately  partially offsetting this decline was a positive impact from the addition of new customers  which contributed approximately  margin 
industrial and other 
margins from delivery of gas to electric generation customers declined  lower margins from electric generation customers in reflect continued sluggish economic conditions and adequate supplies of lower cost hydropower displacing electricity from gas generation facilities 
margins from delivering gas to industrial customers increased slightly  substantially offsetting the decline from electric generation customers 
margins from gas management services to customers were negatively affected in both years by termination charges in settlement of two cancelled gas supply contracts 
the contracts were entered into to provide supplies to a group of industrial customers who had contracted for gas management services 
in an initial charge of  was recorded reflecting management s estimate at that time of the estimated liability under the claims 
an additional charge of  was recorded in reflecting full settlement of all claims related to these contracts 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company entered into cap and swap derivative arrangements  effectively fixing the price for supplies to be purchased for delivery to gas management customers beginning in as prescribed in fas no 
 the company applies mark to market accounting to these derivatives 
after entering into the derivative arrangements  the market price of gas declined  resulting in a mark to market charge of  reflected in gas management margins 
a significant portion of gas management service margins is derived from arranging gas supplies for these customers 
as these arrangements expire and new ones are entered into  margins will fluctuate 
other margins declined  in other margins included a charge of  related to an estimated liability under an earnings sharing requirement of the oregon public utilities commission 
under that arrangement  the company is required to defer  for refund to oregon customers  of amounts determined under a prescribed formula to be in excess of authorized earnings attributable to regulated operations in that state 
in  other margins included  of revenue from an off system interstate pipeline transaction entered into in versus operating margins in were  a decline of  from  with  of the decline attributed to revenue in from the sale of off system interstate pipeline capacity  and another  contract termination charge recorded in other components of changes in operating margin are described in the paragraphs below 
residential and commercial 
operating margins from residential and commercial customers were essentially even with fiscal year increases in the number of residential and commercial customers contributed approximately  of new margin 
temperatures  warmer than  contributed to a consumption decline  the effect of which substantially offset the improvement from new customer additions 
industrial and other 
operating margins from electric generation customers were  lower than fiscal year the slow economy  mild temperatures  and higher than normal hydroelectric generation dramatically affected demand for gas fired generation throughout the year but particularly during the third and fourth quarters 
the fourth quarter alone was down  from the prior year 
margins in from providing gas management services to customers were negatively affected by a charge related to settlement of termination charges related to cancellation of a gas supply contract 
the contract had been entered into to provide supplies to a group of industrial customers who had contracted for gas management services 
in a charge of  was recorded reflecting management s estimate at that time of the estimated liability under the claim 
other margins declined  from  largely related to opportunities in to enter into two off system interstate pipeline transactions 
these transactions resulted in  of operating margin in  and  in the company has no expectation of additional revenues from such sources  and this is not an on going part of cascade s business 
cost of operations cost of operations  which consists of operating expenses  depreciation and amortization  and property and payroll taxes  was   and  for the fiscal years ended september    and  respectively 
versus operating expenses increased  over  including an increase in employee benefits expenses of  included in benefits expense was recognition of a  curtailment loss in connection with changes in the company s retirement plans for salaried employees and executives 
the revisions to the defined benefit plans constitute plan curtailments under fas no 
 employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefit  resulting in the above mentioned curtailment loss associated with unrecognized prior service cost and transition obligation 
further information on benefits plan changes is included below under employee benefits plan changes 
also contributing to the increase in operating expenses is a  charge for accrual of severance costs  and a  increase in purchased services  stemming primarily from consulting charges related to two projects  the company s review of its benefit plans  and a project to prepare the company for the compliance requirements of the sarbanes oxley act 
depreciation and amortization increased   over primarily as a result of increases in depreciable gas distribution system assets 
property and miscellaneous taxes increased  over related to increases in taxable property 
versus operating expenses for increased  or from employee benefits expense increased  over the bulk of the increase is due to increasing costs of the company s medical benefit plans for active and retired employees 
in the aggregate  other expense categories decreased  due primarily to the inclusion in of  related to the installation of a new integrated work management system 
also included in operating expenses is a  charge for the settlement of a lawsuit filed against the company in in connection with personal injury claims 
depreciation and amortization for increased  or over the increase is primarily attributable to the depreciation on computer system investments in fiscal and natural gas distribution assets added since the previous year 
fiscal was the first full year of depreciation on the integrated work management system installed at the end of property and miscellaneous taxes for increased  or over related to increases in taxable property 
employee benefits plan changes the company has conducted a comprehensive review of its employee benefits plans  and in the third quarter of fiscal began to implement significant changes to its employee retirement plan  executive retirement plan and healthcare plans for both active employees and retirees 
the changes apply to the company s non bargaining unit employees  and are designed to reduce benefits costs by an estimated to million per year  beginning in fiscal the changes are also designed to reduce future volatility in benefits expenses and facilitate management control over future cost increases  while retaining a benefits package management believes is competitive 
though some cost reductions occurred in fiscal  these reductions were offset by costs of implementing the changes  including the charge described below 
some of the changes involve the company s employee retirement plan and executive supplemental retirement plan 
as of september  these defined benefit plans stopped accruing additional benefits 
instead  defined contribution plans will be used for benefits earned beginning october  the revisions to the defined benefit plans constitute plan curtailments under fas no 
 employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits 
therefore  the company recorded a charge to operating expense of approximately  in the third quarter of fiscal  as a curtailment loss associated with unrecognized prior service cost and transition obligation 
nonoperating expense income versus net non operating expense income decreased slightly from  primarily due to a  increase in interest charged to construction 
versus interest expense in  net of interest capitalized  increased  from  due to the issuance of  year notes in november of interest on these notes exceeded interest on the short term debt they replaced 
income taxes the changes in the provision for income taxes from to  and from to are directly attributable to the changes in pre tax earnings 
other comprehensive income loss during fiscal years and  the value of the pension plan assets declined  reflecting the general downward trend in common stock values 
asset values recovered somewhat in the and declines in asset values  along with a decrease in the assumed discount rate to in from in  and a reduction in the earnings assumption rate to in and from the rate  resulted in an unfunded accumulated benefit obligation 
to recognize this liability  the company recorded charges to other comprehensive income loss for minimum pension liability adjustments of  in   in  and  in  in accordance with the provisions of fas no 
other comprehensive loss also includes credits for the deferred income tax effect of   and  for  and respectively 
liquidity and capital resources the seasonal nature of the company s business creates short term cash requirements to finance customer accounts receivable and construction expenditures 
to provide working capital for these requirements  the company has a  bank revolving credit commitment 
this agreement has an annual commitment fee  and a term that expires in november the company also has a  uncommitted bank credit line 
as of september   there was  outstanding debt under these credit lines 
to provide longer term financing  the company in filed an omnibus registration statement under the securities act of providing the ability to issue up to  of new debt and equity securities 
in fiscal the company issued  of year debt under the omnibus registration statement  leaving  available under that registration statement for future financing 
the proceeds of the  offering were used to pay down outstanding short term debt 
because of the availability of short term credit and the ability to issue long term debt and additional equity  management believes it has adequate financial flexibility to meet its anticipated cash needs 
operating activities for fiscal  operating activities provided cash of  substantially equivalent to the  for included in these amounts were  and  for amortization of deferred gas cost changes 
this is primarily related to inclusion in customer rates of a component to recover under recovered gas cost from the winter of fiscal in fiscal the wutc approved this temporary rate increase designed to recover the under recovery by october investing activities cash used by investing activities in was  compared to  in investing activities are substantially all capital expenditures  and included  for a project to automate meter reading amr 
approximately  of capital expenditures were dedicated to connecting new customers 
budgeted capital expenditures for fiscal are approximately  which includes  for the amr project  with the remainder for new customer connections  distribution system reinforcement and replacement projects  equipment  facilities upgrades  and various technology projects 
the amr project is planned to be completed in the first quarter of fiscal  resulting in savings in meter reading expenses when fully phased in by the second quarter of financing activities financing activities for used cash of  compared to  for other than the payment of dividends  the primary financing activity in was the  net increase in short term debt 
the company also received  from the issuance of new common stock 
in  the company began issuing new stock to its dividend reinvestment plan and k plans  and on exercise of stock options 
the prior practice was to use funds received to purchase shares of stock on the open market 
in the primary financing activity was the replacement of  short term debt with proceeds from issuance of new year notes 
environmental matters in  the company received a claim from a property owner in eugene  oregon requesting that the company assume responsibility for investigation and possible clean up of alleged contamination on property previously owned by a predecessor of cascade 
the predecessor company conducted a manufactured gas business on the property from approximately to manufactured gas operations apparently were conducted on the site by several operators beginning about the site was used for other purposes beginning in the present owner has retained an environmental consultant  who is investigating possible contamination on the property 
to date the consultant has reported that it believes contamination is present 
the contamination is consistent with that which might originate from a manufactured gas operation 
there have been no estimates as to possible clean up costs 
the consultant s initial report has been furnished to the oregon department of environmental quality deq 
the owner has reached an intergovernmental agreement with the deq with respect to further investigation and possible remediation of contamination on the property under the voluntary cleanup program 
another northwest utility  which purchased the property from cascade in  has declined to participate in the site investigation  although it may  as a one time owner of the property  bear some share of the responsibility as well 
the company has notified its insurance carriers of the claim and is keeping them advised as to the investigation 
on one occasion in the past when hazardous materials on property formerly owned by a predecessor of the company required clean up  the opuc allowed the clean up costs to be passed on to customers 
in the event the company is responsible for clean up costs not covered by insurance  management anticipates asking for reimbursement through rates for such costs 
in  a property owner in washington notified the company that there is contamination on his property  and that he believes it comes from a former manufactured gas site  owned at one time by a predecessor company  which was merged with cascade in the state of washington department of ecology has categorized this site as a listed site ranked in its most hazardous category 
as a former owner of the site  the company may be strictly liable to the state of washington for investigation and remediation of the contamination of the site  but may share that cost or allocate all the cost to others who actually caused or contributed to the contamination 
the company retained an environmental consultant who conducted a preliminary investigation of possible contamination at the site 
there is evidence of contamination at the site  and there is also evidence of an oil line across the site property owned and operated by others  which may be a contributor to the contamination 
there have been no estimates as to possible clean up costs 
the company has investigated title and other government records to identify other potentially liable parties 
the company has notified the other identified parties of the contamination claims  and has requested cooperation and financial contribution 
in the event the company is responsible for clean up costs not covered by insurance  management anticipates asking the wutc for reimbursement for such costs  through rates charged to customers
