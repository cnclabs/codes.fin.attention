item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we recommend that this discussion and analysis be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto  which are included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of forward looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
these include  but are not limited to operating results  new product introductions and sales  competitive conditions  capital expenditures and resources  manufacturing capacity utilization  customer demand and inventory levels  intellectual property issues  and the risk factors set forth in the section factors affecting future results 
as a result of these risks and uncertainties  actual results could differ from those anticipated in the forward looking statements 
unless otherwise required by law  we undertake no obligation to publicly revise these statements for future events or new information after the date of this annual report on form k 
forward looking statements  which are generally identified by words such as anticipates  expects  plans  and similar terms  include statements related to revenues and gross profit  restructuring and asset impairment charges  research and development activities  selling  general  and administrative expenses  intangible expenses  interest income and other  taxes  capital spending and financing transactions  as well as statements regarding successful development and market acceptance of new products  industry and overall economic conditions and demand  and capacity utilization 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of such statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements 
our estimates are based on historical experience and other assumptions that we consider to be appropriate in the circumstances 
however  actual future results may vary from our estimates 
we believe that the following accounting policies are critical as defined by the securities and exchange commission  in that they are both highly important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results  and require difficult management judgments and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain 
we also have other important policies  including those related to revenue recognition and concentration of credit risk  as discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  which are included in this annual report 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes under an asset and liability approach that requires the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between book and tax bases of assets and liabilities be recognized as deferred tax assets and liabilities 
generally accepted accounting principles require us to evaluate the realizability of our net deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the net deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized 
accordingly  we consider various tax planning strategies  forecasts of future taxable income and our most recent operating results in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
in the consideration of the realizability of net deferred tax assets  recent losses must be given substantially more weight than any projections of future profitability 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we determined that  under applicable accounting principles  it was more likely than not that we would not realize any value for any of our net deferred tax assets 
accordingly  we established a valuation allowance equal to of the amount of these assets 
inventories 
inventories are recorded at the lower of standard cost which generally approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis or market value 
among other reserves  we record reserves for obsolete and excess inventory based on our forecasts of demand over specific future time horizons 
actual market conditions and demand levels in the volatile semiconductor markets that we serve may vary from our forecasts  potentially impacting our inventory reserves and resulting in material effects on our gross margin 
valuation of long lived assets and goodwill 
we own and operate our own manufacturing facilities  as described in part i of this annual report  and have also acquired businesses in recent years 
as a result we have significant property  plant and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets 
we evaluate these items for impairment on an annual basis  or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying values may not be recoverable 
triggering events for impairment reviews may include adverse industry or economic trends  restructuring actions  lowered projections of profitability  or a sustained decline in our market capitalization 
evaluations of possible impairment and  if applicable  adjustments to carrying values  require us to estimate  among other factors  future cash flows  useful lives and fair market values of our reporting units and assets 
actual results may vary from our expectations 
we recorded asset impairment charges of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
in connection with our adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we completed a transitional goodwill impairment review as of the beginning of fiscal and an annual impairment review during the fourth quarter of fiscal neither review found impairment 
under our accounting policy we plan to perform an annual review in the fourth quarter of each future fiscal year  or more often if indicators of impairment exist 
our annual reviews consider estimates of the fair value of our reporting units  and may include analyses of projected discounted cash flows  using management s estimates of future revenues and expenses over a multi year horizon 
as of march   our assets included million in goodwill related to the acquisitions of newave and solidum 
overview idt posted significantly lower operating results in fiscal  in part due to a somewhat weaker business environment than in fiscal  but primarily due to restructuring and asset impairment charges recorded in the fourth quarter 
after some signs of stabilizing business opportunities early in the fiscal year  revenue declined measurably in the third quarter of fiscal  and remained just above that new  lower baseline in the fourth quarter of fiscal as the year progressed  it became clear that global capital spending on the communications infrastructure equipment that our customers produce would remain at depressed levels  if not decline further below fiscal levels 
weak economic conditions persisted across multiple geographies and industries  and concerns about corporate profitability  excess build out of communications infrastructure in prior periods  and the prospect of war in iraq all dampened spending in the equipment markets that our customers serve 
recognizing these dynamics  our customers took steps to further reduce their spending on products from suppliers such as idt  including lowering their inventory levels and pressing for price reductions and other concessions 
in response to this difficult business environment  we maintained tight controls on hiring  capital purchases and discretionary spending throughout the fiscal year 
in the first  third and fourth quarters of fiscal  we implemented reductions in force that affected substantially all organizations throughout the company 
we exited fiscal with total headcount of approximately  down by about  employees or from peak employment levels during fiscal following the sharp drop in revenue that occurred in the third quarter of fiscal  in the fourth quarter we took additional restructuring and cost reduction measures that included closing our dallas design center  consolidating our field sales organization  and suspending or reducing certain employee benefit programs  all in addition to the headcount reductions described earlier 
we also determined that under applicable accounting rules  manufacturing assets primarily related to our wafer manufacturing operations in hillsboro  oregon and certain intangible assets related to existing technology from our acquisition of newave were impaired 
we recorded asset impairment charges of approximately million to adjust our carrying values for these assets to be consistent with their estimated fair market values 
despite the actions described above  we maintained key research and development programs throughout fiscal due primarily to our acquisition of solidum in the third quarter of fiscal  our personnel resources dedicated to product design and engineering actually increased in fiscal compared to  while our overall r d expenses remained essentially flat 
we also preserved a strong financial position  and ended fiscal with little debt and million in cash and investments excluding equity investments 
results of operations revenues fiscal compared to fiscal 
our revenues for fiscal were million  a decrease of million or compared to the previous year 
for both of our product segments  increases in unit volumes shipped were more than offset by declines in average unit selling prices  or asps 
pricing pressures were greatest where multiple sources of supply exist  such as in our sram segment 
revenues for our communications and high performance logic segment which includes fifos and multiports  communications applications specific standard products assps  and high performance logic and timing products declined by million or 
revenues for our srams segment declined by million or 
the magnitude of the sequential revenue decline in fiscal was considerably less severe than in fiscal  though the decline occurred versus the already much lower fiscal revenue base 
late in fiscal and early in fiscal  there appeared to be some stability in our end markets  as we experienced modest growth 
however  after growing sequentially in the fourth quarter of fiscal and the first quarter of fiscal and holding flat in the second quarter of fiscal  we experienced another measurable decline in revenue in the third quarter of fiscal persistent concerns about generally weak economic conditions  poor corporate profitability and more recently conflict in the middle east  once again dampened capital spending by both corporate enterprises and communications service providers  to which our customers are sensitive 
global economic conditions  and particularly the business environment and corporate profitability  directly impact demand in our customers markets and change our customers buying patterns accordingly 
recurring uncertainty in the economic outlook throughout fiscal caused our customers to maintain or further reduce already low inventory levels  to continue to defer placing firm purchase commitments for as long as possible  and to continue to demand that products be delivered on very short lead times  all resulting in lower levels of our order backlog 
customers are also increasingly demanding not only price reductions  but that suppliers such as idt bear the cost and risk of holding inventory 
during fiscal  for example  our sales under consignment programs principally to contract manufacturers increased from an insignificant amount at the beginning of the year to approximately of revenues in the fourth quarter 
revenues recent trends and outlook 
while there are some signs that our revenue levels may have stabilized recently  such as the modest growth that occurred from the third quarter of fiscal to the fourth quarter of fiscal  our order visibility remains poor 
this continuing lack of order visibility  together with ongoing uncertain conditions in the economies  markets  and customers that we serve  make it difficult to predict levels of revenue in future periods 
revenues fiscal compared to fiscal 
our revenues for fiscal were million  a decrease of million or compared to the record level set the previous year 
revenues for our communications and high performance logic segment declined by million or  while revenues for our srams segment declined by million or units sold declined significantly in both segments  and this was the primary cause of the revenue decline 
company wide  unit sales volumes dropped by almost from the record shipment levels of fiscal as global capacity to produce integrated circuits exceeded demand  pricing came under pressure in fiscal  and asps also declined 
this was particularly true for products we sell where multiple sources exist  such as in our srams segment 
as noted above  global economic conditions have a direct impact on demand in our customers markets  and broadly weaker economic conditions affect capital spending trends  to which our customers are sensitive 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  industry wide demand for our customers communications equipment began what became one of the steepest declines on record 
weaker global economic conditions and reduced customer demand existed throughout most of fiscal in all of our sales channels distributors  contract manufacturers or cems  and direct customers or oems 
our customers also consistently reacted to changes in their end markets by taking steps to materially reduce their finished goods  work in process and component inventories 
this industry wide trend further decreased demand for our products in both our communications and high performance logic and sram segments 
gross profit fiscal compared to fiscal 
gross profit for fiscal was million  down from million in fiscal our gross profit margin percentage declined to in fiscal from in fiscal the decline in gross profit in fiscal year was primarily driven by an increase in restructuring and asset impairment charges to million in fiscal from million if fiscal in fiscal  we recorded an asset impairment charge of million to reduce the carrying value of manufacturing assets primarily related to our hillsboro wafer fabrication operations 
for further discussion of this charge  see restructuring charges  asset impairment  and other  below 
in addition  gross profit was negatively impacted in fiscal by lower revenues and poorer utilization of our hillsboro wafer manufacturing facility  as we purposefully reduced our inventory levels by almost half over the course of the fiscal year 
higher unit sales volumes and a somewhat better mix of products sold were more than offset by lower product average selling prices 
the above adverse impacts were only partially offset by cost savings related to the closure of our salinas wafer fabrication facility fab  reduced variable spending in hillsboro related to the lower fab production volumes  and lower personnel related costs  as a result of reductions in force implemented in both fiscal and fiscal finally  gross profit in fiscal benefited from the sale of approximately million of inventory previously reserved as excess 
gross profit fiscal compared to fiscal 
gross profit for fiscal was million  a decrease of million compared to the million recorded in fiscal our gross profit margin percentage for was compared to for fiscal the decline in gross profit in fiscal year was primarily attributable to substantially lower revenues and the corresponding reduced levels of utilization of fixed manufacturing infrastructure 
in comparison to fiscal  gross profit was adversely impacted by the reduced number of units sold  lower asps  and increases in excess inventory reserves 
in addition  we incurred restructuring and asset impairment charges of million in fiscal vs 
none in fiscal see restructuring charges  asset impairment and other  below 
these pressures were partially offset by lower variable manufacturing spending  depreciation expenses  and personnel related costs  which resulted from the lower business volumes and the headcount reductions  facility shutdowns  and other cost reduction measures that the company implemented in response 
restructuring charges  asset impairment and other 
as discussed previously in the overview section  there were some initial signs of stabilizing revenue opportunities early in fiscal after three consecutive quarters in which revenues either improved or remained essentially unchanged from the immediately preceding period  revenue declined measurably in the third quarter of fiscal during the course of the fourth quarter of fiscal  taking this drop off into consideration as well as the persistent weak global and industry economic conditions  we revised our near and medium term revenue expectations downward significantly 
we also reviewed corresponding key assumptions in our overall strategic business and manufacturing capacity plans 
these material changes in our outlook and plans  which we were first able to quantify in our fiscal fourth quarter budgeting process  again triggered an impairment review of our long lived assets 
our review indicated that estimated future undiscounted cash flows would not be sufficient to recover the carrying values of certain assets 
as a result  we recorded a charge of million to write down these assets  primarily those related to our wafer fabrication operations  to their estimated fair values based mostly on independent appraisals and  to a lesser extent  certain management estimates 
of the million charge  million was recorded as cost of sales and the remainder as research and development 
during the same review  we also determined in the fourth quarter of fiscal that certain intangible assets related to our acquisition of newave  specifically existing technology  had also become impaired  and we recorded a million charge to cost of sales to adjust the existing technology asset to its estimated fair market value 
in fiscal  we also took actions  including reductions in force and the closure of certain design and sales facilities  to better align our business model with current industry conditions and our revised revenue expectations 
during fiscal  we recorded restructuring charges of million  which consisted primarily of severance and related termination benefits related to reductions in force 
the charges were incurred in the first  third and fourth quarters of fiscal and were recorded as cost of revenues million and operating expenses million 
fiscal was also a year of cyclically poor business conditions and overcapacity in the semiconductor industry 
we recorded million in asset impairment and million in restructuring charges in fiscal  of which million was recorded as cost of goods sold and the remainder as operating expenses 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we performed impairment reviews of our manufacturing facilities 
we determined that future undiscounted cash flows related to our salinas wafer fab  would not be sufficient to recover the carrying values of the assets in that facility 
we accordingly wrote down the assets to their fair values on the basis of independent appraisals and management estimates  resulting in a charge of million 
we are continuing to evaluate our ability to realize the carrying value of these held for sale assets at the end of each period until the assets are sold or disposed of  and there can be no assurance that further adjustments will not be necessary in the future 
in addition to expenses specifically identified as asset impairment and restructuring charges  we incurred other salinas related closure expenses in fiscal and  mainly for retention bonuses 
these expenses totaled million in fiscal million in  and we expect future expenses to be insignificant 
we phased out production at the salinas wafer fab and completed the transfer of production to our hillsboro wafer fab in the first quarter of fiscal  and we first realized the full benefit in gross profit of this consolidation in the second quarter of fiscal in fiscal  we recorded million in expenses related to restructuring actions  consisting mainly of worldwide reductions in force in our manufacturing and administrative organizations 
such expenses were recorded as cost of goods sold million and operating expenses million 
research and development 
r d spending of million  million  and million  for fiscal years  and  respectively  was essentially flat over this three year period 
during fiscal  lower allocations of manufacturing costs to r d activities  lower product tooling costs  lower outside product development fees  and lower stock based deferred compensation expenses related to our newave acquisition were offset by a charge of million for the impairment of r d assets related to our hillsboro fabrication facility and increased design engineering costs associated with our acquisition of solidum 
during fiscal  we added significant design and engineering resources in our communications and high performance logic segment through our acquisition of newave in april in addition to higher operating expenses associated with the newave design team  we also incurred million in expenses during fiscal for newave related contingent compensation and stock based compensation amortization 
cost allocations to r d related to new product development and depreciation expense associated with r d equipment also increased 
these expense increases were offset by a combination of lower profit sharing and other performance related personnel costs and continued control over discretionary spending 
in fiscal  our new product development efforts are expected to continue to focus in such areas as fifos and multi ported communications products  networking and switching products such as our network search engines incorporating content addressable memory or cam technology and content inspection engines  timing and clock products  integrated communications processors  and advanced telecommunications products 
we are also continuing to develop manufacturing process technologies designed to increase efficiency or enable product performance advantages 
as a result of the cost reduction measures  restructuring actions  and asset impairment charges previously described  and planned lower allocations of manufacturing costs to r d  we expect that r d spending in fiscal will decrease significantly in comparison to fiscal selling  general and administrative 
sg a expenses declined by million in fiscal to million 
in fiscal  sg a spending had declined by million from the prior year  to million 
the decrease in sg a spending in fiscal was driven by lower personnel and revenue related costs 
labor spending was lower due to multiple reductions in force  offset partially by related severance costs 
outside sales commissions were down due to lower revenues and a new commission plan implemented early in the year 
depreciation  discretionary expenses  and other headcount based costs were also lower 
these savings were partially offset by higher spending on outside services and corporate insurance during fiscal  and by bad debt expenses which were lower than expected in fiscal the decrease in sg a expenses from fiscal to fiscal relates primarily to reduced personnel related costs  lower revenue dependent expenses  and controls implemented over discretionary spending 
personnel related costs declined due to headcount reductions implemented throughout the year and the absence of profit dependent personnel expenses such as management bonuses and employee profit sharing expenses 
other revenue dependent expenses such as sales incentives and outside sales commissions were also lower 
we also reduced other discretionary operating expenses such as recruiting  advertising  travel and other outside services  in response to the weak business environment 
due primarily to the cost reduction and restructuring measures implemented in fiscal  we expect that the absolute dollar level of sg a spending in fiscal will decline compared with fiscal acquired in process research and development 
in connection with our acquisition of solidum  we recorded a million charge for acquired in process research and development ipr d in fiscal we recorded a million charge for ipr d in fiscal related to our acquisition of newave 
for both transactions  the allocation of the purchase price to ipr d was determined by identifying technologies that had not attained technological feasibility and that did not have future alternative uses 
amortization of intangibles 
during fiscal  goodwill related to the newave transaction was amortized to expenses in accordance with an estimated useful life of seven years using the straight line method 
as a result of our adoption of sfas no 
 amortization of certain intangibles  primarily goodwill  ceased as of the beginning of fiscal this is the main reason why amortization of intangibles decreased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal other identified intangibles related to the newave and solidum acquisitions are being amortized over estimated useful lives of two to seven years  also using the straight line method 
gains and losses on equity investments  net 
during the fiscal period  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  we recorded various gains and losses in connection with our equity investment holdings in quantum effect devices  inc qed  pmc and monolithic system technology mosys 
these gains and losses are summarized as follows in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal gain on exchange of qed shares  realized gains on sales of qed shares realized gains losses on sales of pmc shares  realized gains on sales of mosys shares  other than temporary impairment charges   gains losses on equity investments  net    as of march   we continued to hold approximately  shares of pmc 
our pretax  unrealized gain associated with these holdings was million 
interest income and other  net 
changes in interest income and other  net are summarized as follows in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal interest income    other income  net   interest income and other  net    the million decrease in interest income in fiscal compared to fiscal is principally due to lower rates and to a lesser extent  lower balances 
interest income declined by million in fiscal compared to fiscal  due to lower average interest rates and  to a lesser extent  lower average investment balances 
other income  net  in fiscal includes a pre tax gain of million related to our exercise of an option to purchase land adjacent to our wafer manufacturing facility in hillsboro 
immediately following the option exercise  we sold most of the underlying property and recognized the gain 
provision for taxes 
our tax provision of million for fiscal consists primarily of a valuation allowance recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal against our net deferred tax assets 
as a result of establishing this valuation allowance  we recorded no tax benefit on pretax losses and tax credits generated during fiscal we also do not expect to recognize tax benefits on future operating losses until a sufficient level of profitability is reached 
we recorded a million income tax benefit in fiscal our effective tax rate for fiscal of varied from the federal statutory rate mainly due to the effects of non deductible acquisition related costs and foreign losses 
in fiscal  our tax rate was  which included the effects of deferred gains on investments  the reversal in fiscal of most of the valuation allowance reserve recorded against our net deferred tax assets  and the use of net operating loss and tax credit carryovers 
we benefit from certain tax benefits in malaysia and the philippines  mainly as a result of tax holidays  tax rate reductions  and certain investment incentives 
we currently expect that idt s fiscal tax provision expense will be very close to zero in the us  with a small amount of tax provision expense being recorded on income generated in certain foreign tax jurisdictions 
liquidity and capital resources our cash and marketable securities were million at march   a decrease of million compared to march  long and short term debt  excluding operating leases  was million as of march  net cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal  compared to a use of million for fiscal during fiscal  our net loss  exclusive of noncash charges  was largely offset by depreciation and by changes in working capital balances 
inventories  net  were reduced by million during fiscal as we purposely worked down our inventories to better align with current business levels 
deferred income on shipments to distributors decreased by million over this period  as our distributors also reduced levels of channel inventory 
net cash used for operating activities was million in fiscal our operating activities provided million in fiscal lower operating results were the main cause of the decline in cash flows from operations in fiscal compared to fiscal other factors included lower tax benefits from employee stock plans  lower accounts payable balances and decreased deferred income on shipments to distributors due to lower levels of distributor channel inventory  decreased accrued compensation due to payouts of profit dependent personnel expenses accrued in fiscal and paid in fiscal  and decreased income taxes payable 
these factors were partially offset by reduced levels of accounts receivable during fiscal  reflecting the lower level of business volumes 
we used million  million and million for investing activities in fiscal  and  respectively 
in fiscal  we elected to terminate the synthetic lease related to our hillsboro  oregon  manufacturing site and exercised our option to purchase approximately million in additional fixed assets  with most of the purchase price approximately million funded by amounts already pledged to collateralize the lease  and the balance approximately million funded by existing cash and investments 
also in fiscal  we invested million in an interest bearing  convertible financial instrument which was subsequently converted into preferred shares of a privately held technology related company 
among the major uses of cash for fiscal was million for the newave acquisition 
we have reduced spending on capital  and expenditures decreased to million and million in fiscal and  respectively  compared to million in fiscal sales of maturing investments  net of purchases  provided million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
we used million for financing activities in fiscal our financing activities used million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
significant financing activities in fiscal  and fiscal included repurchases of common stock million  million and million  respectively 
we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately million during fiscal  depending upon business conditions  to be financed primarily through cash generated from operations and existing cash and investments 
this estimate includes expenditures of approximately million to exercise purchase options related to certain equipment leases 
the following table summarizes our contractual arrangements at march   and the expected timing and effects of these commitments on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years after years long term debt capital leases    operating leases      other long term  cash liabilities reflected on the balance sheet under gaap total      we believe that existing cash and investment balances  together with cash flows from operations  will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs through fiscal and we may choose to investigate other financing alternatives  however  we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available on satisfactory terms

factors affecting future results our operating results can fluctuate dramatically 
we recorded net losses of million and million in fiscal and  respectively  after reporting net income of million in fiscal fluctuations in operating results can result from a wide variety of factors  including the cyclicality of the semiconductor industry and industry wide wafer processing capacity  changes in demand for our products and in the markets we serve  the success and timing of new product and process technology announcements and introductions from us or our competitors  potential loss of market share among a concentrated group of customers  competitive pricing pressures  changes in the demand for and mix of products sold  complex manufacturing and logistics operations  availability and costs of raw materials  and of foundry and other manufacturing services  costs associated with other events  such as intellectual property disputes  or other litigation  and political and economic conditions in various geographic areas 
in addition  many of these factors also impact the recoverability of the carrying value of certain manufacturing  tax  goodwill  and other tangible and intangible assets 
as business conditions change  future writedowns or abandonment of these assets may occur 
in fiscal  we recorded impairment charges totaling million for certain manufacturing  research and development  intangible and tax assets 
further  we may be unable to compete successfully in the future against existing or potential competitors  and our operating results could be harmed by increased competition 
our operating results are also impacted by changes in overall economic conditions  both domestically and abroad 
should economic conditions deteriorate  domestically or overseas  our sales and business results could be harmed 
the cyclicality of the semiconductor industry exacerbates the volatility of our operating results 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical 
substantial changes in demand for our products have occurred rapidly and suddenly in the past 
in addition  market conditions characterized by excess supply relative to demand and resulting pricing declines have also occurred in the past 
significant shifts in demand for our products and pricing declines resulting from excess supply may occur in the future 
large and rapid swings in demand and pricing for our products can result in significantly lower revenues and underutilization of our fixed cost infrastructure  both of which would cause material fluctuations in our gross margins and our operating results 
demand for our products depends primarily on demand in the communications markets 
the majority of our products are incorporated into customers systems in enterprise carrier class network  wireless infrastructure and access network applications 
a smaller percentage of our products also serve in customers computer storage  computer related  and other applications 
customer applications for our products have historically been characterized by rapid technological change and significant fluctuations in demand 
demand for most of our products  and therefore potential increases in revenue  depends upon growth in the communications market  particularly in the data networking and wireless telecommunications infrastructure markets and  to a lesser extent  the computer related markets 
any slowdown in these communications or computer related markets could materially adversely affect our operating results  as evidenced by conditions in fiscal and our results are dependent on the success of new products 
new products and wafer processing technology will continue to require significant r d expenditures 
if we are unable to develop  produce and successfully market new products in a timely manner  and to sell them at gross margins comparable to or better than our current products  our future results of operations could be adversely impacted 
in addition  our future revenue growth is also partially dependent on our ability to penetrate new markets  where we have limited experience and where competitors are already entrenched 
even if we are able to develop  produce and successfully market new products in a timely manner  such new products may not achieve market acceptance 
we are dependent on a concentrated group of customers for a significant part of our revenues 
we are dependent on a limited number of oem end customers  and our future results depend significantly on the strategic relationships we have formed with them 
if these relationships were to diminish  and if these customers were to develop their own solutions or adopt a competitor s solution instead of buying our products  our results could be adversely affected 
for example  any diminished relationship with cisco or other key customers could adversely affect our results 
we estimate that when all channels of distribution are considered  cisco represented approximately of our total revenues for fiscal many of our end customer oems have outsourced their manufacturing to a concentrated group of global cems who then buy product directly from us on behalf of the oem 
cems have achieved greater autonomy in the design win  product qualification and product purchasing decisions  especially for commodity products 
furthermore  these cems have generally been centralizing their global procurement processes 
this has had the effect of concentrating a significant percentage of our revenue with a small number of companies 
competition for the business of these cems is intense and there is no assurance we can remain competitive and retain our existing market share within these customers 
if these companies were to allocate a higher share of commodity or second source business to our competitors instead of buying our products  our results would be adversely affected 
furthermore  as these cems represent a growing percentage of our overall business  our concentration of credit and other business risks with these customers has increased 
competition among global cems is intense  they operate on extremely thin margins  and their financial condition  on average  has declined significantly during the current industry downturn 
if any one or more of these global cems were to file for bankruptcy or otherwise experience significantly adverse financial conditions  our business would be adversely impacted as well 
as of march   one cem  celestica  accounted for approximately of our revenue during fy and represented approximately of our accounts receivable as of march  finally  we utilize a relatively small number of global and regional distributors around the world  who also buy product directly from us on behalf of their customers 
if our business relationships were to diminish or any one or more of these global distributors were to file for bankruptcy or otherwise experience significantly adverse financial conditions  our business could be adversely impacted 
one distributor represented of revenues for fiscal our product manufacturing operations are complex and subject to interruption 
from time to time  we have experienced production difficulties  including reduced manufacturing yields or products that do not meet our or our customers specifications that have caused delivery delays  quality problems  and possibly lost revenue opportunities 
while delivery delays have been infrequent and generally short in duration  we could experience manufacturing problems  capacity constraints and or product delivery delays in the future as a result of  among other things  complexity of manufacturing processes  changes to our process technologies including transfers to other facilities and die size reduction efforts  and ramping production and installing new equipment at our facilities 
substantially all of our revenues are derived from products manufactured at facilities which are exposed to the risk of natural disasters 
we have a wafer fabrication facility in hillsboro  oregon  and assembly and test facilities in the philippines and malaysia 
if we were unable to use our facilities  as a result of a natural disaster or otherwise  our operations would be materially adversely affected 
we are dependent upon electric power generated by public utilities where we operate our manufacturing facilities and we have periodically experienced electrical power interruptions 
we maintain limited backup generating capability  but the amount of electric power that we can generate on our own is insufficient to fully operate these facilities  and prolonged power interruptions could have a significant adverse impact on our business 
historically  we have utilized subcontractors for the majority of our incremental assembly requirements  typically at higher costs than at our own malaysian and philippines assembly and test operations 
we expect to continue utilizing subcontractors to supplement our own production volume capacity 
due to production lead times and potential subcontractor capacity constraints  any failure on our part to adequately forecast the mix of product demand could adversely affect our operating results 
much of our manufacturing capability is relatively fixed in nature 
much of our manufacturing cost structure remains fixed in nature and large and rapid swings in demand for our products can make it difficult to efficiently utilize this capacity on a consistent basis 
significant downturns  as we have recently experienced  will result in material under utilization of our manufacturing facilities while sudden upturns could leave us short of capacity and unable to capitalize on incremental revenue opportunities 
these swings and the resulting under utilization of our manufacturing capacity or inability to procure sufficient capacity to meet end customer demand for our products will cause material fluctuations in the gross margins we report and could have a material adverse affect thereon 
we build most of our products based on estimated demand forecasts 
demand for our products can change rapidly and without advance notice 
demand and our visibility on demand for our products can also be affected by changes in our customer s levels of inventory and differences in the timing and order patterns between them and their end customers 
if demand forecasts are inaccurate or change suddenly  we may me be left with large amounts of unsold products  may not be able to fill all orders in the short term and may not be able to accurately forecast capacity utilization and other important business metrics 
this can leave us holding excess and obsolete inventory or unable to meet customer short term demands all of which can have an adverse impact on our operating results 
we are dependent on a limited number of suppliers 
our manufacturing operations depend upon obtaining adequate raw materials on a timely basis 
the number of vendors of certain raw materials  such as silicon wafers  ultra pure metals and certain chemicals and gases  is very limited 
in addition  certain packages require long lead times and are available from only a few suppliers 
from time to time  vendors have extended lead times or limited supply to us due to capacity constraints 
although we currently fabricate most of our wafers internally  we are dependent on outside foundries for a small but growing portion of our wafer requirements 
our results of operations would be materially adversely affected if we were unable to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials in a timely manner or if there were significant increases in the costs of raw materials  or if foundry capacity were not available or was only available at uncompetitive prices 
we are subject to a variety of environmental and other regulations related to hazardous materials used in our manufacturing processes 
any failure by us to adequately control the use or discharge of hazardous materials under present or future regulations could subject us to substantial costs or liabilities or cause our manufacturing operations to be suspended 
intellectual property claims could adversely affect our business and operations 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights  which have resulted in significant and often protracted and expensive litigation 
in recent years  there has been a growing trend by companies to resort to litigation to protect their semiconductor technology from unauthorized use by others 
we have been involved in patent litigation in the past  which adversely affected our operating results 
although we have obtained patent licenses from certain semiconductor manufacturers  we do not have licenses from a number of semiconductor manufacturers that have broad patent portfolios 
claims alleging infringement of intellectual property rights have been asserted against us and could be asserted against us in the future 
these claims could result in our having to discontinue the use of certain processes  cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products  incur significant litigation costs and damages  and develop non infringing technology 
we might not be able to obtain such licenses on acceptable terms or to develop non infringing technology 
further  the failure to renew or renegotiate existing licenses on favorable terms  or the inability to obtain a key license  could materially adversely affect our business 
international operations add increased volatility to our operating results 
a substantial percentage of our revenues are derived from international sales  as summarized below percentage of total revenues fiscal fiscal fiscal americas asia pacific japan europe total in addition  our assembly and test facilities in malaysia and the philippines  our design centers in canada  china and australia  and our foreign sales offices incur payroll  facility and other expenses in local currencies 
accordingly  movements in foreign currency exchange rates can impact our revenues and costs of goods sold  as well as both pricing and demand for our products 
our offshore sites and export sales are also subject to risks associated with foreign operations  including political instability and acts of war or terrorism  which could disrupt our manufacturing activities  currency controls and fluctuations  changes in local economic conditions  and changes in tax laws  import and export controls  tariffs and freight rates 
contract pricing for raw materials and equipment used in the fabrication and assembly processes  as well as for foundry and subcontract assembly services  can also be impacted by currency exchange rate fluctuations 
finally  in support of our international operations  a portion of our cash and investment portfolio resides offshore 
at march   we had cash and investments of approximately million invested overseas in accounts belonging to various idt foreign operating entities 
while these amounts are primarily invested in us dollars  a portion is held in foreign currencies  and all offshore balances are exposed to local political  banking  and other risks 
we depend on the ability of our personnel  raw materials  equipment and products to move reasonably unimpeded around the world 
any political  military  world health eg  sars or other issue which hinders this movement or restricts the import or export of materials could lead to significant business disruptions 
furthermore  any strike  economic failure  or other material disruption on the part of major airlines or other transportation companies could also adversely affect our ability to conduct business 
if such disruptions result in cancellations of customer orders or contribute to a general decrease in economic activity or corporate spending on information technology  or directly impact our marketing  manufacturing  financial and logistics functions our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
we are exposed to potential impairment charges on investments 
from time to time  we have made strategic investments in other companies  both public and private 
if the companies that we invest in are unable to execute their plans and succeed in their respective markets  we may not benefit from such investments  and we could potentially lose all of the amounts we invest 
in addition  we evaluate our portfolio  including non marketable equity securities  on a regular basis to determine if impairments have occurred 
impairment charges could have a material impact on our results of operations in any period 
as of march   we carried approximately million of such investments  including million in marketable equity securities and million in other assets 
our common stock has experienced substantial price volatility 
such volatility may occur in the future  particularly as a result of quarter to quarter variations in the actual or anticipated financial results of idt  other semiconductor companies  or our customers 
stock price volatility may also result from product announcements by us or our competitors  or from changes in perceptions about the various types of products we manufacture and sell 
in addition  our stock price may fluctuate due to price and volume fluctuations in the stock market  especially in the technology sector 
we are dependent on key personnel 
our performance is substantially dependent on the performance of our executive officers and key employees 
the loss of the services of any our executive officers  technical personnel or other key employees could adversely affect our business 
in addition  our future success depends on our ability to successfully compete with other technology firms in attracting and retaining key technical and management personnel 
if we are unable to identify and hire highly qualified technical and managerial personnel  our business could be harmed 
we may have difficulty integrating acquired companies 
we acquired newave and solidum in fiscal and  respectively  and we may pursue other acquisitions in the future 
failure to successfully integrate acquired companies into our business could adversely affect our results of operations 
integration risks and issues may include  but are not limited to  personnel retention and assimilation  management distraction  technology development  and unexpected costs and liabilities  including goodwill impairment charges 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our interest rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio  which consisted of million in cash and cash equivalents and million in short term investments as of march  by policy  we limit our exposure to longer term investments  and a substantial majority of our investment portfolio at the end of fiscal and the end of fiscal had maturities of less than two years 
as a result of the relatively short duration of our portfolio  a hypothetical move in interest rates would have an insignificant effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we do not currently use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
by policy  we mitigate the credit risk in our investment portfolio through diversification and  for debt securities  adherence to high credit quality rating standards 
we have minimal interest rate risk with respect to debt  since our balance sheet at march  included only million in debt 
we are exposed to currency exchange rate risk as a result of international sales  assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries  and capital purchases denominated in foreign currencies 
we use derivative financial instruments primarily forward contracts to help manage our foreign currency exposures 
we do not enter into derivatives for trading purposes 
we performed a sensitivity analysis for both fiscal and fiscal and determined that a change in the value of the us dollar would have an insignificant near term impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows
