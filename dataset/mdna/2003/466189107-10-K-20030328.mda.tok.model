overview we are a multi channel specialty retailer of high quality women s apparel  accessories and footwear 
we market our products through catalogs  retail stores and an e commerce website 
we currently have two reportable business segments  direct and retail 
each segment is separately managed and utilizes distinct distribution  marketing and inventory management strategies 
the direct segment markets merchandise through catalogs and an e commerce website 
the retail segment markets merchandise through retail stores 
our fiscal year ends on the last saturday in december 
the twelve months ended december  fiscal and december  fiscal were week fiscal years 
the twelve months ended december  fiscal was a week fiscal year 
in a week fiscal year  three of the quarters are week periods  and one is a week period 
the fourth quarter of fiscal was a week period 
during fiscal  we effected a three for two stock split in the form of a stock dividend paid on june  to shareholders of record on june  all share and per share data has been adjusted for the stock split 
net sales for fiscal increased by to million from million in fiscal income before interest  taxes and cumulative effect for fiscal was million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales in the prior year 
net income for fiscal was million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share in fiscal results of operations the following table presents our consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of net sales twelve months ended december  december  december  weeks net sales cost of products and merchandising gross margin selling  general and administrative expenses income before interest  taxes and cumulative effect interest  net income before taxes and cumulative effect income tax provision income before cumulative effect cumulative effect of accounting change  net of tax net income the following table summarizes net sales by segment in thousands twelve months ended december  december  december  weeks direct    retail    other    total net sales    other represents certain sales allowances not specifically attributable to the direct or retail business segments 
comparison of fiscal to fiscal net sales increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal during fiscal  retail segment net sales increased by to million from million in fiscal primarily as a result of increased store count 
during fiscal  we opened retail stores and one retail outlet store 
at december   we had retail stores open compared to at december  direct segment net sales increased by primarily as a result of a increase in square inches circulated during fiscal compared to fiscal e commerce net sales represented of total direct segment net sales during fiscal compared to during fiscal sales productivity  as measured by demand per  square inches circulated in the direct segment and sales per square foot in the retail segment  was lower in fiscal as compared to fiscal our direct segment experienced a decline in catalog productivity in fiscal as compared to fiscal which was primarily attributable to increased circulation levels and the disappointing results of our fall bestseller catalog  combined with a lower percentage of off price sales 
off price catalogs typically generate more sales per square inch circulated than full price catalogs 
sales per square foot in our retail segment declined in fiscal as compared to fiscal as a result of several factors including a lower percentage of off price sales  lower overall in store inventory levels and the cannibalization impact of filling in markets 
additionally  both segments were negatively affected by the external pressures from the very difficult retail environment during the year 
gross margin represents net sales less cost of products and merchandising 
cost of products and merchandising consists primarily of merchandise development  control and acquisition costs  provisions for markdowns  order processing and customer service costs  distribution facility costs and occupancy and depreciation costs for our stores 
during fiscal  our gross margin increased by million  or  to million from million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  our gross margin increased to during fiscal from during fiscal this increase in gross margin as a percentage of net sales was primarily as a result of our inventory management strategy in fiscal our more conservative inventory management strategy in fiscal resulted in fewer overstocks  less off price selling and lower markdown charges 
in addition  we were able to negotiate better prices with some of our vendors which resulted in higher initial markups in fiscal as compared to fiscal finally  our gross margin also benefited from lower order processing costs as a percentage of net sales and the leveraging of these costs over higher total company net sales 
these factors were partially offset by the de leveraging of retail occupancy and depreciation costs associated with our retail store rollout as well as an  asset impairment charge relating to one of our retail stores taken in the fourth quarter of fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of costs to produce  print and distribute catalogs  as well as e commerce website  retail store selling and corporate administrative costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to during fiscal from during fiscal this increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to lower sales productivity experienced in both the direct and retail segments and the growing impact of the retail segment on our overall results reflecting the fact that retail selling costs are currently higher as a percentage of net sales than direct selling costs 
in addition  selling  general and administrative expenses include two significant charges during fiscal these charges consisted of million in costs incurred related to a potential strategic acquisition that was abandoned and a million fully vested discretionary contribution into the deferred compensation plan for our president and chief executive officer 
interest income decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal interest expense decreased to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal comparison of fiscal to fiscal net sales increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal net sales growth from our retail segment was partially offset by slightly lower sales from our direct segment 
during fiscal  retail segment net sales grew by to million from million in fiscal during fiscal  we opened retail stores 
at december   we had retail stores open compared to at december  direct segment net sales decreased by and square inches circulated decreased by during fiscal compared to fiscal this decrease in direct segment net sales was largely as a result of there being an extra week of sales in fiscal e commerce net sales represented of total direct segment net sales during fiscal compared to during fiscal during fiscal  our gross margin increased by million  or  to million from million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  our gross margin decreased to during fiscal from during fiscal this decrease in gross margin as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to the de leveraging of retail occupancy and depreciation costs and to the more promotional retail environment in fiscal as compared to fiscal this decrease was partially offset by higher initial markups  lower markdown charges associated with better inventory management and the leveraging of certain merchandising and order processing costs over higher total company net sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to during fiscal from during fiscal this increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to the growing impact of the retail segment on our overall results and the fact that our retail selling costs were higher as a percentage of net sales than our direct selling costs 
interest income increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase in interest income was primarily a consequence of higher cash balances resulting from our stock offering during the first quarter of fiscal interest expense decreased to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal income taxes we provide for income taxes at an effective tax rate that includes the full federal and state statutory tax rates 
our effective tax rates for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  were  and  respectively 
the decline in the effective tax rate for fiscal reflects a decrease in the projected amount of non deductible expenses for fiscal as compared to fiscal partially offset by a state net operating loss nol carryforward valuation allowance and the impact of conducting business in states with higher tax rates 
our effective tax rate for fiscal is estimated to be 
the increased effective tax rate reflects an increase in the projected amount of non deductible expenses for fiscal at december   we placed a million valuation allowance against a portion of our deferred tax assets related to state nol carryforwards where we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax benefit of these nol carryforwards will not be realized 
see note j to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
cumulative effect of accounting change effective as of december   we changed our revenue recognition policy to be in accordance with the provisions of the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
under sab  revenue is recognized at time of customer receipt rather than upon shipment of goods to the customer 
the cumulative effect of this change for periods prior to fiscal totaled  net of taxes of  and is reflected in the first quarter of fiscal segment direct contribution we currently have two reportable business segments  direct and retail 
segment reporting is intended to give financial statement users a view of our business through the eyes of management 
our internal management reporting is the basis for the information disclosed for our business segments 
our internally defined measure of segment profit or loss  direct contribution  is required to be disclosed according to generally accepted accounting principles gaap but is not a gaap measure 
information related to segment direct contribution should be read in conjunction with the reconciliation to income before interest  taxes and cumulative effect as determined by gaap 
we evaluate our segment profitability based on the direct contribution of each segment 
direct contribution represents each segment s net sales less direct costs related to the segment s operations 
direct costs for both segments include merchandise acquisition and control costs and provisions for markdowns 
direct costs also include catalog costs  certain order processing costs and e commerce selling costs for the direct segment and retail store selling  occupancy  depreciation and administrative costs for the retail segment 
direct contribution less unallocated shared service costs and general and administrative expenses is equal to income before interest  taxes and cumulative effect 
unallocated shared service costs include distribution and warehousing costs as well as merchandising and product development costs 
general and administrative expenses include corporate executive management costs  support service costs eg  shared information systems  finance and human resources and corporate headquarter occupancy costs 
the accounting policies of our segments are the same as those described in note b to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in addition  inter segment balances and transactions have been eliminated 
the following table summarizes direct contribution by segment and provides a reconciliation of segment direct contribution to income before interest  taxes and cumulative effect in thousands twelve months ended december  december  december  weeks direct    retail   total direct contribution    unallocated shared service costs    general and administrative expenses    income before interest  taxes and cumulative effect   direct segment the direct segment s fiscal direct contribution increased by million  or  compared to fiscal as a percentage of segment net sales  direct contribution increased to during fiscal from during fiscal this increase in direct contribution as a percentage of segment net sales was primarily attributable to higher gross margins associated with increased full price sales volumes  better inventory management  lower markdown charges and higher initial markups as compared to fiscal this gross margin improvement was partially offset by higher selling expenses as a percentage of segment net sales as a result of lower catalog productivity 
the direct segment s fiscal direct contribution decreased by million  or  compared to fiscal as a percentage of segment net sales  direct contribution increased to during fiscal from during fiscal this increase in direct contribution as a percentage of segment net sales was primarily attributable to higher initial markups and cost control measures taken during fiscal partially offsetting these benefits were slightly higher selling expenses as a percentage of segment net sales 
retail segment the retail segment s fiscal direct contribution increased by million  or  compared to fiscal as a percentage of segment net sales  direct contribution increased to during fiscal from during fiscal this increase in direct contribution as a percentage of segment net sales was primarily attributable to higher gross margins associated with increased full price sales volumes  better inventory management  lower markdown charges and higher initial markups as compared to fiscal this gross margin improvement was partially offset by higher occupancy  depreciation and selling costs as a percentage of segment net sales as a result of lower sales productivity  as well as an  asset impairment charge relating to one of our retail stores taken in the fourth quarter of fiscal the retail segment s fiscal direct contribution increased by million to million from million in fiscal as a percentage of segment net sales  direct contribution increased to during fiscal from during fiscal this increase in direct contribution as a percentage of segment net sales was primarily attributable to higher initial markups and lower markdown charges associated with better inventory management in fiscal as compared to fiscal in addition  selling costs were lower as a percentage of segment net sales in fiscal the positive impact of these factors was partially offset by higher occupancy and depreciation costs related to new retail stores 
seasonality and quarterly fluctuations as retail becomes a greater portion of our overall business  we expect that our business will become more seasonal 
our retail store rollout plan is expected to materially impact year over year comparisons of our net sales 
also  january is included in the first fiscal quarter for us  but is included in the fourth fiscal quarter for many other retailers 
because january is a month that traditionally involves significant promotional pricing  this difference needs to be taken into account when making comparisons of our financial performance for interim periods with that of other retailers 
liquidity and capital resources our principal working capital needs arise from the need to support costs incurred in advance of revenue generation  primarily inventory acquisition and catalog development  production and mailing costs 
we have two selling seasons that correspond to the fashion seasons 
the spring season begins in january and ends in july 
the fall season begins in july and ends in january 
our capital investment needs arise from initiatives intended to support our growth  including the retail store rollout and improvements to our physical and operating infrastructure 
during fiscal  we funded our working capital and capital investment needs primarily with cash generated from operations and our existing credit facilities 
cash and cash equivalents cash increased by million during fiscal approximately million in cash was generated from operations and million from stock transactions 
approximately million was invested in property and equipment  primarily related to our retail store rollout  million was transferred to a trust associated with our deferred compensation plan and million was used to pay down debt 
during fiscal  net income before depreciation and amortization  additional deferred credits from landlords and higher accrued expense balances were the primary sources of cash from operations 
the primary use of cash from operations was increases in accounts receivable principally associated with our deferred billing program 
cash increased by million during fiscal approximately million in cash was generated from operations and million in cash was raised as a result of our private placement of common stock in february approximately million was invested in property and equipment  primarily related to our retail store rollout  and million was used to pay down debt 
during fiscal  net income before depreciation and amortization  additional deferred credits from landlords and lower inventory balances were the primary sources of cash from operations 
the primary use of cash from operations was increases in accounts receivable principally associated with our deferred billing program 
on february   we issued and sold an aggregate of  shares of our common stock the restricted shares to accredited institutional investors in a private placement under rule under the securities act of the restricted shares were sold for cash at a price of per share  for gross proceeds of million 
the purchase price was established on january  and represented an discount from the nasdaq closing price on that date 
we paid a fee of of the gross proceeds from the sale of the restricted shares to our placement agent for the sale of the restricted shares  and incurred other expenses of approximately million in the transaction  resulting in net proceeds to us  after placement agent fees and other expenses  of million 
on february  a registration statement on form s relating to resale of the restricted shares became effective 
accounts receivable balances at december  were higher than at december   primarily as a result of increased amounts related to our holiday deferred billing program  which was offered for a longer period this year than last year  as well as increased landlord allowance receivables associated with new retail stores opened in fiscal inventory levels at december  were higher than at december   despite a significant increase in the number of retail stores open  largely as a result of our continued conservative inventory management strategy and the later timing of spring merchandise receipts due to the california dock workers labor dispute 
retail segment inventory totaled million at december  compared to million at december  direct segment inventory totaled million at december  compared to million at december  we feel that our inventory management in the direct segment was optimized in fiscal in our retail segment  we feel that our in store inventory levels were too conservative and therefore restricted potential sales growth 
we plan to increase our in store inventory levels by to to return to the level of average in store inventories maintained in fiscal accrued expense balances at december  were higher than at december   primarily due to increased accrued amounts related to our deferred compensation plan  gift certificates and our retail store operations 
deferred credits from landlords include step rent and allowances from landlords related to our retail store leases 
deferred credits from landlords at december  were higher than at december   primarily as a result of the additional retail stores opened since that date 
our credit facilities at december  consisted of i a million revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility  ii a million real estate loan the tilton facility loan  and iii a million equipment loan the equipment loan 
on july   we amended our revolving credit facility to extend its term and change certain lending conditions and compliance requirements including  among other things  changing the maximum number of new retail store openings allowed under the agreement to for the two year period consisting of fiscal and fiscal  and for each subsequent fiscal year 
in addition  the debt service coverage ratio was amended to be less restrictive with respect to capital expenditures to the extent that our cash balances exceed a predetermined level 
the maturity date of the revolving credit facility  as amended  is june  the revolving credit facility is collateralized by substantially all our personal property  both tangible and intangible 
at december   the revolving credit facility bore interest at per annum 
the amount available under the revolving credit facility is reduced by outstanding borrowings and outstanding letters of credit 
outstanding borrowings may not exceed million and bear interest at an annual rate equal to the prime lending rate announced by one of the participating banks or the libor lending rate plus per annum 
there were no outstanding borrowings on the revolving credit facility at december  or december  the maximum amount of borrowings on the revolving credit facility during fiscal and fiscal was million and million  respectively 
outstanding letters of credit totaled million and million at december  and december   respectively 
availability under the revolving credit facility at december  and december  was million and million  respectively  subject in each case to the million borrowing cap 
outstanding letters of credit do not bear interest 
we are required to pay a commitment fee of of per annum on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility 
the tilton facility loan is collateralized by a mortgage lien on our operations  fulfillment and distribution center in tilton  new hampshire the tilton facility 
the tilton facility is owned by birch pond realty corporation  a wholly owned subsidiary of the j 
jill group  inc  and leased to the j 
jill group  inc payments of principal and interest on the tilton facility loan  a year loan  are due monthly  based on a year amortization  with a balloon payment of the remaining balance payable on april  the interest rate on the tilton facility loan is fixed at per annum 
the equipment loan is collateralized by substantially all of our materials handling equipment 
there are currently four promissory notes outstanding under the equipment loan  requiring monthly payments of principal and interest through their maturities  which range from december  to march  the equipment loan has a weighted average interest rate of per annum 
the weighted average interest rate for amounts outstanding under our credit facilities during fiscal was per annum 
our credit facilities contain various lending conditions and covenants including restrictions on permitted liens 
in the case of the revolving credit facility  these conditions and covenants include certain financial coverage calculations and ratios  including i indebtedness and outstanding letter of credit balance to tangible net worth  ii hard current assets to current liabilities  iii debt service coverage  iv indebtedness  outstanding letter of credit balance and net present value of operating leases to tangible net worth  v minimum tangible net worth  and vi minimum net profit 
the manner of making these calculations and computing these ratios is defined by the provisions of the fifth amended and restated loan agreement  as amended  which is part of the revolving credit facility 
we were in compliance with the covenants associated with our respective credit facilities as of and for the years ended december  and december  at december   we had retail stores  one retail outlet store and three direct outlet stores open 
we expect to open to additional retail stores in fiscal the cash requirements related to our retail store initiative are significant and are primarily comprised of leasehold improvements  net of landlord allowances  and initial inventory acquisition costs 
the initial cash requirements for opening a new retail store are currently estimated at an average of approximately million per store 
at december   our cash requirements related to our outstanding long term debt and our future minimum lease payments for operating leases having a remaining term in excess of one year at such date were as follows in thousands long term debt lease commitments total fiscal    fiscal    fiscal    fiscal   fiscal   thereafter    total    at december   the maximum annual future minimum lease payments were million in in addition to the debt payments and lease commitments represented in the above table  we enter into a number of cancelable and non cancelable commitments during the year 
typically  these commitments are for less than a year in duration and are principally focused on the construction of new retail stores and the procurement of inventory 
we typically commit to construction costs one to six months in advance of a new retail store opening 
preliminary commitments with our private label merchandise vendors typically are made five to seven months in advance of planned receipt date 
initial merchandise commitments for branded merchandise typically are made four to six months before planned receipt date 
most of our retail store leases contain provisions that allow for early termination of the lease by either party if certain predetermined annual sales levels are not met 
generally  these provisions allow the lease to be terminated between the third and fifth year of the lease 
should the lease be terminated under these provisions  the unamortized portion of any landlord allowances related to that property would be payable to the landlord 
at december   we recorded an impairment charge of  to write off the carrying value of the assets associated with one of our retail stores 
we have the option to terminate the lease associated with this store lease in currently  we have no plan to close the store and are in negotiations with the landlord to mitigate the future operating costs of the store 
our sources of cash include cash on hand of million  available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility of million and anticipated cash flow from operations 
if the current trend of business continues  we expect to fund our entire retail store rollout in fiscal with cash generated from operations during fiscal we estimate that approximately million in cash  before landlord allowances  will be invested in property and equipment during fiscal  primarily for retail store construction 
based on current operating conditions  we believe we have sufficient sources of cash to execute our operating plans 
should current operating conditions deteriorate  we may generate less cash flow from operating activities than expected and be required to use more of our cash on hand than planned 
in addition  we may need to borrow on our revolving credit facility 
we believe that we have some flexibility to adjust our mid to long term operating plans to respond to any significant decrease in our cash resources 
for example  we could adjust the timing and extent of our retail store rollout for fiscal and beyond or change our catalog circulation strategy 
future financial targets for the first quarter of fiscal  we currently expect net sales and diluted earnings per share to come in at the lower end of our previously announced targets of to million in net sales and to in diluted earnings per share 
regarding our previously announced fiscal targets of growth in net sales and a increase in diluted earnings per share  given the significant geopolitical situation and the continued difficult economic environment we are not now in a position to affirm or disavow these targets 
these are our targets  not predictions of actual performance 
historically  our performance has deviated  often materially  from our targets 
see the first paragraph of this item for factors that might cause such deviations 
critical accounting policies in the normal course of business  we provide for markdown reserves on our overstocked merchandise 
we look at past and projected sales performance and inventory on hand and on order when calculating an expected level of overstocks 
based on the estimated level of overstocks and the estimated net realizable amount of the overstocks  we accrue a markdown provision and maintain markdown reserves in order to state our inventory at the lower of cost or market 
we have internal and external liquidation vehicles that we utilize to liquidate our overstocks 
internal channels  including sales catalogs  price reductions in the retail stores and our four outlet stores generally require lower markdown provisions and are considered first 
after the internal capacity is exceeded  external channels are considered 
external channels include inventory liquidators 
the amount of markdown provision is usually greater for external channels 
if our estimate of required markdown reserves is not accurate our gross margin and inventory balances may be overstated or understated 
we record accruals for estimated product returns for direct segment sales using the following process 
first  we determine an appropriate return rate for each current catalog 
in doing so  we consider a number of factors  including prior years and prior seasons return rates for comparable j 
jill catalogs  trends in return rates from season to season and within the current season and applicable operational factors 
once a return rate is determined  it is monitored and updated periodically as appropriate to reflect changes in underlying assumptions based on actual experience 
the return rate is used to calculate an appropriate returns allowance for the applicable catalog for the applicable period 
we also provide a returns allowance for our retail stores 
we provide this allowance based on projected merchandise returns  taking into consideration historical experience and other factors 
these returns allowances are recorded as a reduction to net sales for the estimated retail value of the projected merchandise returns and as a reduction in cost of products for the corresponding cost amount 
if our estimated returns allowance is not accurate  our returns reserves may be understated or overstated resulting in an overstatement or understatement  respectively  of sales 
we incur costs to produce  print and distribute our catalogs 
catalog costs are considered direct response advertising and as such are capitalized as incurred and amortized over the expected sales life of each catalog  which is generally a period not exceeding six months 
creative costs for a season  which will benefit multiple catalogs  are allocated to each catalog taking into consideration relative catalog size and circulation 
the amortization of our catalog costs is meant to match revenues with expenses 
the expected sales life of each catalog is determined based on a detailed marketing forecast  which considers historical experience for similar catalogs as well as current sales trends 
these forecasts are updated frequently during the most active period of selling for each catalog to determine the expected future life of the catalog 
we monitor changes to the forecast and adjust the amortization period accordingly 
if our calculation of the amortization period is incorrect  this could result in a mismatch of revenue and expenses in a particular period

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our objective in managing our long term exposure to interest rate changes and foreign currency rate changes is to limit the material impact of the changes on cash flows and earnings and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve our objectives  we periodically identify these risks and manage them through our regular operating and financing activities  including periodic refinancing of debt obligations to increase availability while minimizing financing costs and considering fixed and variable rate debt positions 
we do not currently use derivative financial instruments or enter into foreign currency denominated contracts 
we have calculated the effect of a change in interest rates over a month and determined the effect to be immaterial 
we do not foresee or expect any significant changes in the management of foreign currency or interest rate exposures or in the strategies we employ to manage such exposures in the near future 
we have established a trust in connection with our deferred compensation plan 
the trust assets are invested in corporate owned life insurance in a manner that is designed to approximate the measurement designation of the plan participants  for both vested and unvested balances 
investments are exposed to various risks  such as interest rate  market and credit risks 
due to the level of risk associated with certain investments  it is at least reasonably possible that changes in the values of these investments will occur in the near term and that such changes will also impact participant deferred compensation balances based on the measurement designations made by the participant 
changes in value of the trust assets are intended to mirror changes in the value of the participants deferred compensation accounts
