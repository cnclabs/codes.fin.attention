item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the discussion and analysis presented below has been prepared giving retroactive effect to the pooling of interests business combination with bindley on february  the discussion and analysis presented below refers to and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this form k 
general the company has four operating business segments pharmaceutical distribution and provider services  medical products and services  pharmaceutical technologies and services and automation and information services 
see part i  item  business  and note in notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of these segments 
results of operations operating revenue percent of company growth operating revenues years ended june  pharmaceutical distribution and provider services medical products and services pharmaceutical technologies and services automation and information services total company growth is calculated as the change increase or decrease in the operating revenue for a given year as a percentage of the operating revenue in the immediately preceding year 
total operating revenue increased and during fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in fiscal resulted from a higher sales volume across each of the company s segments  strong sales of self manufactured products  the addition of new products  the addition of new customers  some of which was a result of new corporate agreements with health care providers  and pharmaceutical price increases averaging approximately 
in addition  the syncor acquisition within the pharmaceutical technologies and services segment accounted for approximately of the overall growth of the company during fiscal the overall growth was partially offset by a decline within the company s non core wholesaler to wholesaler pharmaceutical trading business  as further discussed below 
the increase in fiscal resulted from a higher sales volume across various customer segments  strong sales of self manufactured products  pharmaceutical price increases averaging approximately  addition of new products  and the addition of new customers  some of which was a result of new corporate agreements with health care providers 
the pharmaceutical distribution and provider services segment s operating revenue growth in fiscal resulted from strong sales to customers within this segment s core pharmaceutical distribution business  some of which were generated from the addition of new contracts 
the most significant growth was in the alternate site and chain pharmacy businesses  which yielded growth of approximately and  respectively 
the chain pharmacy growth rate would have been stronger had it not experienced a reduction in business with kmart due to kmart s closure of various stores in connection with kmart s bankruptcy 
the overall growth rate in this segment was also negatively impacted by the lack of availability of certain pharmaceutical products from manufacturers  particularly in the second half of the fiscal year  which impacted non core wholesaler to wholesaler revenue 
this lack of availability was  in part  brought about by changes in inventory supply chain management policies of certain vendors  leading to the use of inventory management agreements 
inventory management agreements generally provide for the company to be compensated on a negotiated basis to help manufacturers better match their shipments to meet market demand  thereby resulting in less surplus inventory for the company s trading business 
it is not anticipated that fluctuations in trading activity will have a significant impact on operating revenue growth rates in future years 
the increase in this segment s operating revenue in fiscal resulted from strong sales to all customer segments  especially retail pharmacy and grocery chains and alternate site customers  each of which yielded growth  as well as strong growth in mail order and government customers 
a portion of the fiscal growth was attributable to pharmaceutical price increases and the addition of new contracts 
the medical products and services segment s operating revenue growth in fiscal resulted from increased sales of both distributed and self manufactured products 
the addition of several new contracts with hospitals and health care networks  as well as increased market share in the growing surgery center market contributed to increased sales of distributed and self manufactured products 
increased demand for certain existing self manufactured products  including medical gloves  medi vac r suction canisters  procedure based delivery system r kits and other minor procedure trays  accounted for a portion of this segment s revenue growth 
the addition of new  self manufactured products also contributed to the overall revenue growth in this segment 
some examples of these new  self manufactured products include the esteem r surgeon gloves and the tiburon tm and astound tm fabrics within the converters r business 
the increase in this segment s operating revenue in fiscal resulted from strong sales of self manufactured products  particularly sales of surgical instruments and custom kits for surgical procedures  as well as price increases and increases in sales of distributed products 
several new long term contracts were signed within the segment s distribution business in fiscal the pharmaceutical technologies and services segment s operating revenue growth in fiscal resulted from increased demand within the oral technologies  biotechnology and sterile life sciences  and packaging services businesses  and from acquisitions  primarily syncor 
product sales that showed particular strength within these businesses included lilly s zyprexa r zydis r  an anti psychotic  mylan s amnesteem tm  a generic drug for the treatment of acne  and sepracor s xoponex r  a respiratory drug 
the growth within the biotechnology and sterile life sciences business was negatively impacted by the planned shutdown for twelve weeks of a domestic sterile manufacturing facility to expand capacity 
the acquisition of syncor  effective january   contributed to the growth in this segment 
excluding syncor  this segment experienced revenue growth in the high teens during fiscal the increase in this segment s operating revenue in fiscal resulted from higher sales volume particularly involving development and analytical services  pharmaceutical technologies  and its proprietary packaging offerings 
products that showed particular strength were abbott s kaletra r  an aids product  lilly s zyprexa r zydis r  and pharmacia s detrol r la  an incontinence medication 
accelerating demand for sterile liquid and controlled release technologies  in addition to the acquisition of sp pharmaceuticals  was a significant contributor to the growth in fiscal within the pharmaceutical technologies business 
the completion of the magellan acquisition during the fourth quarter of fiscal contributed to the growth in the analytical services business 
excluding the revenues of sp pharmaceuticals and magellan  operating revenues grew approximately in fiscal over fiscal additionally  the segment experienced growth in fiscal in its pharmaceutical packaging business  which was attributable to the addition of several new customers and increased volume from existing customers 
slowing sales in the protease inhibitor and health and nutritional product lines partially offset the growth in this segment during fiscal the automation and information services segment s operating revenue growth in fiscal resulted from strong sales of new and existing patient safety and supply management product lines  including pyxis medstation r  pyxis anesthesia system tm  pyxis connect tm and pyxis supplystation r 
the increase in this segment s operating revenue in fiscal primarily resulted from strong sales in the patient safety and supply management product lines  such as pyxis medstation r sn and pyxis supplystation significant sales of new products including pyxis anesthesia system and products within the pyxis supplystation line also contributed to this segment s growth 
bulk deliveries to customer warehouses and other the pharmaceutical distribution and provider services segment reports bulk deliveries made to customers warehouses as revenue 
these sales involve the company acting as an intermediary in the ordering and subsequent delivery of pharmaceutical products 
fluctuations in bulk deliveries result largely from circumstances that the company cannot control  including consolidation within the customers industries  decisions by customers to either begin or discontinue warehousing activities and changes in policies by manufacturers related to selling directly to customers 
due to the lack of margin generated through bulk deliveries  fluctuations in their amount have no significant impact on the company s net earnings 
the pharmaceutical technologies and services segment records out of pocket reimbursements received through its sales and marketing services business as revenue 
these out of pocket expenses  which generally include travel expenses and other incidental costs  are incurred to fulfill the services required by the contract 
within these contracts  the customer agrees to reimburse the company for the expenses 
due to the company not generating any margin from these reimbursements  fluctuations in their amount have no impact on the company s net earnings 
gross margin as a percentage of operating revenue years ended june  pharmaceutical distribution and provider services medical products and services pharmaceutical technologies and services automation and information services total company the overall gross margin as a percentage of operating revenue decreased in fiscal and due to the mix of businesses contributing to the consolidated gross margin 
the decrease in gross margin as a percentage of operating revenue within the pharmaceutical distribution and provider services segment in fiscal resulted primarily from the following an increase in sales to lower margin customers which have a lower cost of distribution that reduced gross margins  competitive pricing  and a moderation in vendor margins due to manufacturers attempting to better match their shipments to meet market demand  resulting in less surplus inventory see additional discussion of these factors below 
a decrease in gross margin as a percentage of operating revenue within pharmaceutical technologies and services also contributed to the overall decrease 
the decrease in the overall gross margin as a percentage of operating revenue in fiscal resulted from a greater mix of lower margin pharmaceutical distribution operating revenues as compared to the prior year 
the pharmaceutical distribution and provider services segment represented of operating revenues in fiscal  up from in fiscal the decline in the gross margins in the medical products and services and automation and information services segments also contributed to the overall decline in the company s gross margin in fiscal the gross margin as a percentage of operating revenue in the pharmaceutical distribution and provider services segment decreased in fiscal this decrease in gross margin as a percentage of operating revenue primarily resulted from an increase in sales to lower margin customers which include chain pharmacy and alternate site which have a lower cost of distribution 
the table below shows the percentage breakdown of operating revenue by customer class within pharmaceutical distribution  the largest business within this segment  for fiscal years  and customer class chain pharmacy alternate site health system independent total this segment s selling margins were negatively impacted by competitive pricing  which was another primary cause of the decrease in gross margin as a percentage of operating revenue 
a moderation in vendor margin programs also contributed to the decline in this segment s gross margin as a percentage of operating revenue 
the company has seen changes in vendor supply chain management policies related to product availability  including the use of inventory management agreements 
under these types of agreements  the company is generally compensated on a negotiated basis to help manufacturers better match their shipments with market demand  therefore adversely affecting the company s investment margin opportunities 
generally  the company is compensated under its inventory management agreements based on the timing of inventory price increases and the volume of inventory purchases during the agreed upon period 
the company recognizes the amounts received from such agreements within gross margin based upon related inventory sales 
the gross margins in the pharmaceutical distribution and provider services segment may be affected in future years by changes occurring in the industry  such as changes in vendor supply chain management policies  including the use of inventory management agreements 
these changes provide fewer opportunities for the pharmaceutical distribution business within the pharmaceutical distribution and provider services segment to make large purchases of product with related vendor margin incentives 
with fewer opportunities to make attractive inventory investments  the company expects to deploy less capital in this segment 
the decline in gross margin as a percentage of operating revenue in the pharmaceutical distribution and provider services segment in fiscal resulted primarily from the highly competitive market within the pharmaceutical distribution industry and a greater mix of high volume customers where a lower cost of distribution and better asset management enabled the company to offer lower selling margins to its customers see table above 
in addition  this segment s gross margin in fiscal was negatively impacted by several non recurring items  primarily related to the bindley integration 
in fiscal  the company incurred a one time inventory adjustment related to the process of closing and rationalizing facilities in addition to the integration of the operations of bindley into this segment 
these decreases in fiscal were partially offset by higher vendor margins from favorable price increases and manufacturer marketing programs 
the gross margin as a percentage of operating revenue in the medical products and services segment remained unchanged in fiscal this segment s gross margin was positively impacted by increased sales of existing and new higher margin  self manufactured products  manufacturing efficiencies achieved during the fiscal year and outsourcing of some product manufacturing to more cost efficient areas 
the impact of new distribution agreements which increased sales of lower margin distributed products offset the gains noted above 
the decline in gross margin as a percentage of operating revenue in this segment in fiscal resulted primarily from competitive pricing pressures on distributed products 
this decline was partially offset by manufacturing productivity improvements and a higher sales volume of self manufactured products which carry significantly higher gross margins than other portions of this segment s business 
the gross margin as a percentage of operating revenue in the pharmaceutical technologies and services segment decreased during fiscal this decrease was primarily driven by the addition of syncor s nuclear pharmacy services business 
syncor has a slightly lower gross margin ratio than the other businesses within this segment 
also  the gross margin was negatively impacted by certain items that occurred in fiscal that did not recur in fiscal  including the recording of pricing adjustments related to the minimum recovery expected to be received for claims against vitamin manufacturers for amounts overcharged in prior years also  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
these pricing adjustments were recorded as a reduction of cost of goods sold  consistent with the classification of the original overcharge  and were based on the minimum amounts estimated to be recoverable based on the facts and circumstances available at the time they were recorded 
the company recorded million in the first quarter of fiscal and million in the second quarter of fiscal for these pricing adjustments 
this segment s gross margin as a percentage of operating revenue increased during fiscal this increase was primarily due to a larger mix of higher margin pharmaceutical products versus health and nutritional products  as well as cost efficiencies due to infrastructure investments at manufacturing facilities 
this increase was partially offset by the impact of certain items that occurred in fiscal which did not recur in fiscal  namely revenues related to the use of certain of the company s proprietary technology 
the gross margin as a percentage of operating revenue in the automation and information services segment increased in fiscal  primarily from the mix of products sold as well as productivity gains realized from the operational improvements implemented in the prior fiscal year 
this segment s gross margin as a percentage of operating revenue decreased in fiscal  primarily due to changes in its product mix 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of operating revenue years ended june  pharmaceutical distribution and provider services medical products and services pharmaceutical technologies and services automation and information services total company in fiscal  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of operating revenue include goodwill amortization 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of operating revenue declined in fiscal and fiscal this decline reflects ongoing productivity programs and economies of scale associated with the company s revenue growth 
significant productivity gains resulting from continued cost control efforts in all segments and the continuation of consolidation and selective automation of operating facilities contributed to the improvement 
in addition  the company is continuing to take advantage of synergies from recent acquisitions to decrease selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of operating revenue 
the improvement in fiscal was partially offset by an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of operating revenue in the pharmaceutical technologies and services segment  primarily the result of changes within the business mix in this segment 
this business mix change was largely driven by the acquisition of syncor  which has a higher expense ratio as compared to other businesses in this segment 
in the first quarter of fiscal  the company ceased amortizing goodwill due to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion which also contributed to the improvement 
goodwill amortization expense in fiscal was approximately million 
in addition  during fiscal  the company realized productivity and operating efficiencies as a result of implementing changes within the automation and information services segment to better service its customers 
the selling  general and administrative expenses grew and in fiscal years and  respectively 
expenses from the operations of newly acquired companies accounted for approximately of the overall increase in fiscal  with expenses relating to the operations of syncor giving rise to the largest part of the increase 
the increase in fiscal was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs  which accounted for approximately of the overall increase 
the overall increase in fiscal and fiscal compares favorably to the and growth in operating revenue for the same periods

manufacturing facility closures restructurings 
during fiscal  and  the company recorded a total of million  million and million  respectively  as special charges related to the closure  consolidation and restructuring of certain manufacturing facilities 
these closures  consolidations and restructurings occurred within the medical products and services segment and the pharmaceutical technologies and services segment 
within the medical products and services segment  three manufacturing facility closures were completed during fiscal also  certain operations within three other facilities were identified for consolidation or rationalization 
a total of million was recorded related to these closures  consolidations and rationalizations  of which million related to severance costs due to the termination of approximately  employees 
approximately of the employees were terminated prior to june  the remaining employees are expected to be terminated during fiscal asset impairment charges of million were incurred 
also  exit costs of million were incurred  primarily related to dismantling and moving machinery and equipment 
the plans to consolidate or rationalize the three facilities discussed above are expected to be completed during fiscal the company incurred special charges of million related to the restructuring  consolidation or closure of three manufacturing facilities within the pharmaceutical technologies and services segment during fiscal one restructuring was completed during fiscal the other two consolidations closures are expected to be completed by september  asset impairment charges of million were incurred related to these closures

the remaining million primarily includes non employee related costs associated with certain restructuring activities initiated by the company outside of its manufacturing facilities 
litigation settlements  net 
during fiscal and  the company recorded income from net litigation settlements of million and million  respectively 
the settlements resulted primarily from the recovery of antitrust claims against certain vitamin manufacturers for amounts overcharged in prior years 
the total recovery through june  was million net of attorneys fees  payments due to other interested parties and expenses withheld 
of this total recovery  million and million were recorded as special items during fiscal and  respectively 
the remaining million had previously been recorded million in the second quarter of fiscal and million in the first quarter of fiscal and reflected as a reduction of cost of goods sold  consistent with the classification of the original overcharge  and were based on the minimum amounts estimated to be recoverable based on the facts and circumstances available at the time they were recorded 
while the company still has pending claims with smaller vitamin manufacturers  the total amount of future recovery is not currently estimable  but the company believes it is not likely to be a material amount 
any future recoveries will be recorded as a special item in the period in which a settlement is reached 
during fiscal  bindley recorded a benefit of approximately million related to a reduction in a litigation settlement accrual  which was previously recorded 
the amount of the final settlement was lower than originally anticipated 
summary in fiscal  the net effect of various special items reduced reported earnings from continuing operations by million to  million and reduced reported diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations by per share to per share 
in fiscal  the net effect of various special items reduced reported earnings before cumulative effect of change in accounting by million to  million see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for discussion on cumulative effect of change in accounting and reduced reported diluted earnings per common share before cumulative effect of change in accounting by per share to per share 
in fiscal  the net effect of various special charges reduced reported net earnings by million to million and reduced reported diluted earnings per common share by per share to per share 
certain merger and acquisition related and restructuring costs are based upon estimates 
actual amounts paid may ultimately differ from these estimates 
if additional costs are incurred or recorded amounts exceed costs  such changes in estimates will be recorded in special items when incurred 
the company estimates that it will incur additional costs associated with the various merger  acquisition and restructuring activities entered into to date totaling approximately million approximately million net of tax in future periods 
this estimate is subject to adjustment pending resolution of syncor acquisition related litigation contingencies 
additional discussion related to the company s merger transactions is included in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that it will incur these costs in order to properly integrate and rationalize operations  a portion of which represents facility rationalizations and implementing efficiencies with regard to  among other things  information systems  customer systems  marketing programs and administrative functions 
such amounts will be charged to expense when incurred 
the company s trend with regard to acquisitions has been to expand its role as a provider of services to the health care industry 
this trend has resulted in expansion into service areas which a complement the company s existing operations and b provide opportunities for the company to develop synergies with  and thus strengthen  the acquired business 
as the health care industry continues to change  the company continually evaluates possible candidates for merger or acquisition and intends to continue to seek opportunities to expand its role as a provider of services to the health care industry through all its reporting segments 
there can be no assurance that it will be able to successfully pursue any such opportunity or consummate any such transaction  if pursued 
if additional transactions are entered into or consummated  the company would incur additional merger and acquisition related costs  and there can be no assurance that the integration efforts associated with any such transaction would be successful 
interest expense and other 
the decrease in interest expense and other of million during fiscal compared to fiscal resulted from lower interest rates and effective asset management  resulting in lower average borrowings outstanding 
the decrease in interest expense and other of million during fiscal compared to fiscal was a result of lower interest rates on borrowings throughout the year and effective asset management  resulting in lower average borrowings outstanding 
in addition  in fiscal  the company recognized a one time gain on an equity investment  which contributed to the overall decline 
the company manages its exposure to changing interest rates using various hedging strategies see notes and in notes to consolidated financial statements 
provision for income taxes 
the provisions for income taxes relative to earnings before income taxes  discontinued operations and cumulative effect of change in accounting were of pretax earnings in fiscal compared with in fiscal and for fiscal the fluctuation in the tax rate is primarily due to changes within state and foreign effective tax rates resulting from the company s business mix and changes in the tax impact of special items  which may have unique tax implications 
in addition  effective july   the company ceased amortizing goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives 
this contributed to the decrease in the tax rate in fiscal as compared to fiscal critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that can have a significant impact on the presentation of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and that require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and management s judgment 
because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates  actual results may differ from these estimates 
below are those policies applied in preparing the company s financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions 
for additional accounting policies  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
trade receivables are primarily comprised of amounts owed to the company through its operating activities and are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company also provides financing to various customers 
such financing arrangements range from one year to ten years at interest rates that generally fluctuate with the prime rate 
the financings may be collateralized  guaranteed by third parties or unsecured 
finance notes and accrued interest receivable are recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts and are included in other assets 
extending credit terms and calculating the required allowance involve the use of a substantial amount of judgment by the company s management 
in determining the appropriate allowance  the company reviews the industry trends and the customer s financial strength  credit standing  and payment history to assess the probability of collection 
see schedule ii included in this form k which includes a rollforward of activity for these allowance reserves 
inventories 
a majority of inventories approximately in and in are stated at the lower of cost  using the last in  first out lifo method  or market  and are primarily merchandise inventories 
the remaining inventory is primarily stated at the lower of cost  using the first in  first out fifo method  or market 
if the company had used the fifo method of inventory valuation  which approximates current replacement cost  inventories would have been higher 
below is a reconciliation of fifo inventory to lifo inventory june  in millions fifo inventory    lifo reserve valuation total inventory    goodwill 
the company elected to adopt sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets beginning with the first quarter of fiscal under sfas no 
 purchased goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually 
accordingly  the company ceased amortization of all goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives as of july  intangible assets with finite lives  primarily customer relationships and patents and trademarks  continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
the company completed the required impairment testing in fiscal and and did not incur any impairment charges 
special charges 
the company primarily records costs that relate to the integration of previously acquired companies or costs of restructuring operations to improve productivity as special charges 
integration costs from acquisitions accounted for under the pooling of interests method have been recorded in accordance with eitf  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring and staff accounting bulletin no 
 restructuring and impairment charges 
certain costs related to these acquisitions  such as employee and lease terminations and other facility exit costs  were recognized at the date the integration plan was adopted by management 
certain other integration costs that did not meet the criteria for accrual at the commitment date have been expensed as the integration plan has been implemented 
the costs associated with integrating acquired companies under the purchase method are recorded in accordance with eitf  recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination 
certain costs to be incurred by the company  as the acquirer  such as employee and lease terminations and other facility exit costs  are recognized at the date the integration plan is formalized and adopted by management 
certain other integration costs that do not meet the criteria for accrual at the commitment date are expensed as the integration plan is implemented 
at the beginning of the third quarter of fiscal  the company implemented sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities to account for costs incurred in restructuring activities 
under this standard  a liability for an exit cost is recognized as incurred 
as discussed above  the company previously accounted for costs associated with restructuring activities under eitf  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring which required the company to recognize a liability for restructuring costs on the date of the commitment to an exit plan 
the majority of the special items incurred can be classified in one of the following categories employee related costs  exit costs including lease termination costs  asset impairments and other integration costs 
employee costs include severance and termination benefits 
lease termination costs include lease cancellation fees  forfeited deposits and remaining payments due under existing lease agreements less estimated sublease income 
other facility exit costs include costs to move equipment or inventory out of a facility as well as other costs incurred to shut down a facility 
asset impairment costs include the remaining net book value of assets no longer used as a result of the integration or restructuring activities 
other integration costs primarily include charges directly related to the integration plan such as consulting costs related to information systems and employee benefit plans as well as relocation and travel costs directly associated with the integration plan 
actual costs could differ from management s estimates 
if actual results are different from original estimates  the company will record additional expense or reverse previously recorded expenses 
these adjustments will be recorded as special charges 
liquidity and capital resources working capital increased to billion at june  from billion at june  this increase in working capital primarily resulted from increases in trade receivables and inventories of million and million  respectively 
the increase in trade receivables was driven by the company s revenue growth as well as the addition of syncor 
the increase in inventories resulted primarily from increased sales across each of the company s segments 
the increase in inventories noted above is less than in prior years due to the impact of branded to generic product conversions  vendor inventory policies  and the use of inventory management agreements  which lowered the company s inventory investment 
synergies realized from the bindley integration have also lowered the company s investment in inventory 
net investment in sales type leases decreased million at june   as compared to june  this decrease resulted primarily from the sale of sales type leases for amounts approximating their fair value  partially offset by new leases entered into during the fiscal year 
the net book value of the leases sold was approximately million see note in notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
shareholders equity increased to billion at june  from billion at june  the increase was primarily due to net earnings of  million  the issuance of shares held in treasury for the syncor acquisition totaling approximately million  the valuation of syncor vested options acquired of million and the investment of million by employees of the company through various stock incentive plans 
this increase in fiscal was partially offset by the repurchase of common shares of  million and dividends paid of million 
in january  the company s board of directors authorized the repurchase of common shares up to an aggregate amount of million 
pursuant to this authorization  the company repurchased approximately million common shares having an aggregate cost of approximately million 
this repurchase was completed in february  and the repurchased shares were placed into treasury shares to be used for general corporate purposes 
in august  the company s board of directors authorized the repurchase of common shares up to an aggregate amount of million 
pursuant to this authorization  the company repurchased approximately million common shares having an aggregate cost of approximately million 
this repurchase was completed in january  and the repurchased shares were placed into treasury shares to be used for general corporate purposes 
in september  the company s board of directors authorized the repurchase of common shares up to an aggregate amount of million 
pursuant to this authorization  the company repurchased approximately million common shares having an aggregate cost of approximately million 
this repurchase was completed in august  and the repurchased shares were placed into treasury shares to be used for general corporate purposes 
at june   the company had a commercial paper program providing for the issuance of up to billion in aggregate maturity value of commercial paper 
the company also had an extendible commercial notes program providing for the issuance of up to million of extendible commercial notes 
the company did not have any borrowings outstanding under these programs at june  the company has an unsecured bank credit facility providing for up to an aggregate of billion in borrowings of which million expires on march  and million expires on march  the facility expiring on march   allows the company  at its option  to extend the maturity of any moneys borrowed for up to one year 
at expiration  these facilities can be extended upon mutual consent of the company and the lending institutions 
this credit facility exists largely to support issuances of commercial paper as well as other short term borrowings and remained unused at june   except for million of standby letters of credit issued on behalf of the company 
the company also has uncommitted short term credit facilities with various bank sources aggregating million 
at june   the company had borrowings outstanding related to these short term credit facilities of million
