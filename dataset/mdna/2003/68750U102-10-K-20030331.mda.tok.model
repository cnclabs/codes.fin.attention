item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements this discussion includes statements about future operations  potential timing of regulatory approvals  strategies  and financial results 
although we believe our assumptions are reasonable  they could be inaccurate 
our actual future revenues and income could differ materially from our expected results 
we have no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are based on estimates and assumptions that involve risks and uncertainties  many of which are beyond our control or are subject to change and include  without limitation  the risk factors described below in certain risks related to our business that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward looking statements 
critical accounting policies our discussions and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 
the preparation of financial statements requires us to make assumptions  estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including  but not limited to  those related to accounts receivable and inventories 
we use authoritative pronouncements  historical experience and other assumptions as the basis for making estimates 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue from product sales is recognized upon the receipt of a valid order and shipment to our distributor customers outside the us in the us  product sales revenue is recognized upon the receipt of a valid order and shipment of the product to the end user hospital 
we do not allow product returns or exchanges and we have no post shipment obligations to our customers 
in addition  collection of the customers receivable balance must be deemed probable 
both our us hospital customers and our distributor customers outside of the us are generally required to pay on a net day basis and sales discounts are not offered 
we maintain an accounts receivable allowance for an estimated amount of losses that may result from a customer s inability to pay for product purchased 
if the financial condition of our customers was to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market value using the first in first out basis  or fifo  method 
if market value declines  we would write down our inventory  if necessary  by estimating the potential for future loss based on a variety of factors  including the quantity of particular items  its prospect for replacement or obsolescence and its remaining shelf life 
if actual market conditions were to be less favorable than those projected by management and demand decreased  inventory write downs could be required 
as of december   we have not needed to write down our inventory 
revenue interest obligation during october  we completed a  product development and equity financing with paul capital royalty acquisition fund  lp paul royalty 
in this financing  we sold paul royalty a revenue interest and  shares of our common stock 
the value of these shares at the time the transaction closed was per share  or  in the aggregate 
the net proceeds from the financing were first allocated to the fair value of the common stock on the date of the transaction  and the  remainder of the net proceeds was allocated to the revenue interest obligation 
on march   we amended the original financing  which resulted in a one time increase to the revenue interest obligation of  which made the balance of the revenue interest obligation  as of december  pursuant to the march amendment  paul royalty surrendered to us  shares of our common stock that it had originally purchased in the october financing 
in exchange  we surrendered our right to receive credits against the revenue interest obligation 
the value of the surrendered shares of our common stock on march  was per share  or  in the aggregate 
the march amendment also provided for a reduction in the amount required for us to repurchase paul royalty s revenue interest  if a repurchase event was to occur 
this modification was accounted for as a treasury stock transaction with a decrease to shareholders equity and an increase to the revenue interest obligation based upon the fair market value of the common stock on the date of the modification 
since this represents a non monetary transaction  we utilized the fair market value of our common stock surrendered by paul royalty on march   or  to determine the fair value of the non monetary consideration 
this approach is in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
accounting for nonmonetary transactions apb 
the treasury stock was then retired in september the products that are subject to the revenue interest have only recently been approved and marketed or are still under development 
for these reasons  as of december  and for the foreseeable future  we cannot currently make a reasonable estimate of future revenues and payments that may become due to paul royalty under this financing 
therefore  it is premature to estimate the expected impact of this financing on our results of operations  liquidity and financial position 
future sales from vitoss in the us and vitoss and cortoss in europe  our approved products  are difficult to estimate 
rhakoss is under development with human clinical trials initiated in europe in april we have initiated  or plan to initiate  human clinical trials for cortoss and rhakoss in the us there is no assurance that the data from these clinical trials will result in obtaining the necessary approval to sell cortoss in the us or rhakoss in either the us or europe 
even if such approval is obtained  future revenue levels  if any  are difficult to estimate 
accordingly  given these uncertainties in and for the foreseeable future  we will charge revenue interest expense as revenues subject to the revenue interest obligation are recognized 
we will continue to monitor our product sales levels 
once we are able to make a reasonable estimate of our related revenue interest obligation  interest expense will be charged based upon the interest method and the obligation will be reduced as principal payments are made 
the actual impact has been the payment of approximately  and  in revenue interest payments during the years ended december  and  respectively 
the revenue interest payments under this agreement are treated as interest expense in accordance with eitf income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 

sfas no 
is an asset and liability approach requiring the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns 
sfas no 
requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recorded without consideration as to their realizability 
the deferred tax asset includes the cumulative temporary differences related to certain research  patent and organizational costs  which have been charged to expense in our statements of operations contained in this form k but have been recorded as assets for federal tax return purposes 
these tax assets are amortized over periods generally ranging from to years for federal tax purposes 
the portion of any deferred tax asset  for which it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized  must then be offset by recording a valuation allowance against the asset 
a valuation allowance has been established against all of our deferred tax assets since  given our history of operating losses  the realization of the deferred tax asset is not assured

preferred stock in july  we sold  shares of series a preferred stock at  per share together with five year warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at per share  for net cash proceeds of  the  shares of series a preferred stock are convertible into  shares of common stock 
in connection with this transaction  after obtaining the required shareholder approval in october  we sold on the same terms and conditions as in the july closing  an additional shares of series a preferred stock together with warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at per share  for net cash proceeds of  these shares of series a preferred stock are convertible into  shares of our common stock 
for each series a preferred stock closing  the respective proceeds were allocated to the series a preferred stock and the warrants based on the relative fair values of each instrument 
the fair value of the warrants issued  in both july and october  were determined based on an independent third party valuation 
accordingly  approximately  of the july proceeds was allocated to the series a preferred stock and  of the proceeds was allocated to the warrants 
similarly   of the october proceeds was allocated to the series a preferred stock and  of the proceeds was allocated to the warrants 
in addition  in accordance with eitf issue no 
 application of issue no 
to certain convertible instruments  eitf no 
the issuance costs were not offset against the proceeds received in the issuance in calculating the intrinsic value of the conversion option but were considered in the calculation of the amount shown on the consolidated balance sheets 
after considering the allocation of the proceeds based on the relative fair values  it was determined that the series a preferred stock has a beneficial conversion feature bcf in accordance with eitf issue no 
 accounting for convertible securities with beneficial conversion features or contingently adjustable conversion ratios eitf no 
and eitf no 
accordingly  a bcf adjustment of  was recorded  with respect to the series a preferred stock at the july closing 
the value of the bcf was recorded in a manner similar to a deemed dividend  and since the series a preferred stock has no maturity date and is convertible at the date of issuance  the bcf was fully amortized through retained earnings during the third quarter of additionally  we recorded a similar deemed dividend charge during the fourth quarter of of  for the bcf with respect to the series a preferred stock sold at the october closing 
in addition for the year ended december   we recorded approximately  in dividend accretion related to the higher dividend rates applicable to the series a preferred stock for periods beginning after june  in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 increasing rate preferred stock sab  and we recorded a one time  non cash charge of approximately  that represents a deemed dividend relating to the intrinsic value of the bcf of the series a preferred stock 
given the substantial value associated with the warrants and the related bcf  the total dividend attributed to holders of the series a preferred stock during consisted of the bcf of   in the third quarter of and  in the fourth quarter of and the stated preferred dividend of totaling  we consider the quarterly reporting period in which the bcf was recognized to be appropriately excludable from the period of dividend attribution as described in sab  since the third quarter of already included a disproportionate dividend attribution  due to the bcf on the july closing we commenced recognition of the implied discount addressed in sab in the fourth quarter of and recorded an additional  of dividends to reflect the sab discount 
similarly  for the october closing  no additional dividend was recorded pursuant to sab as the fourth quarter of included the bcf for the october closing 
the sab discount relating to the october closing will begin to be recorded in the first quarter of assuming that the series a preferred stock remains outstanding  we expect the sab additional dividend to be approximately  in   in and  in liquidity and capital resources we have experienced negative operating cash flows since our inception  and we have funded our operations primarily from the proceeds received from sales of our stock 
cash and cash equivalents increased  from december  to due primarily to proceeds received from the sale of series a preferred stock 
as of december  and  cash  cash equivalents and short term investments consisted of the following gross gross unrealized unrealized fair market original cost gains losses value december  cash and cash equivalents   short term investments   percentage of total assets december  cash and cash equivalents   short term investments percentage of total assets we invest excess cash in highly liquid investment grade marketable securities including corporate commercial paper and us government agency bonds 
the following is a summary of selected cash flow information year ended december  net cash used in operating activities    net cash used in provided by investing activities    net cash provided by financing activities    effects of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents    net increase in cash and cash equivalents    net cash used in operating activities operating cash inflows operating cash inflows for have been derived primarily from vitoss and imbibe product sales in the us and vitoss  cortoss and aliquot product sales in europe 
we have also received cash inflows from interest income on cash equivalents and short term investments 
operating cash inflows for were derived primarily from vitoss product sales in the us and europe and interest income on cash equivalents and short term investments 
operating cash outflows our operating cash outflows have continued to be primarily used for development  manufacturing scale up qualification  pre clinical and clinical activities in preparation for regulatory filings of our products in development 
in addition  funds have been used for the production of inventory  increase in sales and marketing staffing  development of marketing materials and payment of sales commissions related to the commercialization of vitoss and cortoss products 
operating cash flow requirements outlook we do not expect to receive fda approval for the sale of cortoss and rhakoss in the us for the next several years  if at all 
accordingly  we expect to focus our efforts on sales growth under our vitoss product line during that period through the extension of product configurations under our vitoss product line  continued training and education of surgeons and improvements to our distribution channels 
however  our efforts to grow sales and reduce our losses are subject to certain risks related to our business  which are described in detail below 
accordingly  we do not expect sales to generate cash flow in excess of operating expenses for at least the next couple of years  if at all 
we expect to continue to use cash  cash equivalents and short term investments to fund operating activities 
in europe  we began selling vitoss in the fourth quarter of  cortoss for screw augmentation procedures in the fourth quarter of  aliquot in the third quarter of and cortoss for vertebral augmentation procedures in the first quarter of in the us  we began selling vitoss in the first quarter of and imbibe in the third quarter of future cash flow levels from vitoss  cortoss  imbibe and aliquot product sales are difficult to predict  and product sales to date may not be indicative of future sales levels 
vitoss  cortoss and aliquot sales levels in europe may fluctuate due to the timing of any distributor stocking orders and may experience seasonal slowdowns during the summer months 
sales of vitoss and imbibe in the us may fluctuate due to the timing of orders from hospitals 
there may be future quarterly fluctuations in spending 
we expect sales commission expense may increase at a higher rate in than any increase in vitoss product sales in the us in addition  we expect increases in the use of cash to fund receivables and inventory for vitoss product line extensions 
we also expect to continue to use cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at a rate comparable to that for in operating activities associated with research and development  including product development for our vitoss product line extensions  clinical trials in the us for cortoss and rhakoss  and marketing activities in support of our other products under development as well as the associated marketing and sales activities with vitoss and imbibe in the us and vitoss  cortoss and aliquot outside the us we expect our dividends will increase in future years 
the dividend rate on each share of series a preferred stock is per year on the  stated value of the series a preferred stock 
however  commencing after june   for the series a preferred stock still outstanding and not converted into common stock  the dividend rate will increase each quarter by an additional two percentage points  up to a maximum dividend rate of per year 
in addition  in the event that the series a preferred stock becomes subject to mandatory conversion due to our achievement of certain revenue targets prior to july   we will pay an additional dividend equal to the difference between x  per share of series a preferred stock to be converted and y the sum of all dividends that have been paid and all accrued but unpaid dividends with respect to each such share 
finally  we have entered into and may enter additional financing arrangements where we pay revenue sharing amounts on the sales of certain products 
revenue sharing arrangements can increase expenses related to the sale of our products 
in addition  beginning in  and during the term of the paul royalty revenue interest agreement  we are required to make advance payments on the revenue interest obligation at the beginning of each year 
in january  we paid to paul royalty the required  advance payment in respect of net sales of our vitoss and cortoss products 
the amount of the advance payment increases to  in  and further increases to  in the years through while we believe that we will have sufficient cash at the end of to make the required  advance payment to paul royalty during  we cannot be certain that we will have sufficient cash to meet our advance payment obligations for the years through while the advance payments will impact cash flow within a given year  they will not affect earnings as the advance payments are credited within each year against the revenue interest actually earned by paul royalty during that year  with any excess advance payments refunded to us shortly after the end of the year 
net cash used in provided by investing activities we have invested  and  for the year ended december  and  respectively  primarily for the purchase of manufacturing and research and development equipment in order to support our product development and manufacturing capabilities 
during the twelve months ended december    was used for the net purchase of investment grade marketable securities 
during the same period in   was provided by the net sale of investment grade marketable securities 
during march   of restricted cash was released from escrow that had been established in connection with the sale of the biogran dental grafting product line to i in march investing cash outlook we expect the rate at which we invest funds in related to the purchase of capital equipment to be relatively stable compared to net cash provided by financing activities during  we received  from stock option and warrant exercises and purchases of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
in addition during   and  were used to repay capital lease obligations and notes payable  respectively  and we received  as proceeds from notes payable 
during  we received  from stock option and warrant exercises and purchases of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
in addition   was used to repay capital lease obligations and  was used for the repayment of notes payable during during  we sold  shares of our common stock in a private equity financing 
the aggregate consideration we received for these shares consisted of  in cash  plus the surrender and cancellation of outstanding warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock 
additionally during  we completed a product development and equity financing in which we sold a revenue interest and  shares of our common stock 
the common stock was recorded at its gross market value of   net of expenses and a revenue interest obligation related to the revenue interest of  was recorded 
during  we entered into a development and distribution agreement and with this arrangement  we sold  shares of common stock at per share  raising net proceeds of  additionally during  we sold  shares of our common stock at per share in two private equity financings raising net proceeds of  in addition during  we sold  shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share raising net proceeds of  series a preferred stock in july  we sold  shares of series a preferred stock at  per share together with five year warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at per share  for net cash proceeds of  the  shares of series a preferred stock are convertible into  shares of our common stock 
additionally  in july  we issued to the designees of the placement agent for the transaction  five year warrants to purchase an aggregate  shares of our common stock at per share which were valued at  in connection with this transaction  after obtaining the required shareholder approval in october  we sold on the same terms and conditions as in the july closing  an additional shares of series a preferred stock together with warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at per share  for net cash proceeds of  the shares of series a preferred stock are convertible into  shares of our common stock 
in connection with the october sale  we issued to the placement agent s designees additional five year warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at per share which were valued at  financing requirements outlook the extent and timing of proceeds from future stock option and warrant exercises  if any  are primarily dependent upon our common stock s market price  as well as the exercise prices and expiration dates of the stock options and warrants 
we do not expect sales to generate cash flow in excess of operating expenses for at least the next several years  if at all 
we expect to continue to use cash  cash equivalents and short term investments to fund operating and investing activities 
we believe our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of approximately  as of december  will be sufficient to meet our currently estimated operating and investing requirements at least through the first quarter of however  there is no assurance that we will not seek to obtain additional funds through equity or debt financings or strategic alliances with third parties either alone or in combination with equity 
these equity or debt financings could result in substantial dilution to our shareholders or require debt service and or revenue sharing arrangements 
any such required financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us 
in addition  if the bid price per share of our common stock is below per share  we may need to raise additional funds by the fourth quarter of to meet the nasdaq national market s continuing listing requirements 
results of operations this section should be read in conjunction with the detailed discussion under liquidity and capital resources 
as described therein  we expect to continue to incur significant operating losses in the future as we continue our product development efforts 
comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  product sales 
product sales for the year ended december  were approximately  compared to approximately  for the year ended december  product sales for consisted primarily of vitoss and imbibe sales in the us  as well as vitoss  cortoss and aliquot sales outside the us product sales for consisted primarily of vitoss sales in the us  as well as vitoss sales in europe  australia and israel and cortoss sales in europe during the fourth quarter of information regarding our product sales by geographic market for each of the fiscal years ended december   and is included in note product sales to the consolidated financial statements 
gross profit 
our gross profit for the year ended december  and was approximately  and  respectively  or and of product sales  respectively 
the improved gross profit margin for in comparison to is a result of a higher proportion of sales from the us during where the average selling price is higher in comparison to outside of the us operating expenses 
operating expenses for the year ended december  were approximately  compared to approximately  for general administrative expenses for the year ended december  were higher than the same period in primarily due to increased costs for property and casualty insurance and severance

gross profit 
our gross profit for the year ended december  and was approximately  and  respectively  or and of product sales  respectively 
biogran cost of sales was approximately  or a gross profit margin for the year ended december  all of the vitoss sold in europe during was produced prior the receipt of its ce certification in july in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for research and development costs  the costs of producing that material was recorded as research and development expense prior to july rather than capitalized into inventory as was the case for periods after ce certification was obtained 
accordingly  the costs of producing that material are not reflected in cost of sales 
this inventory was primarily sold in and was not a material factor that impacted gross margins realized on vitoss sales in accordingly  vitoss cost of sales for the year ended december  of  is not indicative of margins to be realized in future periods 
variations in the gross margins realized on vitoss sales subsequent to were primarily due to i changes in the proportion of sales in europe to our stocking distributors  where vitoss gross margins are lower in comparison to sales in the us to our end user hospitals  and ii changes in our average selling price 
operating expenses 
operating expenses for the year ended december  were approximately  compared to approximately  for general administrative expenses for the twelve months ended december   were comparable to the same period in selling and marketing expenses for the same twelve month periods from to increased as a result of commission expense paid to the independent commissioned sales agencies in the us on vitoss product sales  increased staffing and other spending related to the support of product sales

other income expense 
net other income includes interest income  interest expense and revenue interest expense 
we recorded approximately  of net other income for the year ended december  compared to approximately  of net other income for the year ended december  the decrease in net other income between and is attributed to lower average interest rates earned on invested cash and revenue interest expense in as a result of the arrangement with paul royalty 
net gain on sale of product line

for the foreseeable future  we cannot make a reasonable estimate of future revenues and the related revenue interest payable to paul royalty 
assumes shares of series a preferred stock outstanding as of december  remain outstanding  and are not converted to common stock  for the periods reported 
dividends are payable in either cash or common stock  at our election 
to date  all dividends have been paid in common stock 
leases 
we lease office space and equipment under non cancelable operating leases 
for the years ended december   and  lease expense was approximately   and  respectively 
as of december   future minimum rent payments through the expiration of these leases are approximately  in   in   in   in   in  and  in and thereafter 
revenue interest 
during october  we completed a  product development and equity financing with paul royalty 
in this financing  we sold paul royalty a revenue interest and  shares of our common stock for gross proceeds of  the revenue interest provides for paul royalty to receive on the first  of annual sales plus of annual sales in excess of  of our vitoss  cortoss and rhakoss products in north america and europe through  subject to certain adjustments 
our obligation to pay the revenue interest is secured by our licenses  patents and trademarks relating to certain of our products  including vitoss  cortoss and rhakoss in north america and europe 
as of december   we were in compliance with all financial covenants 
however  if we fail to maintain the specified financial covenants  paul royalty can demand that we repurchase its revenue interest 
in addition to the failure to comply with the specified financial covenants  the occurrence of certain events triggers paul royalty s right to require us to repurchase its revenue interest 
we may not have sufficient cash funds to repurchase the revenue interest upon a repurchase event 
the exact amount of the repurchase price is dependent upon certain factors  including when the repurchase event occurs 
if a repurchase event had been triggered and paul royalty exercised its right to require us to repurchase its revenue interest as of december   we would have owed paul royalty approximately  if we were unable to repurchase the revenue interest upon a repurchase event  paul royalty could foreclose on certain pledged assets  and we could be forced into bankruptcy 
paul royalty could also foreclose on these pledged assets if we became insolvent or involved in a voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy proceeding 
no repurchase events or foreclosures have occurred as of december  or as of the date of this filing 
in the event that we were required to repurchased paul royalty s revenue interest  paul royalty would have no obligation to surrender the shares of our common stock that it had purchased as part of the revenue interest transaction 
in addition beginning in  and during the term of the paul royalty revenue interest agreement  we are required to make advance payments on the revenue interest obligation at the beginning of each year 
in january  we paid to paul royalty the required  advance payment in respect of net sales of our vitoss and cortoss products 
the amount of the advance payment increases to  in  and further increases to  in the years through dividends 
dividends on series a preferred stock accrue and are cumulative from the date of original issuance of the shares of the series a preferred stock  whether or not such dividend is earned or declared by the board of directors  and will be payable at our option either in cash or in kind  subject to certain limitations  on march  june  september and december of each year 
the dividend rate on each share of series a preferred stock will be per year on the  stated value of the series a preferred stock 
commencing after june   for the series a preferred stock still outstanding and not converted to common stock  the dividend rate will increase each quarter by an additional two percentage points  up to a maximum dividend rate of per year 
in addition  in the event that the series a preferred stock becomes subject to mandatory conversion due to our achievement of certain revenue targets prior to july   we will pay an additional dividend equal to the difference between x  per share of series a preferred stock to be converted and y the sum of all dividends that have been paid and all accrued but unpaid dividends with respect to each such share 
certain risks related to our business if cortoss and vitoss are not commercially successful  our operating results will be impaired 
we are highly dependent on successfully selling our products for which we have received regulatory approval 
we expect approvals for our products under development  if obtained at all  to take several years 
to date  we have received regulatory approval to market vitoss  cortoss and aliquot for specified uses in the european union  australia and countries adhering to the regulatory standards of the european union 
we have also received regulatory clearance to market vitoss and imbibe in the us for these reasons  we are dependent upon vitoss and cortoss and their ancillary products  imbibe and aliquot  in their respective approved markets to generate sufficient revenues 
if we are unable to increase sales of our approved products  our operating results will be affected adversely 
because our products have only been recently approved and the markets for our products are evolving  we cannot accurately predict either the future growth rate of product sales  if any  or the ultimate size of these markets 
certain factors which may limit our ability to increase sales include 
our dependence on the efforts of independent agents and distributors to promote the use of our products  over which we have limited control  
the introduction of new products into the market by competing orthopaedic companies based upon other competing technologies  
our dependence on the continued publication of independent pre clinical and clinical data to support the use of our products  
our need to train a sufficient number of surgeons to create demand for our products  and 
the need for payors to authorize insurance reimbursement for procedures using our products 
market acceptance of our products will largely depend on our ability to demonstrate their relative safety  efficacy  cost effectiveness and ease of use 
surgeons will not use our products unless they determine  based on experience  clinical data and recommendations from prominent surgeons and mentors  that our products are safe and effective 
our products are based on new technologies that have not been previously used and must compete with more established treatments currently accepted as the standards of care 
the attributes of some of our products may require some changes in surgical techniques that have become standard within the medical community  and there may be resistance to change 
therefore  for these products  we must be able to convince surgeons who currently favor existing techniques to switch to new procedures that would use our products 
many surgeons will not purchase our products until there is sufficient  long term clinical evidence to convince them to alter their existing treatment methods 
we believe our product sales to date have been made to a group of early adopting surgeons 
in addition  surgeons may be slow to change their medical treatment practices because of perceived liability risks arising from the use of new products and the uncertainty of third party reimbursement for our products 
any failure to gain market acceptance of our products could result in lower sales and the ability to become profitable 
if we are unable to operate an effective sales and distribution network  our ability to generate sales and become profitable will be impaired 
we have assembled a network of commissioned sales agencies in the us in order to market vitoss and imbibe 
outside of the us  we utilize a network of independent stocking distributors to market vitoss  cortoss and aliquot 
if japan medical dynamic marketing  inc is successful in obtaining clearance to market vitoss  it will distribute  sell and market vitoss in japan 
we may seek a similar arrangement for cortoss in japan 
any failure to maintain and manage our distribution network will impair our ability to generate sales and become profitable 
we are dependent upon these distributors and agencies for the sale of our products 
there can be no assurance that the distributors and agencies will perform their obligations in their respective territories as expected or that we will continue to derive any revenue from these arrangements 
we cannot assure our interests will continue to coincide with those of our independent distributors and agencies or that the distributors and agencies will not develop independently  or with alternative companies  other products that could compete with our products 
the independent us agencies selling vitoss generally sell products from other orthopaedic companies 
a single agency may sell vitoss to end user hospitals  as well as hardware manufactured by other orthopaedic companies consisting of metal plates  screws and titanium spinal cages 
should any of these other orthopaedic companies add a bone graft material to their product line  our independent agencies could decide to stop carrying vitoss and terminate their arrangement with us 
our sales could be adversely affected if  for any reason  one or more of our successful agencies lost their hardware product line provided by other orthopaedic companies 
similarly  our independent agencies may be unable or unwilling to carry or effectively sell vitoss should any of these other orthopaedic companies introduce new products into the market based upon other technologies that could compete with vitoss 
additionally  our sales could be adversely affected if one or more of our successful agencies eliminated vitoss from their product line and terminated their agency arrangement with us 
our ability to penetrate the markets we intend to serve is highly dependent upon the quality and breadth of the other product lines carried by our distribution network  the components of which may change from time to time  and over which we have little or no control 
the complete product line represented by the distributors and agencies  including our products  is an important factor in the distributors or agencies ability to penetrate the market 
the off label use of our products may harm the reputation of our products 
the medical devices that we manufacture and market  or intend to market  are subject to extensive regulation by the us fda  the mdd and other worldwide regulatory agencies 
in order to market our products  we must apply for  be granted and maintain all necessary regulatory approvals in each applicable jurisdiction for specified uses of the products 
we market and sell our products only for their approved indication s or use s  however  we cannot control a surgeon s off label use of our product 
we believe there has been an unmet medical need for an injectable material for use in procedures done to repair vertebral compression fractures 
in an attempt to address this need  we pursued clinical studies in europe to demonstrate the safety of using our injectable product cortoss in this type of procedure 
cortoss subsequently received a ce certification in january for use in repairing vertebral compression fractures 
however  surgeons may have attempted to use cortoss off label in procedures to repair vertebral compression fractures performed prior to the european union s approval of cortoss for this type of procedure 
furthermore  all surgeons have not been trained in the proper use of cortoss in vertebral augmentation  since the european union only recently approved the use of cortoss for that type of procedure 
a surgeon who has not been properly trained to use cortoss in a procedure to repair vertebral compression fractures could pose a risk to the reputation of our cortoss product 
the occurrence of an adverse event while using our product off label could adversely affect the reputation of cortoss or any of our other products 
as of the date of this filing  we are not aware that off label uses of our products have had a material adverse effect on the reputation of our products 
if we do not successfully train a sufficient number of surgeons  demand for our products could be adversely affected 
it is critical to the commercial success of our products that our independent distributors and agencies succeed in training a sufficient number of surgeons and in providing them adequate instruction in the use of our products 
this training requires a commitment of time and money by surgeons that they may be unwilling to give 
even if surgeons are willing  if they are not properly trained  they may misuse or ineffectively use our products 
this may result in unsatisfactory patient outcomes  patient injury  negative publicity or lawsuits against us  any of which could damage our business and reduce product sales 
if health care providers cannot obtain third party reimbursement for procedures using our products  or if such reimbursement is inadequate  we may never become profitable 
successful sales of our products in the us and other markets will depend on the availability of adequate reimbursement from third party payors 
healthcare providers  such as hospitals and surgeons that purchase medical devices for treatment of their patients  generally rely on third party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs and fees associated with the procedures performed with these devices 
both public and private insurance reimbursement plans are central to new product acceptance 
healthcare providers may refuse to use our products if reimbursement is inadequate 
we do not yet know how reimbursement will be handled for all of our products because some procedures that use our products are new and reimbursement policies regarding these procedures have not been finalized 
inadequate reimbursement by private insurance companies and government programs could significantly reduce usage of our products 
in addition  an increased emphasis on managed care in the us has placed  and we believe will continue to place  greater pressure on medical device pricing 
such pressures could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell our products 
failure by hospitals and other users of our products to obtain coverage or reimbursement from third party payors or changes in governmental and private third party payors policies toward reimbursement for procedures employing our products would reduce demand for our products 
we may need to raise additional capital in the future or our product development could be limited and our long term viability threatened  however  if we raise additional capital  your percentage ownership as a shareholder of ours will decrease and constraints could be placed on the operation of our business 
we have experienced negative operating cash flows since our inception and have funded our operations primarily from proceeds received from sales of our stock 
in the second half of we raised approximately  in net proceeds from the sale of  shares of our series a preferred stock and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at per share 
we expect to continue to use cash  cash equivalents and short term investments to fund operating and investing activities for at least the next couple years 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of approximately  as of december  will be sufficient to meet our currently estimated operating and investing requirements at least through the first quarter of while we have no immediate plans to do so  we may seek to obtain additional funds in the future through subsequent equity or debt financings  or strategic alliances with third parties  either alone or in combination with equity 
these financings could result in substantial dilution to the holders of our common and preferred stock or require debt service and or revenue sharing arrangements 
any such required financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us 
factors that may cause our future capital requirements to be greater than anticipated include 
unforeseen developments during our pre clinical and clinical trials  
delays in the timing of receipt of required regulatory approvals  
unanticipated expenditures in research and development or manufacturing activities  
delayed market acceptance of our products  
unanticipated expenditures in the acquisition and defense of intellectual property rights  or 
the failure to develop strategic alliances for the marketing of some of our products 
in addition  although we have no present commitments or understandings to do so  we may seek to expand our operations and product line through acquisitions or joint ventures 
any such acquisitions or joint ventures may increase our capital requirements 
if adequate financing is not available  we may be required to delay  scale back or eliminate certain operations 
in the worst case  our long term viability could be threatened 
if we fail to obtain and maintain the regulatory approvals necessary to sell our products  sales could be delayed or never realized 
the jurisdictions in which we will seek to market our products will regulate these products as medical devices 
in most circumstances  we and our distributors and agencies must obtain regulatory approvals and otherwise comply with extensive regulations regarding safety  quality and efficacy standards 
these regulations vary from country to country  and the regulatory review can be lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
we may not obtain or maintain the regulatory approvals necessary to market our products in our targeted markets 
moreover  regulatory approvals that are obtained may involve significant restrictions on the anatomic sites and types of procedures for which our products can be used 
in addition  we may be required to incur significant costs in obtaining or maintaining our regulatory approvals 
if we do not obtain or maintain regulatory approvals to enable us to market our products in the us or elsewhere  or if the approvals are subject to significant restrictions  we may never generate significant revenues 
the regulatory requirements in some of the jurisdictions where we currently market or intend to market our products are outlined below 
united states regulation by fda 
the fda regulates the clinical testing  manufacturing  labeling  distribution and promotion of medical devices 
to date  we have received approval from the fda to market vitoss and imbibe 
during  we received approval from the fda to conduct a pilot clinical study in the us for the use of cortoss in vertebral augmentation using the vertebroplasty surgical technique and have started to enroll patients 
there can be no assurance that the data from this clinical trial will support fda clearance or approval to market this product for this use 
we are currently manufacturing vitoss and cortoss in the us  distributing vitoss and imbibe in the us and distributing vitoss  cortoss and aliquot outside the us we are manufacturing imbibe and aliquot in the us through outside third party contract manufacturers 
vitoss  as well as any other products that we manufacture or distribute following their approval by the fda  will be subject to extensive regulation by the fda 
if safety or efficacy problems occur after the product reaches the market  the fda may impose severe limitations on the use of any approved or cleared product 
moreover  modifications to the approved or cleared product may require the submission of a new approval application or application supplement 
we may not be successful in obtaining approval to market the modified product in a timely manner  if at all 
noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in  among other things  fines  injunctions  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  failure of the government to grant premarket clearance or premarket approval for devices  withdrawal of marketing approvals and criminal prosecution 
european union and other international markets general 
international sales of medical devices are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country in which the products are sold 
accordingly  the introduction of our products in markets outside the us will be subject to regulatory clearances in those jurisdictions 
the regulatory review process varies from country to country 
many countries also impose product standards  packaging and labeling requirements and import restrictions on medical devices 
in addition  each country has its own tariff regulations  duties and tax requirements 
the approval by foreign government authorities is unpredictable  uncertain and can be expensive 
our ability to market our products could be substantially limited due to delays in receipt of  or failure to receive  the necessary approvals or clearances 
requirement of ce certification in the european union 
to market a product in the european union  we must be entitled to affix a ce certification  an international symbol of adherence to quality assurance standards and compliance with applicable european medical device directives 
a ce certification allows us to market a product in all of the countries of the european union  as well as in other countries  such as switzerland and israel  that have adopted the european union s regulatory standards 
to date  we have received a ce certification for the use of vitoss as a bone void filler and for the use of cortoss in screw augmentation and vertebral augmentation procedures 
additionally  we are conducting clinical trials with rhakoss as a spinal implant 
there can be no assurance that we will receive ce certification for rhakoss or any of our other products under development 
requirement of approval in japan 
in order to market our products in japan  we must obtain the approval of the japanese mhw 
we will need to conduct clinical trials for vitoss and cortoss in japan to obtain approval there for those two products 
accordingly  we entered into a third party strategic alliance with japan medical device marketing  inc to conduct clinical trials  obtain the necessary regulatory approvals and market our vitoss product in japan 
there can be no assurance that we will ultimately obtain the approvals necessary to market our products in japan 
while we intend to seek a similar strategic alliance for cortoss in japan  we cannot assure that we will succeed in achieving such an alliance 
if we do not manage commercial scale manufacturing capability and capacity for our products  our product sales may suffer 
our vitoss and cortoss manufacturing facilities produce commercial products and are certified as meeting the requirements of iso and european norm en for the period july  through july  and are subject to inspection by the fda for compliance with fda device manufacture requirements 
we expect to receive iso and en re certification for the period july  through july  in addition to the need for cortoss us regulatory approval  in order to commercialize cortoss in the us  the cortoss manufacturing facility and quality assurance system must pass inspection by the fda 
we are manufacturing imbibe and aliquot through outside third party contract manufacturers 
our third party manufacturers are iso certified or have been audited by us and determined to meet our quality system requirements 
our product sales depend upon  among other things  our ability to manufacture our products in commercial quantities  in compliance with regulatory requirements and in a cost effective manner 
the manufacture of our products is subject to regulation and periodic inspection by various regulatory bodies for compliance with quality standards 
there can be no assurance that the regulatory authorities will not  during the course of an inspection of existing or new facilities  identify what they consider to be deficiencies in meeting the applicable standards and request or seek remedial action 
failure to comply with such regulations or a delay in attaining compliance may result in 
warning letters  
injunctions suspending our manufacture of products  
civil and criminal penalties  
refusal to grant premarket approvals  ce certification or clearances to products that are subject to future or pending submissions  
product recalls or seizures of products  and 
total or partial suspensions of production 
our ability to manufacture vitoss and cortoss is dependent on a limited number of specialty suppliers of certain raw materials 
the failure of a supplier to continue to provide us with these materials at a price or quality acceptable to us  or at all  would have a material adverse effect on our ability to manufacture these products 
moreover  our failure to maintain strategic reserve supplies of each significant single sourced material used to manufacture vitoss  cortoss and certain products that we may develop in the future may result in a breach of our material financing agreements 
although we believe that we maintain good relationships with our suppliers  there can be no guarantee that such supplies and services will continue to be available with respect to our current and future commercialized products 
the difficulties of operating in international markets may harm sales of our products 
the international nature of our business subjects us and our representatives  agents and distributors to the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which they operate  and in which our products are sold 
the types of risks that we face in international operations include 
the imposition of governmental controls  
logistical difficulties in managing international operations  and 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
our international sales and operations may be limited or disrupted if we cannot successfully meet the challenges of operating internationally 
if losses continue in the long term  it could limit our growth in the orthopaedic industry and slow our generation of revenues 
to date  we have not been profitable 
we have incurred substantial operating losses since our inception and  at december   had an accumulated deficit of approximately  these losses have resulted principally from 
the development and patenting of our technologies  
pre clinical and clinical studies  
preparation of submissions to the fda and foreign regulatory bodies  and 
the development of manufacturing  sales and marketing capabilities 
we expect to continue to incur significant operating losses in the future as we continue our product development efforts  expand our marketing and sales activities and further develop our manufacturing capabilities 
we may not ever successfully commercialize our products in development 
we may never be able to achieve or maintain profitability in the future and our products may never be commercially accepted or generate sufficient revenues 
if we fail to meet our obligations under a revenue sharing agreement  we may be required to repurchase from an investor its right to receive revenues on certain of our product sales  and the investor could foreclose on certain assets that are essential to our operations 
during october  we completed a  product development and equity financing with paul royalty 
in this financing  we sold paul royalty a revenue interest and  shares of our common stock 
the revenue interest provides for paul royalty to receive on the first  of annual sales plus of annual sales in excess of  of certain of our products  including vitoss  cortoss and rhakoss  in north america and europe through  subject to certain adjustments 
this revenue interest percentage can increase if we fail to meet contractually specified levels of annual net sales of products for which paul royalty is entitled to receive its revenue interest 
we do not currently expect that changes in the revenue interest percentage resulting from fluctuations in sales of products subject to the revenue interest will have a material effect on operating results for a period when considered relative to sales of the products for that period 
in addition beginning in  and for the term of the revenue interest agreement  we are required to make advance payments on the revenue interest obligation at the beginning of each year 
in january  we paid to paul royalty the required  advance payment in respect of net sales of our vitoss and cortoss products 
the amount of the advance payment increases to  in  and further increases to  in the years through while we believe that we will have sufficient cash at the end of to make the required  advance payment to paul royalty during  we cannot be certain that we will have sufficient cash to meet our advance payment obligations for the years through while the advance payments will impact cash flow within a given year  they will not affect earnings as the advance payments are credited within each year against the revenue interest actually earned by paul royalty during that year  with any excess advance payments refunded to us shortly after the end of each year 
our obligation to pay the revenue interest is secured by our licenses  patents and trademarks relating to certain of our products  including vitoss  cortoss and rhakoss  in north america and europe  and the revenue interest we pay to vita licensing  inc  our wholly owned subsidiary  on the sales of our products collectively  the pledged assets 
we are also required to maintain 
cash and cash equivalent balances equal to or greater than the product of i and ii total operating losses  net of non cash charges  for the preceding fiscal quarter  and 
total shareholders equity of at least  provided  however  that under the provisions of the agreement with paul royalty  when calculating shareholders equity for the purposes of the financial covenants  the revenue interest obligation is included in shareholders equity 
as of december   we were in compliance with all financial covenants 
however  if we fail to maintain such balances and shareholders equity  paul royalty can demand that we repurchase its revenue interest 
in addition to the failure to comply with the financial covenants described above  the occurrence of certain events  including those set forth below  triggers paul royalty s right to require us to repurchase its revenue interest 
a judicial decision that has a material adverse effect on our business  operations  assets or financial condition  
the acceleration of our obligations or the exercise of default remedies by a secured lender under certain debt instruments  
a voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy that involves us or our wholly owned subsidiary  vita special purpose corp  
our insolvency  
a change in control of our company  and 
the breach of a representation  warranty or certification made by us in the agreements with paul royalty that  individually or in the aggregate  would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business  operations  assets or financial condition  and such breach is not cured within days after notice thereof from paul royalty 
we may not have sufficient cash funds to repurchase the revenue interest upon a repurchase event 
the exact amount of the repurchase price is dependent upon certain factors  including when the repurchase event occurs 
if a repurchase event had been triggered and paul royalty exercised its right to require us to repurchase its revenue interest as of december   we would have owed paul royalty approximately  the repurchase price for paul royalty s revenue interest as of a given date is calculated in three steps 
first  a specified annual rate of return not to exceed is applied to paul royalty s  original purchase price from october  to the date of determination of the repurchase price 
second  the result obtained from the first step of the calculation is added to the original  purchase price 
third  the sum obtained from the second step of the calculation is reduced by both  and the actual revenue interest paid during the specified period 
if we were unable to repurchase the revenue interest upon a repurchase event  paul royalty could foreclose on the pledged assets  and we could be forced into bankruptcy 
paul royalty could also foreclose on the pledged assets if we became insolvent or involved in a voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy proceeding 
no repurchase events or foreclosures have occurred as of december  or as of the date of this filing 
in the event that we repurchased paul royalty s revenue interest  paul royalty would have no obligation to surrender the shares of our common stock that it had purchased as part of the revenue interest transaction 
our results of operations may fluctuate due to factors out of our control  which could cause volatility in our stock price 
vitoss  imbibe  cortoss and aliquot are currently our only products for which we have received regulatory approvals for sale 
vitoss is cleared for sale in the us and the european union 
imbibe is cleared for sale in the us cortoss and aliquot are cleared for sale in the european union 
we began selling vitoss in europe in the fourth quarter of and began selling vitoss in the us late in the first quarter of we began sales of cortoss in europe and imbibe in the us at the end of  we began sales of aliquot in europe in the second quarter of future levels of vitoss  cortoss  aliquot and imbibe product sales are difficult to predict 
vitoss product sales are difficult to predict  and vitoss sales to date may not be indicative of future sales levels 
vitoss  cortoss and aliquot sales levels in europe may fluctuate due to the timing of any distributor stocking orders and vitoss and imbibe sales levels may fluctuate in the us due to the timing of orders from hospitals 
our results of operations may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a number of factors  many of which are outside of our control 
these factors include  but are not limited to 
the timing of governmental approvals for our products and our competitors products  
unanticipated events associated with clinical and pre clinical trials of our products  
the medical community s acceptance of our products  
the timing in obtaining adequate third party reimbursement of our products  
the success of products competitive with ours  
our ability to enter into strategic alliances with other companies  
expenses associated with development and protection of intellectual property matters  
establishment of commercial scale manufacturing capabilities  
world events affecting logistics and elective surgery trends  
the timing of expenses related to commercialization of new products  
competitive disruptions to our distribution channels from business development arrangements  and 
the adequate training of a sufficient number of surgeons 
the results of our operations may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and may not meet expectations of securities analysts and investors 
this may cause our stock price to be volatile 
our business will be damaged if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights to vitoss  cortoss or our other products  and we may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims by others 
we rely on patent protection  as well as a combination of copyright  trade secret and trademark laws  nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements and other contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary technology 
however  these measures afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights 
for example  our patents may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented by third parties 
as of the date of this filing  we own eight issued us patents  eleven pending us patent applications and numerous counterparts of certain of these patents and pending patent applications worldwide  including canada  europe  mexico and japan 
there can be no assurance that patents will issue from any of the pending patent applications 
moreover  we cannot be certain that we were the first creator of inventions covered by pending patent applications or we were the first to file patent applications for the relevant inventions for the following reasons 
patent applications filed prior to december in the us are maintained in secrecy until issued  
patent applications filed after november in the us are maintained in secrecy until eighteen months from the date of filing  
publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature tends to lag behind actual discoveries 
if we do receive a patent  it may not be broad enough to protect our proprietary position in the technology or to be commercially useful to us 
in addition  if we lose any key personnel  we may not be able to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our technical knowledge or other trade secrets by those former employees 
furthermore  the laws of foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us finally  even if our intellectual property rights are adequately protected  litigation or other proceedings may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights  which could result in substantial costs to us and result in a diversion of management attention 
if our intellectual property is not adequately protected  our competitors could use the intellectual property that we have developed to enhance their products and compete more directly with us  which could damage our business 
in addition to the risk of failing to adequately protect our proprietary rights  there is a risk that we may become subject to a claim that we infringe upon the proprietary rights of others 
although we do not believe that we are infringing the rights of others  third parties may claim that we are doing so 
there is a substantial amount of litigation over patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry generally  and in the spinal market segments particularly 
if the holder of patents brought an infringement action against us  the cost of litigating the claim could be substantial and divert management attention 
in addition  if a court determined that one of our products infringed a patent  we could be prevented from selling that product unless we could obtain a license from the owner of the patent 
a license may not be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
modification of our products or development of new products to avoid infringement may require us to conduct additional clinical trials for these new or modified products and to revise our filings with the fda  which is time consuming and expensive 
if we were not successful in obtaining a license or redesigning our product  our business could suffer 
if we cannot keep up with technological changes and marketing initiatives of competitors  sales of our products may be harmed 
extensive research efforts and rapid technological change characterize the market for products in the orthopaedic market 
we anticipate that we will face intense competition from medical device  medical products and pharmaceutical companies 
our products could be rendered noncompetitive or obsolete by competitors technological advances 
we may be unable to respond to technological advances through the development and introduction of new products 
moreover  many of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing  sales  distribution  manufacturing and technological resources than us 
these competitors may be in the process of seeking fda or other regulatory approvals  or patent protection  for their respective products 
our competitors could  therefore  commercialize competing products in advance of our products 
they may also enjoy substantial advantages over us in terms of 
research and development expertise  
experience in conducting clinical trials  
experience in regulatory matters  
manufacturing efficiency  
name recognition  
sales and marketing expertise  
established distribution channels  and 
established relationships with health care providers and payors 
as a result of the above  our plans for market acceptance of our products may be adversely impacted 
we may acquire technologies or companies in the future  and these acquisitions could result in dilution to our shareholders and disruption of our business 
entering into an acquisition could divert management attention 
we also could fail to assimilate the acquired company  which could lead to higher operating expenses 
finally  our shareholders could be diluted if we issue shares of our stock to acquire another company or technology 
by increasing the number of shares of our common stock that may be sold into the market  we could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly  even if our business is doing well 
during july and october   we completed a private placement transaction in which we sold  shares of our series a preferred stock and warrants to purchase an aggregate  shares of our common stock 
as part of this transaction  we issued warrants to purchase an aggregate  shares of our common stock to the persons designated by our placement agent for the private placement 
in february  we registered for resale the shares issuable under the series a preferred stock and the warrants that were issued in the private placement transaction 
the  shares of our common stock covered by our february registration are freely saleable in the public market beginning on the effective date of that registration 
the shares consist of i  shares that may be issued upon the conversion of outstanding shares of our series a preferred stock  ii  shares that may be issued upon the exercise of outstanding warrants that were sold to investors  iii  shares that may be issued upon the exercise of outstanding warrants issued by us to the persons designated by our placement agent  and iv an additional  shares that have or may be issued x as a payment of dividends on our series a preferred stock  or y upon the conversion of series a preferred stock or exercise of warrants if adjustments are made to the conversion price of the series a preferred stock or to the number of shares issuable upon the exercise of the warrants  as the case may be 
the number of shares covered by our february registration represents approximately of the total number of our shares of common stock issued and outstanding 
the number of shares covered by our registration includes substantially more than the sum of i the shares received as payment of dividends on the series a preferred stock and ii the number of shares to which are currently eligible to be receive upon the conversion of the series a preferred stock and the exercise of the warrants 
we registered for resale more shares than have been issued or are currently issuable under the series a preferred stock and warrants pursuant to contractual obligations with the selling security holders and to ensure that a sufficient number of shares is registered in the event that i we pay dividends on the series a preferred stock by issuing shares of common stock in lieu of paying such dividends in cash  or ii adjustments  if any  are made to the conversion price of the series a preferred stock or to the number of shares issuable upon the exercise of the warrants 
sales of these shares in the public market  or the perception that future sales of these shares could occur  could have the effect of lowering the market price of our common stock below current levels and make it more difficult for us and our shareholders to sell our equity securities in the future 
our prior use of arthur andersen llp as our independent public accountants could impact our ability to access the capital markets 
our consolidated financial statements as of and for each of the two years in the period ended december  were audited by arthur andersen llp andersen 
on march   andersen was indicted on federal obstruction of justice charges arising from the government s investigation of enron corporation 
following this event  our audit committee directed management to consider the need to appoint new independent public accountants 
on june   a jury found andersen guilty on the government s charges 
on july   at the direction of the board of directors  acting upon the recommendation of the audit committee  we dismissed andersen and appointed kpmg llp as our new independent public accountants for fiscal year sec rules require us to present our audited financial statements in various sec filings  along with andersen s consent to our inclusion of its audit report in those filings 
however  andersen is unable to provide a consent to us for inclusion in our future sec filings relating to its report on our consolidated financial statements as of and for each of the two years in the period ended december  additionally  andersen is unable to provide us with assurance services  such as advice customarily given to underwriters of our securities offerings and other similar market participants 
the sec has provided regulatory relief designed to allow companies that file reports with the sec to dispense with the requirement to file a consent of andersen in certain circumstances 
notwithstanding this relief  the inability of andersen to provide its consent or to provide assurance services to us in the future could negatively affect our ability to  among other things  access the public capital markets 
any delay or inability to access the public markets as a result of this situation could have a material adverse impact on our business 
also  an investor s ability to seek potential recoveries from andersen related to any claims that an investor may assert as a result of the audit performed by andersen may be limited significantly both as a result of an absence of a consent and the diminished amount of assets of andersen that are or may in the future be available to satisfy claims 
provisions of pennsylvania law or our articles of incorporation may deter a third party from seeking to obtain control of us or may affect your rights as a shareholder 
certain provisions of pennsylvania law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  or could discourage a third party from attempting to acquire us 
these provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
in addition  our articles of incorporation enable our board of directors to issue up to  shares of preferred stock having rights  privileges and preferences as are determined by the board of directors 
accordingly  our board of directors is empowered  without shareholder approval  to issue preferred stock with dividend  liquidation  conversion  voting or other rights superior to those of our common shareholders 
for example  an issuance of preferred stock could 
adversely affect the voting power of the common shareholders  
make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of us  
discourage bids for our common stock at a premium  or 
otherwise adversely affect the market price of the common stock 
as of the date of this filing  our board of directors has designated and issued  shares of series a preferred stock 
we may issue additional shares of our authorized preferred stock at any time 
we are required to pay quarterly dividends to our preferred stock shareholders 
dividends on series a preferred stock accrue and are cumulative from the date of original issuance of the shares of the series a preferred stock  whether or not such dividend is earned or declared by the board of directors  and will be payable at our option either in cash or in kind  subject to certain limitations  on march  june  september and december of each year 
the dividend rate on each share of series a preferred stock will be per year on the  stated value of the series a preferred stock 
commencing after june   for the series a preferred stock still outstanding and not converted to common stock  the dividend rate will increase each quarter by an additional two percentage points  up to a maximum dividend rate of per year 
in addition  in the event that the series a preferred stock becomes subject to mandatory conversion due to our achievement of certain revenue targets prior to july   we will pay an additional dividend equal to the difference between x  per share of series a preferred stock to be converted and y the sum of all dividends that have been paid and all accrued but unpaid dividends with respect to each such share 
we do not intend to pay any dividends to our common shareholders 
we have never declared nor paid dividends on our common stock 
we currently intend to retain any future earnings for funding growth and  therefore  do not intend to pay any cash dividends to our common stock shareholders in the foreseeable future 
our executive officers and directors own a large percentage of our voting stock and could exert significant influence over matters requiring shareholder approval  including takeover attempts 
our executive officers and directors  and their respective affiliates  beneficially own as of the date of this filing approximately of our outstanding common stock 
one of our directors  jonathan silverstein  is employed by an affiliate of orbimed associates llc  pw juniper crossover fund  llc and caduceus private investments  lp collectively  orbimed  which beneficially own approximately of our outstanding common stock as of the date of this filing 
accordingly  these shareholders may  as a practical matter  be able to exert significant influence over matters requiring approval by our shareholders  including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combinations 
this concentration could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control 
our stock price may be volatile 
our stock price  like that of many medical technology companies  may be volatile 
in general  equity markets  including nasdaq  have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies or existing economic conditions 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
the following factors could also cause our stock price to be volatile or decrease 
fluctuations in our results of operations  
under performance in relation to analysts estimates or financial guidance provided by us  
changes in the financial guidance we provide to the investment community  
changes in stock market analyst recommendations regarding our stock  
announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors  
issues in establishing commercial scale manufacturing capabilities  
unanticipated events associated with clinical and pre clinical trials  
fda and international regulatory actions regarding us or our competitors  
determinations by governments and insurance companies regarding reimbursement for medical procedures using our or our competitors products

from june until august   our common stock traded exclusively on the nasdaq europe exchange formerly known as easdaq 
since august   our common stock has traded on both the nasdaq europe exchange and the nasdaq national market 
the trading volume of our common stock is  and may continue to be  limited 
to continue to be listed on the nasdaq national market  we must continue to meet  with certain exceptions  one of two separate continued listing standards with specified maintenance criteria  including 
specified levels for total shareholders equity  
the number of shares and the market value of the public float  
a minimum bid price per share  and 
total market capitalization or total assets and total revenue 
in addition  if the per share bid price of our common stock is below  we may be required to raise more capital than what is necessary to fund our operations by the fourth quarter of in order to satisfy nasdaq national market shareholders equity threshold 
the additional capital may not be available on satisfactory terms  if at all 
any additional equity capital raised could result in substantial dilution to our shareholders 
in addition  even if we satisfy the nasdaq national market shareholders equity threshold  if the minimum bid price of our common stock fell below we could still face delisting from the nasdaq national market 
we believe that we currently satisfy the requisite nasdaq national market listing requirements  however  should we fail to meet the nasdaq national market listing requirements in the future  our stock could then list on the nasdaq smallcap market or the over the counter exchange  which would further limit the trading volume and liquidity of our stock and adversely impact the stock price

any product liability claim brought against us  with or without merit  could result in the increase of our product liability insurance rates or the inability to secure coverage in the future 
in addition  we would have to pay any amount awarded by a court in excess of policy limits 
we maintain product liability insurance in the annual aggregate amount of up to  although our insurance policies have various exclusions 
thus  we may be subject to a product liability claim for which we have no insurance coverage  in which case we may have to pay the entire amount of any award 
even in the absence of a claim  our insurance rates may rise in the future to a point where we may decide not to carry this insurance 
a merit less or unsuccessful product liability claim would be time consuming and expensive to defend and could result in the diversion of management s attention from our core business 
a successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us in excess of our coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our business could suffer if we cannot attract and retain the services of key employees 
we depend substantially upon the continued service and performance of our existing executive officers 
we rely on key personnel in formulating and implementing our product research  development and commercialization strategies 
our success will depend in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees 
we compete for such personnel with other companies  academic institutions  government entities and other organizations 
we may not be successful in hiring or retaining qualified personnel 
if one or more of our key employees resigns  the loss of that employee could harm our business 
if we lose any key personnel  we may not be able to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our technical knowledge or other trade secrets by those former employees
