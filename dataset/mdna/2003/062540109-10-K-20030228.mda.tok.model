critical accounting estimates the company s consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and follow general practices within the industries it operates 
the most significant accounting polices followed by the company are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements which is incorporated by reference in this item 
application of these principles requires management to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements 
critical accounting estimates are defined as those that require assumptions to be made that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made and where the impact of the selection of the estimate or a change in the estimate from period to period would have a material impact on the financial statements 
based on the potential impact to the financial statements of the valuation methods  estimates  assumptions and judgments used  management identified the determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses the allowance  the valuation of mortgage servicing rights and the valuation of leased asset residuals to be the accounting estimates that are the most subjective and or judgmental 
allowance for loan and lease losses the company maintains an allowance in an amount adequate to cover management s estimate of probable credit losses based on analyses of historical loss experience supplemented by judgmental expectations of the impact of economic conditions as of a given balance sheet date 
the determination of the amount of the allowance is a critical accounting estimate as it requires the use of estimates and significant judgment related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated loss rates on homogenous portfolios and deliberation on economic factors and trends 
it is possible that the allowance could have been reduced or increased if the company had judged economic conditions and risk to be more or less favorable 
see further information on the accounting for the allowance in corporate risk profile allowance for loan and lease losses 

table of contents mortgage servicing rights valuation when mortgage loans are sold with servicing retained  a servicing asset is established and accounted for based on estimated fair values that are based upon discounted cash flow modeling techniques  which require management to make estimates regarding the amount and timing of expected future cash flows  including assumptions about loan repayment rates  costs to service  as well as interest rate assumptions that contemplate the risk involved 
because the value of these assets is sensitive to changes in the estimates and assumptions made  the valuation of mortgage servicing rights is considered a critical accounting estimate 
had the company assumed that interest rates would decrease and prepayment rates remain at record speeds  then the value of the mortgage servicing rights could have been lower 
note to the consolidated financial statements includes further discussion on the accounting for these assets and a sensitivity analysis  and is incorporated by reference in this item 
residual valuation of leased assets lease financing receivables include a residual value component  which represents the estimated value of the leased asset upon lease expiration 
the valuation of leased assets is considered a critical accounting estimate due to the subjectivity surrounding the future valuation 
the determination of expected value at lease termination is derived from a variety of sources  including equipment valuation services  appraisals and publicly available market data on recent sales transactions on similar equipment 
the length of time until termination and the cyclical nature of equipment values are important variables considered in making this determination 
residual values could have been lower if the company had assumed that current uncertainties in the airline industry would continue indefinitely or there is a greater incidence of airlines using the bankruptcy process to lower aircraft lease rates or eliminate unused aircraft 
these values could also affect the level of the allowance

a range of estimated losses is calculated based on historical loss rates and average delinquency flows to loss 
for those commercial borrowers that are on non accrual status and borrowers identified by management as exhibiting above average levels of risk  impairment is measured on an individual basis in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for creditors for impairment of a loan as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures sfas no 

commercial borrowers not individually impaired are collectively evaluated for impairment based on line of business and internal risk rating segmentation 
loss estimates are calculated based on analysis of historical risk rating migrating to loss 
retail and small business portfolios are evaluated for impairment collectively  based on product and geography 
both retail and commercial loss models are updated quarterly 
management adjustments are applied to the baseline component based on assessments and expectations of portfolio performance not captured in the historical loss rates 
relevant factors considered in the assessment based on observable data include  but are not limited to a formal company wide rolling quarterly forecast of asset quality metrics  including net charge offs  growth rates  extent of portfolio seasoning  specific historical events  downside scenarios for specific borrowers  existing and emerging trends in delinquency and impairment  expectations of portfolio performance in terms of directionality  volatility  and stress testing  borrower  industry  and geographical concentrations  credit management changes  changes in underwriting  charge off or collection policies and procedures  coverage tests of classified and criticized exposure  and pending accounting or regulatory changes 

table of contents the allowance was million at december   a decrease of million from december  the ratio of the allowance to total loans was at december  compared with at year end allowance coverage of non accrual loans of at december  increased from in the prior year 
current year allowance coverage of net charge offs of times improved from times in see note to the consolidated financial statements for changes in the allowance during the last five years 
net charge offs for of million or of total average loans decreased significantly from million or of total average loans in this improvement in net charge offs reflects management s execution of portfolio strategies in an effort to shift to lower risk industries  reduce large borrower concentrations and syndicated national credits  as well as enhanced credit management and collections in the retail businesses 
the fourth quarter of included an million charge off of a united states air carrier that declared bankruptcy 
net charge offs and use of provisions in largely reflected credit losses realized upon the exit of certain higher risk relationships by selling those loans at a loss 
the allocated component of the allowance  million at december  decreased million from the prior year  commensurate with the overall improvement in asset quality 
the general component of the allowance  million of the total at december   increased by million from million in of the total 
although asset quality has improved  prompting a release in the allocated component  the general component was held essentially flat to the prior year  to address uncertainty from the geo political situation  and risk in the air transportation industry 
while management has allocated a portion of the allowance to specific loan categories  the adequacy of the allowance must be considered in its entirety 
allowance allocations by loan category are presented in table allocation of allowance for loan and lease losses table december  allowance percent of out standing loans allowance percent of out standing loans allowance percent of out standing loans allowance percent of out standing loans allowance percent of out standing loans dollars in millions domestic loans commercial commercial and industrial commercial mortgage construction lease financing total commercial consumer residential mortgage home equity other consumer lease financing total consumer total domestic foreign loans not allocated total includes both foreign and domestic general reserves 

table of contents the allowance is considered adequate by management at december   given its analysis of estimated probable credit losses  credit risk profile  economic conditions  and coverage ratios 
market risk market risk is the potential of loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and prices 
the company is exposed to market risk as a consequence of the normal course of conducting its business activities 
financial products that expose the company to market risk include investment securities  loans  deposits  debt and derivative financial instruments 
the company s market risk management process involves measuring  monitoring  controlling and managing risks that can significantly impact the company s financial position and operating results 
in this management process  market risks are balanced with expected returns in an effort to enhance earnings performance and shareholder value  while limiting the volatility of each 
the activities associated with these market risks are categorized into trading and other than trading 
the company s trading activities include foreign currency and foreign exchange contracts that expose the company to a minor degree of foreign currency risk 
these transactions are executed on behalf of customers and for the company s own account 
the company manages its trading account such that it maintains only insignificant foreign currency open positions 
the company continues to use a value at risk var calculation based on an estimated variance co variance matrix 
the var calculation determines the potential loss within a confidence interval 
in other words  a loss greater than var has generally not more than a probability of occurring 
the exposure from foreign currency trading positions measured by the var methodology as of year end continued to be immaterial 
during  the company s foreign operations in japan and korea repatriated all their capital 
approximately  of capital remains in taiwan due to local regulations 
the repatriation of the remaining taiwan capital is expected in the company s other than trading activities include normal business transactions that expose the company s balance sheet profile to varying degrees of market risk 
the company s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
a key element in the process of managing market risk involves oversight by senior management and the board of directors as to the level of such risk assumed by the company in its balance sheet 
the board of directors reviews and approves risk management policies  including risk limits and guidelines and delegates to the asset liability management committee the alco oversight functions 
the alco  consisting of senior business and finance officers  monitors the company s market risk exposure and as market conditions dictate  modifies balance sheet positions 
the alco may also direct the use of derivative instruments 
interest rate risk the company s balance sheet is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates 
this interest rate risk arises primarily from the company s normal business activities of making loans and taking deposits 
many other factors also affect the company s exposure to changes in interest rates  such as general economic and financial conditions  customer preferences  and historical pricing relationships 
the earnings of the company and its principal subsidiary are affected not only by general economic conditions  but also by the monetary and fiscal policies of the united states and its agencies  particularly the federal reserve system 
the monetary policies of the federal reserve system influence to a significant extent the overall growth of loans  investments  and deposits  the level of interest rates earned on assets and paid for liabilities  and interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits 
the nature and impact of future changes in monetary policies are often not predictable 
a key element in the company s ongoing process to measure and monitor interest rate risk is the utilization of a net interest income nii monte carlo simulation model 
this model is used to estimate the amount that nii will change over a one year time horizon under various interest rate scenarios 
these estimates are based on assumptions on the behavior of loan and deposit volumes as a function of pricing  prepayment speeds on mortgage related assets  and principal amortization and maturities on other financial instruments 
the model 
table of contents specification includes embedded optionality 
while such assumptions are inherently uncertain  management believes that these assumptions are reasonable 
as a result  the nii simulation model captures the dynamic nature of the balance sheet and provides a sophisticated estimate rather than a precise prediction of nii s exposure to higher or lower interest rates 
table presents  as of december   and  the estimate of the change in nii from a gradual basis point increase or decrease in interest rates  moving in parallel fashion for the entire yield curve  over the next month period relative to the measured base case scenario for nii 
the resulting estimate in nii exposure was within the approved alco guidelines 
market risk exposure to interest rate changes table december  interest rate change in basis points interest rate change in basis points interest rate change in basis points estimated exposure as a percent of net interest income to enhance and complement the results from the nii simulation model  the company also reviews other measures of interest rate risk 
these measures include the sensitivity of market value of equity and the exposure to basis risk and non parallel yield curve shifts 
there are inherent limitations to these measures but used along with the nii simulation model  the company obtains a better overall insight for managing its exposure to changes in interest rates 
in managing interest rate risks  the company uses several approaches to modify its risk position 
approaches that are used to shift balance sheet mix or alter the interest rate characteristics of assets and liabilities include changing product pricing strategies  modifying investment portfolio characteristics  or using financial derivative instruments 
the use of financial derivatives  as detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements  has been limited over the past several years 
liquidity management liquidity is managed in an effort to ensure that the company has continuous access to sufficient  reasonably priced funding 
funding requirements are impacted by loan refinancings and originations  liability settlements and issuances  and off balance sheet funding commitments 
the company considers and complies with various regulatory guidelines regarding required liquidity levels and periodically monitors its liquidity position in light of the changing economic environment and customer activity 
based on periodic liquidity assessments  the company may alter its assets  liabilities and off balance sheet positions 
the company s alco monitors sources and uses of funds and modifies asset and liability positions as liquidity requirements change 
this process  combined with the company s ability to raise funds in money and capital markets and through private placements  provides flexibility in managing the exposure to liquidity risk 
in an effort to ensure that its liquidity needs are met  the company actively manages both the asset and liability sides of the statement of condition 
the primary sources of liquidity are available for sale investment securities  interest bearing deposits  and cash flows from loans and investments  as well as the ability to sell or securitize certain assets 
with respect to liabilities  liquidity is generated through growth in deposits and other funding 
during  the company continued to use funds generated from the divestiture program to repurchase stock see capital management and reduce debt where possible 
the company has not utilized off balance sheet financing arrangements as a significant source of liquidity 
it is not expected that such arrangements will be used significantly in the future

table of contents capital management the company and the bank are subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can cause certain mandatory and discretionary actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a material effect on the company s financial statements 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  the company and the bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative and qualitative measures 
these measures were established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy 
at december  and  the company and the bank were well capitalized under this regulatory framework

fourth quarter results and other matters net income in the fourth quarter of was million  an increase of from net income of million in the fourth quarter of last year 
diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of were  an increase of or from per diluted share for the same period last year 
the presence of non core items and the effect of business divestitures in continue to have a significant impact on the comparability with prior year results

earnings for the fourth quarter of included gains on divestitures and restructuring items that increased net income by million  or per diluted share 

table of contents net interest income for the fourth quarter of on a fully taxable equivalent basis was million  down million from the third quarter of  primarily due to decreased interest rates 
net interest income was down million from the fourth quarter of  primarily due to lower average earning assets related to the divestitures and the managed reduction of loans in an effort to reduce credit risk 
the net interest margin was for the fourth quarter of  a basis point increase from in the previous quarter and a basis point increase from in the same quarter last year 
the net interest margin improvement was largely due to lengthening the maturities of some short term investments  reductions in short term borrowings and time deposits  as well as debt repurchases  which lowered the company s cost of funds 
given continued improvements in the company s credit quality and economic conditions  the company did not recognize a provision during the fourth quarter of this resulted in an million reduction in the allowance  which equaled the amount of net charge offs for the quarter 
the provision was million in the fourth quarter of non interest income was million for the quarter 
non interest income of million for the fourth quarter of included million in net gains on sales of the company s south pacific operations which were partially offset by write downs on venture investments
