we do not intend for the information contained on our website to be a part of this annual report 
we are a specialty pharmaceutical company that markets and sells brand name prescription drugs and ethically promoted healthcare products 
we focus on products for the treatment of acute and critical care conditions  including central nervous system diseases and gastroenterological disorders 
our strategy is to acquire pharmaceutical products from companies who do not actively market such products that we believe have sales growth potential  are promotion sensitive and complement our existing products 
in addition  through corporate collaborations we intend to develop new patented intranasal formulations of previously fda approved drugs 
we may also acquire companies with complementary products 
for the year ended december   our total net revenues were million 
large multinational companies dominate the us prescription pharmaceutical market 
these companies often divest products which  as a result of consolidation or lack of strategic fit  do not meet the threshold level of sales required for continued marketing and promotion  as these companies tend to focus on drugs with annual sales in excess of billion 
since inception  we have acquired and licensed products from aventis pharmaceuticals  inc aventis  schwartz pharma ag and other pharmaceutical companies 
smaller drug development or biotech companies that do not have the capabilities to effectively market and sell approved products will also be sources of products 
since  we have introduced products 
we promote our products through our nationwide sales and marketing force of approximately professionals  targeting high prescribing acute care and specialty physicians such as pediatric neurologists and gastroenterologists 
third parties manufacture all of our products 
our key products include hp acthar gel acthar  an injectable drug that helps patients with infantile spasm  or west syndrome  and the periodic flares that are experienced by patients with multiple sclerosis  ethamolin  an injectable drug used to treat esophageal varices that have recently bled  and glofil and inulin in sodium chloride  which are both injectable agents that assess kidney function by measuring glomerular filtration rate 
in an agreement effective january  we acquired the us promotion rights to vsl tm  a patented probiotic marketed as a dietary supplement to promote normal gastrointestinal function 
in july  we signed a license agreement with fabre kramer pharmaceuticals  inc fabre kramer  whereby fabre kramer will manage and provide funding for the clinical development programs for hypnostat tm intranasal triazolam for insomnia and panistat tm intranasal alprazolam for panic disorders 
we have rights to the following registered trademarks hp acthar gel  ethamolin and glofil we also have the following unregistered trademarks  migrastat tm  emitasol tm  hypnostat tm  and panistat tm 

table of contents vsl tm is owned by vsl pharmaceuticals  inc pramidin is owned by sirton pharmaceuticals spa each other trademark  trade name or service mark appearing in this document belongs to its respective holder 
strategy we believe that our ability to market and acquire brand name products and our ability to increase our sales and improve our marketing infrastructure uniquely positions us to continue to grow 
the key elements of our strategy include increase sales of products through targeted promotion 
we seek to increase sales by promoting our products to high prescribing acute care and specialty physicians through our nationwide sales and marketing force that includes approximately professionals 
for example  according to ndchealth s pharmaceutical audit suite service  prescriptions for acthar during the fourth quarter of was higher than prescriptions during the same period in we also use continuing education programs to promote our products 
identify and license or acquire brand name prescription products 
we seek to acquire the rights to brand name pharmaceutical products that we believe will i benefit from increased marketing efforts directed at high prescribing acute care and specialty physicians  ii leverage our existing sales infrastructure  and iii complement our existing products 
since inception  we have acquired or licensed five products 
products to be considered for acquisition would have to be complementary to our existing products  synergistic with promotional efforts currently being undertaken by our sales force  and contribute to our gross margin 
there is no assurance we will be able to acquire such products or  if acquired  that they will be profitable 
acquire companies that sell products that complement our current products and sales strategy 
we regularly review opportunities to acquire companies that sell products that complement the current products that we sell and target the physicians to whom we promote our products 
marketed pharmaceutical and related healthcare products our marketed products as of december  include acthar  which was acquired in july  ethamolin  which was acquired in november  glofil and inulin  which were acquired in august  and vsl  which we acquired the rights to market and sell pursuant to a promotion agreement effective in january acthar 
h 
p acthar gel acthar is a nonsynthetic  highly purified preparation of the adrenal corticotropin hormone acth 
acthar is specially formulated to provide prolonged release after intramuscular or subcutaneous injection 
it works by stimulating the adrenal cortex to secrete the natural endogenous corticosteroids  including cortisol  corticosterone  aldosterone  and a number of weakly androgenic substances 
in july  we signed an agreement with aventis to acquire the worldwide rights to acthar 
due to limited distribution of acthar prior to our acquisition of the product from aventis  the drug wholesalers did not have access to acthar 
following the acquisition of acthar in july  we began shipping the product to drug wholesalers at the end of the third quarter of as part of our agreement with aventis  aventis agreed to manufacture and supply acthar through july at a fixed price per vial 
aventis produced their final batch of acthar for us in july that batch has a january expiration date 
we have made plans to produce our first batch of finished acthar vials at our new contract manufacturer during and we expect to be able to place that new batch into commercial supply in although the fda has reviewed our site transfer plans  this new final fill manufacturer will be subject to approval under the appropriate fda guidelines 
while we believe that the transfer will be approved in time to ensure an adequate supply of acthar  there can be no assurance that the transfer to the final fill manufacturer will be approved and if approved  that it will be approved on a timely basis 
we are also in the process of securing a new manufacturer for the production of the active pharmaceutical ingredient the api in acthar 
we have formal proposals from several potential third party contract manufacturers for the api and we expect to select our new contract manufacturer for the api during the first half of under the agreement with aventis  we are committed 
table of contents to purchase the api and other inventory residing at aventis 
we believe that the existing inventory of the api  previously manufactured by aventis  should be adequate to supply the annual acthar demand through  based on our internal sales forecasts 
however  there can be no assurance that the existing inventory of the api will be sufficient to meet our demand through or beyond  or that we will be able to enter into agreements with third party manufacturers to supply acthar  or if these agreements are entered into that the third party manufacturers will be able to supply acthar 
additionally  under our prior arrangement  aventis supplied acthar at a fixed price per vial through july there can be no assurance  even if we are able to secure an adequate supply of the new api and enter into an agreement for the production of the finished product  that the cost of the api and the finished product will not increase 
acthar gross margins were for the year ended december  acthar is useful in a wide variety of conditions 
most frequently it is used to treat infantile spasms is  periodic flare associated with multiple sclerosis ms  and various forms of arthritis  collectively called joint pain jp 
however  the disease with the most compelling need for acthar treatment is is  an epileptic syndrome characterized by the triad of infantile spasm generalized seizures  hypsarrhythmia and arrest of psychomotor development at seizure onset 
we estimate that as many as  children annually experience bouts of this devastating syndrome in the us in percent of children with is  the spasms occur during the first year of life  typically between months of age 
the age of first onset rarely occurs after the age of two 
patients left untreated or treated inadequately have a poor prognosis for intellectual and functional development 
about two thirds of patients are neurologically impaired prior to the onset of is  while one third are otherwise normal 
rapid and aggressive therapy to control the abnormal seizure activity appears to improve the chances that these children will develop to their fullest potential 
the market for is therapies has not changed much over the last several years 
since acthar s availability in the several years before our acquisition from aventis was very restricted  many physicians had begun to use other synthetic steroids and had even sought to obtain vigabatrin sabril  aventis from canada  an unapproved product in the us 
a recent symposium on is  sponsored by the child neurology society  discussed the fact that there has been no clinical evidence to show that any therapy is better than acthar for the treatment of infantile spasms 
the proceedings of that symposium are now available to all pediatric neurologists as a continuing medical education monograph 
acthar is also indicated for use in acute exacerbations of ms and is prescribed currently for patients that have ms and experience painful  episodic flares 
we expect to begin to more fully develop the market for acthar use in treating ms during sales promotion of acthar for jp is not anticipated at this point 
ethamolin 
end stage liver disease  also known as hepatic cirrhosis  results in approximately  deaths annually 
hepatic cirrhosis promotes the formation of esophageal varices through development of portal hypertension 
when portal venous blood pressure rises  the varicosities that develop may cause life threatening upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage and are associated with a high mortality rate 
at least  patients in the us have either actively bleeding esophageal varices or esophageal varices that are at imminent risk of bleeding 
early and effective treatment of esophageal varices to achieve hemostasis is essential to a favorable outcome in a bleeding patient 
the most common pharmaceutical treatment protocol involves the injection of a sclerosing agent into the varix  achieving clot formation and obliteration of the varix 
this form of hemostasis is called sclerotherapy and usually requires multiple treatment sessions 
ethamolin is the only sclerotherapy agent approved by the food and drug administration fda for the treatment of esophageal varices that have recently bled 
there is strong competition from band ligation  a form of surgery  but we believe that ethamolin is the only sclerosant that is actively promoted for this indication  at this time 
we estimate ethamolin to have approximately one fifth on a volume basis  of the total sclerosant market share for all indications  at this time 
glofil and inulin 
kidney disease afflicts more than million persons in the us and is increasing primarily due to an increase in diabetes mellitus  hypertension and glomerulonephritis cases 
kidney disease results in over billion annually in healthcare costs in the us the market includes an estimated  persons with severe kidney diseases   persons receiving kidney transplants annually  and an additional 
table of contents  persons awaiting kidney transplants 
the measurement of kidney function  glomerular filtration rate gfr is critical to the understanding of the disease state and its appropriate therapeutic intervention 
gfr has historically been estimated by the measurement of endogenous serum creatinine and by creatinine clearance 
these diagnostic assays may overestimate kidney function by as much as in some patients 
we believe that the use of renal filtration markers  such as glofil or inulin  offer a more accurate and direct means of determining gfr  and thereby result in better clinical decision making 
glofil and inulin are fda approved products for the measurement of gfr 
nephrology  transplant  oncology and nuclear medicine departments at major medical centers are the primary users of these products 
glofil is an injectable radioisotope diagnostic agent  which provides rapid information on gfr with great accuracy 
inulin is a non radioisotope injectable diagnostic agent  which provides a measure of gfr 
we believe that there is an opportunity for increased utilization of glofil present diagnostic procedures for measuring kidney function include serum creatinine and creatinine clearance tests 
these two tests are the most commonly performed methods of measuring kidney function because of their low cost  however  both methods may significantly overestimate kidney function in the estimated  patients with severe renal disease 
the utility of glofil has been established in published clinical studies as being a more direct  accurate measure of kidney function  yielding much more reliable results than serum creatinine or creatinine clearance tests 
this improved accuracy can be essential in monitoring disease progression and implementing appropriate interventions and assessing the degree of success of kidney grafts  post transplant 
we believe that as new interventional therapies emerge  such as the use of angiotensin converting enzyme ace inhibitors to slow down disease progression and the modification of diet in renal disease mdrd  for the treatment of early stage renal disease  the use of glofil will take on much greater importance  however  at this point  most early stage patients are not felt to require this degree of accuracy in the determination of renal function 
glofil has also been used in clinical trials administered by the national institutes of health nih 
use of glofil in clinical trials can provide the trial administrators with an accurate measure of kidney function and show the effects of the drug being studied on normal kidney function 
glofil has been included in several recent clinical trials administered by the nih 
one of these trials ended in the third quarter of in december  we received notice that glofil had been accepted as the gfr marker for an upcoming nih trial entitled the chronic renal insufficiency cohort cric trial 
this study  which is scheduled to commence by mid year  will enroll  people who are at risk for developing compromised renal function and follow them over a five year period 
we believe that the incorporation of glofil into the cric study is confirmation that patients who are at risk for impaired kidney function should have their gfr measured accurately  and that glofil is the preferred marker for that assessment 
we plan to continue to promote the use of glofil to the nih and to large pharmaceutical companies for use in clinical trials as a means of detecting kidney toxicity and measuring overall kidney function 
although we believe that glofil may be used in clinical trials in the future  there can be no assurance that glofil will be included in any clinical protocol or  if it is included  that we will receive significant revenues from the future sales of glofil the biggest impediment to the growth in the sales of glofil is the lack of availability of the test to practicing clinicians 
routine testing with glofil requires dedicated laboratory facilities and trained technicians 
our efforts are focused on establishing testing sites in major market areas in the us we are not aware of any new diagnostic agents that would pose a competitive threat to glofil at this time 
inulin  which is also sold by us  is an alternative agent for gfr measurement 
however  the preparation and use of inulin is time consuming and it does not provide the practical advantages of glofil the use of and demand for inulin is relatively limited 
we do not expect revenues from the sale of inulin to increase in the future 
due to manufacturing issues with inulin that emerged in mid  and that remain unresolved at this time  we do not expect any revenues from inulin during the first half of if we are unable to resolve the outstanding issues related to the ongoing manufacturing of inulin  we may experience a product shortage for an extended period of time 

table of contents vsl we acquired the us promotion rights for vsl under an agreement effective january vsl is a patented probiotic preparation of eight live freeze dried lactic acid bacterial species 
probiotics are living organisms in foods and dietary supplements  which  upon ingestion in certain numbers  improve the health of the host beyond their inherent basic nutrition 
we formally launched vsl to the market as a dietary supplement to promote normal gastrointestinal gi function at the annual digestive disease week meeting in may we believe the emerging role for probiotics in the management of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases ibds offers an attractive market opportunity for vsl while at the same time effectively complements the current promotion of ethamolin to this same group of gastroenterologists 
ibd is one of the most common chronic gastrointestinal illnesses and consists mainly of two conditions ulcerative colitis and crohn s disease 
it is estimated that almost one million americans have ibd  with roughly due to ulcerative colitis and due to crohn s disease 
about of ulcerative colitis patients eventually must have their colon removed because of massive bleeding  severe illness  rupture of the colon  or risk of cancer 
a number of surgeries may be performed for ulcerative colitis 
one such procedure  which is becoming increasingly common for ulcerative colitis  is ileal pouch anal anastomosis ipaa surgery 
this operation allows the patient to have relatively normal bowel movements because it preserves part of the rectum 
the major long term complication that occurs as a result of this surgery is pouchitis 
pouchitis is the non specific inflammation of the ileal reservoir that appears to be associated with bacterial overgrowth and dysbiosis 
published clinical trials reported that vsl is effective in preventing flare ups of chronic pouchitis 
in one particular study regarding chronic pouchitis  conducted by dr 
paolo gionchetti  et al  and discussed in the us peer reviewed clinical journal of gastroenterology and hepatology   vsl has been effective in preventing chronic pouchitis 
in this study  the efficacy of vsl was compared with a placebo in patients who had undergone the ipaa surgical procedure and had achieved clinical and endoscopic remission from chronic pouchitis after antibiotic treatment 
of the patients who received the placebo  all had a relapse of pouchitis during the nine month study period 
of the patients that received vsl  were still in remission at nine months post treatment 
no side effects were observed from the treatment with vsl vsl has received orphan drug designation from the office of orphan products development at the fda for two indications the treatment of active chronic pouchitis  and the prevention of disease relapse in patients with chronic pouchitis 
orphan drug designation applies to diseases and disease states with a prevalence of less than  patients in the us orphan drug designation confers certain protection such as market exclusivity for seven years once the product has been approved 
for vsl pharmaceuticals and us to take advantage of this designation  vsl would have to be approved as a new biological product by the fda 
we do not control the clinical development strategy for vsl there can be no assurance that vsl will ever be approved as a new biological product by the fda or that it will ever enjoy the benefits of this orphan drug designation 
drug development our development stage products include the intranasal drugs emitasol  hypnostat  panistat and the glial excitotoxin release inhibitors 
intranasal drugs emitasol through our merger with ribogene  inc  we acquired emitasol  an intranasal form of metoclopramide 
metoclopramide is an approved antiemetic and is available in both oral and intravenous forms to treat diabetic gastroparesis and to prevent acute chemotherapy induced emesis 
we  through future strategic partners  may also choose to investigate emitasol for the treatment of diabetic gastroparesis and delayed onset emesis nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy 

table of contents emitasol is currently being developed and marketed in certain countries throughout the world through corporate partners 
it is on the market in italy as pramidin  and during was distributed by sirton pharmaceuticals spa sirton under our existing license agreement in italy for the treatment of a variety of gastrointestinal disorders and emesis 
for the year ended december   sirton distributed approximately  units of pramidin in italy 
this agreement expired in accordance with terms in june and is currently being renegotiated for the purpose of continuing the relationship 
we entered into a marketing agreement in december with ahn gook pharmaceuticals ahn gook  for intranasal metoclopramide  to be marketed under the trade name emitasol  in korea 
ahn gook also signed an agreement with sirton to obtain the intranasal metoclopramide finished product 
emitasol has been filed and approved in korea  and will be distributed by ahn gook in korea for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders and emesis 
in the us  emitasol is proposed as a method to control diabetic gastroparesis and to prevent delayed onset emesis associated with cancer chemotherapy 
currently  there are no drugs specifically approved to treat delayed onset emesis 
however  on march   fda s gastrointestinal drugs advisory committee recommended that the fda approve merck s emend aprepitant with ht antagonist for various indications  including delayed onset emesis 
we believe that emitasol  when given intranasally  may be effective in preventing delayed onset emesis 
advantages may include ease of administration  an increased level of efficacy as compared to alternatives  and cost effectiveness 
diabetic gastroparesis 
we  together with our former north american collaborative partner shire pharmaceuticals group plc shire  also see strategic alliances and collaborations  concluded a us phase ii clinical trial using patients with diabetic gastroparesis in the fourth quarter of for some diabetics  proper digestion may be difficult 
variable blood glucose levels may lead to a condition known as gastroparesis or stomach paralysis 
gastroparesis can result in general loss of appetite  nausea and vomiting  and in some cases severe dehydration 
many prescription medications are used to treat gastroparesis  including bethanchol and erythromycin 
each of these prescription drugs has limited effectiveness and potential and significant side effects 
metoclopramide is approved for treating gastroparesis 
we believe that the intranasal form of metoclopramide may provide diabetics who have gastroparesis with an easier route of administration  resulting in better patient compliance 
in october  we announced the results of the phase ii study of emitasol metoclopramide nasal spray in patients with diabetic gastroparesis 
the study showed that both emitasol metoclopramide nasal spray and oral metoclopramide were bioavailable when administered to diabetic gastroparesis patients 
the trial also suggested that emitasol metoclopramide nasal spray treatment may enhance the clinical response versus oral metoclopramide 
in july  shire s exclusive option to develop and market emitasol in north america expired and all rights were returned to us 
we currently are seeking a corporate partner for the development of emitasol in the us and in other countries around the world 
delayed onset emesis 
according to the american cancer society  about million new patients are diagnosed with cancer in the us each year  many of whom are treated with chemotherapy 
nausea and vomiting emesis are common side effects of cancer chemotherapy 
chemotherapy induced emesis is considered to occur in two phases acute within hours of the initiation of chemotherapy and delayed on the second and subsequent days 
several drugs have been approved by the fda for preventing nausea and vomiting associated with emetogenic chemotherapy  including injectable forms of ondansetron  granisetron and metoclopramide 
ondansetron and granisetron are representatives of a newer class of drugs called serotonin antagonists or setrons  and are considered highly effective in controlling acute chemotherapy induced emesis 
there are conflicting reports  however  about the efficacy of serotonin antagonists in controlling delayed onset emesis 
there are  in fact  no fda approved treatments specifically for delayed onset emesis 
increasing numbers of these patients are being treated as outpatients and experience delayed onset emesis when they are no longer under the immediate care of a medical professional 
any medication for such emetic episodes should therefore be suitable for self administration by the patient 
injectable medications are unlikely to be suitable in this context 
it appears that current practice is to provide patients initially with oral antiemetics in tablet form 
tablets are not  however  particularly suitable for patients who are nauseated and may vomit 

table of contents prior clinical trials for emitasol have demonstrated that metoclopramide is absorbed and effective when given intranasally 
phase i trials indicated that the overall amount of metoclopramide which reaches the plasma is very similar whether the drug is given intranasally  intravenously or orally 
given the similarity in uptake of the three dosage forms  similarity might also be expected in their clinical performance 
for acute emesis  the expected similarity in performance has been demonstrated for the intranasal and intravenous dosage forms 
in a prior phase iii study  emitasol provided protection against acute emesis comparable to that previously reported for intravenous metoclopramide 
we therefore anticipate that intranasal metoclopramide may be effective for controlling delayed onset emesis  an activity suggested for oral metoclopramide in the clinical literature 
regardless of which indication is selected for emitasol  substantial additional development  clinical testing potentially including one or more phase iii trials and investment will be required prior to seeking regulatory approval for commercialization of this product in the us there can be no assurance that a phase iii clinical trial of emitasol will demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the product to the extent necessary to obtain regulatory approvals for the indications being studied  or at all 
the failure to demonstrate adequately the safety and efficacy of emitasol could delay or prevent regulatory approval of the product 
hypnostat through our merger with ribogene  we acquired hypnostat  an intranasal form of triazolam 
oral triazolam is approved for short term treatment of insomnia 
in june  we signed a letter of understanding with fabre kramer of houston  tx  to jointly pursue the worldwide development and commercialization of hypnostat intranasal triazolam for insomnia and panistat intranasal alprazolam for panic disorders  two of our intranasal product candidates 
under this agreement  we were reimbursed  in for consultants  employees  materials and supplies expenses related to this project 
in  we were reimbursed  for patent expenses under the agreement 
this original agreement was replaced with a new letter of understanding  in january  and in june  we entered into a license agreement with fabre kramer for the development of hypnostat and panistat to be funded by fabre kramer 
fabre kramer is developing hypnostat for the short term treatment of insomnia 
we believe that hypnostat  when given intranasally  may be effective in treating insomnia 
advantages may include ease of administration  an increased level of efficacy as compared to alternatives  cost effectiveness  and possibly reduced side effects 
the potential advantages of hypnostat are significant in light of the fact that thirty to forty million americans suffer from serious sleep disorders which are often untreated or inadequately treated 
continued sleep impairment may cause severe health effects 
oral triazolam halcion has been one of the most successful and most prescribed sleep inducing agents in the world  with over billion prescriptions filled 
oral triazolam is considered safer in terms of overdose  drug interactions  and addictive potential as compared to barbiturates 
in addition  oral triazolam produces less morning grogginess  as compared to other benzodiazepines 
oral triazolam and other benzodiazepines are recommended for short term use in conservative doses 
zolpidem ambien and zaleplon sonata are newer hypnosedative agents that are chemically unrelated to benzodiazepines 
however  both zolpidem and zaleplon have similar pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects and do not differ with respect to efficacy  tolerability  residual effects  memory impairment  rebound insomnia  or abuse potential compared to oral triazolam 
over the counter medications containing diphenhydramine such as benadryl and sominex have been shown to increase the risk of symptoms of delirium including disorganized speech  poor attention level  and altered consciousness in the elderly 
other over the counter medications such as valerian and melatonin may be useful in alleviating mild short term insomnia  but further clinical trials are required to fully evaluate efficacy and safety 
prior clinical trials for hypnostat support that triazolam is absorbed and effective when given intranasally 
phase i trials indicated that the overall amount of triazolam which reaches the plasma is very similar whether the drug is given intranasally or orally 
given the similarity in uptake of the two dosage forms  similarity might also be expected in their clinical performance 
the expected similarity in performance is supported for the intranasal dosage form 
in a prior phase ii pilot study  hypnostat at mg was superior to oral triazolam at mg for time to sleep onset p  effective sleep time p  and stage two sleep time p and was equivalent to oral triazolam at mg for quality of sleep 
we therefore anticipate that 
table of contents intranasal triazolam may be effective for treating insomnia 
the drug is currently in the phase ii stage of development 
panistat also  through our merger with ribogene  we acquired panistat  an intranasal form of alprazolam 
oral alprazolam is approved for the management of panic disorder or the short term relief of anxiety symptoms 
fabre kramer intends to develop panistat for the management of panic disorder or the short term relief of anxiety symptoms 
we believe that panistat  when given intranasally  may be effective in treating panic disorders 
advantages may include ease of administration  an increased level of efficacy as compared to alternatives  and cost effectiveness 
the potential advantages of panistat are significant in light of the fact that anxiety disorders are the most common mental disorder in the us  affecting approximately million people 
according to the national institute of mental health  approximately of those affected seek treatment 
generalized anxiety disorder is characterized by constant uncontrollable worry 
panic disorder is characterized by acute  spontaneous  and repeated anxiety attacks which involve an intense  terrifying  and unfocused fear in the absence of any external threat 
panic attacks typically last for approximately to minutes and may cause racing heartbeat  chest pains  difficulty breathing  choking sensations  dizziness  and numbness 
panic attacks can occur as often as several times per week or several times per day 
approximately million people in the us suffer from panic disorder  which often progresses into chronic anxiety and agoraphobia 
early treatment can help keep a panic disorder from progressing 
benzodiazepines  including oral alprazolam xanax  have proven to be safe and effective for treating panic disorder for over years 
benzodiazepines block panic attacks during the first or second day of treatment 
surprisingly low rates of abuse of this and other medicines are reported in persons with panic disorder 
many antidepressants  including doxepin sinequan  sertraline zoloft  fluoxetine prozac  imipramine tofranil  and paroxetine hydrochloride paxil  are useful in treating panic attacks without causing physical dependence 
however  successful treatment requires full strength dosage and usually takes four to eight weeks for therapeutic effects to be observed 
in addition  antidepressants cause panic attacks to initially increase in approximately half of panic disorder sufferers 
as a rule  the less expensive antidepressants have more side effects than the newer  more expensive ones 
phenelzine sulfate nardil is effective for panic disorder  but is complicated to use 
although phenelzine sulfate is safe when used by an experienced physician  it is typically reserved for cases where simpler medications have failed or cannot be used 
unsafe elevations of blood pressure for several hours can occur if one does not adhere to diet and medication restrictions 
cognitive behavioral therapy cbt teaches the patient to anticipate and prepare for situations and bodily sensations that may trigger panic attacks 
cbt generally requires at least eight to twelve weeks for the patient to learn the skills and put them into practice 
cbt requires a motivated patient and a specially trained therapist 
clinical experience suggests that for many patients with panic disorder  a combination of cbt and medication may be the best treatment 
other treatment options include relaxation  breathing techniques  hypnotherapy  and psychotherapy 
to date  no clinical work has been performed on panistat 
glial excitotoxin release inhibitors geris the geris series are neuroprotective compounds that may prevent ischemic brain damage originating from astrocytes astroglial cells 
astrocytes serve important metabolic functions and are thought to be responsible for the bulk of brain swelling following stroke or injury 
the swelling constricts blood vessels and worsens the injury resulting in ischemia and subsequent cell death 
in addition  upon onset of ischemia  astrocytes release excitotoxins such as glutamate and aspartate over an extended period of time not rapidly  as in the case of neurons that result in significant and persistent damage to neurons 
because astrocyte swelling and excitotoxin releases are late stage events in the development of ischemia following brain injury or stroke  they may be more appropriate targets for drug intervention than neuron related events 
in animal models and cell culture experiments  the geri compounds exert a powerful neuroprotective effect by blocking chloride ion channels  to reduce swelling  and by inhibiting excitotoxin release  to limit or 
table of contents prevent damage to neurons 
in vitro  excitotoxin release from cultured astrocytoma cells is fully inhibited at very low concentrations by many compounds of the geri series 
a greater than fold decrease in drug concentration required to inhibit excitotoxin release has been achieved by designing novel derivatives in the geri compound family 
in animal models of global and focal brain ischemia  a number of the geri compounds demonstrated reduction of the infarct volume by as much as in comparison to untreated controls 
in addition  the toxicity profile of existing development candidates appears excellent 
the geri compounds are currently being funded by a small business innovation research sbir grant from the nih 
it is anticipated that reimbursement under this grant will be completed in april although we have had some preliminary discussions with potential corporate partners regarding the geri compounds  there can be no assurance that we will enter into a collaboration to fund future research on these compounds 
pending completion of the reimbursement under the existing sbir grant  we do not intend to expend any additional resources on these compounds 
at this time  we continue to define the chemical  toxicological and pharmacological effect of a number of geri compounds in animal models having utilized  through december  of the  in funding from an nih sbir grant 
funding for this project expires in april there can be no assurance that we will be successful in licensing the geri program or that we will realize license fees or revenues from such programs 
strategic alliances and collaborations drug discovery subsequent to our merger with ribogene  we implemented a strategy to focus on the sales and marketing of approved pharmaceutical products and late stage drug development candidates 
as a result  we planned to out license our early stage drug targets and technology 
thus  we discontinued our drug discovery programs in the first quarter of and anticipate that future in house drug discovery research expenses associated with drug discovery will be limited to legal fees  patent costs and other costs to license such programs 
the dainippon agreement we have an exclusive  worldwide license agreement with dainippon to use our antibacterial peptide deformylase and ppgpp degradase technology for the research  development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products 
we have retained the right to co promote  in europe and the us  certain products resulting from the arrangement 
we will be entitled to receive potential milestone payments upon the achievement of clinical and regulatory milestones in the amount of million in japan and million in one other major market 
we will receive a potential royalty on net sales that will range from to  depending on sales volume and territory 
dainippon has been conducting research on two specific bacterial targets  peptide deformylase and ppgpp degradase 
to date  dainippon has focused most of their efforts on the deformylase project 
several compounds have been synthesized and tested in vivo against drug resistant bacteria 
although the compounds have shown good in vivo activity  dainippon has not selected any compounds for clinical studies in animals 
there can be no assurance that dainippon will ever select any compounds for preclinical studies or if selected that these compounds will eventually be approved as drugs 
there can also be no assurance that we will ever receive any milestone payments or royalties under our agreement with dainippon 
the rigel pharmaceuticals agreement we have an exclusive agreement with rigel pharmaceuticals  inc rigel  to use our antiviral technology 
under the agreement  we have assigned to rigel certain antiviral technology  including our hepatitis c virus internal ribosome entry site and nsa drug discovery technology  for the research  development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products 
we will be entitled to potential future milestone payments upon the achievement of certain clinical and regulatory milestones and royalty payments 
table of contents on sales 
the status of this project is on going at rigel 
there can also be no assurance that we will ever receive any milestone payments or royalties under our agreement with rigel 
the tularik agreement in february  we announced that we had exclusively licensed certain antifungal drug research technology to tularik  inc in addition  we have transferred to tularik certain biological and chemical reagents to be used in the discovery and development of novel antifungal agents 
in exchange  we received a cash payment  payment for reimbursement of patent expenses  and will be entitled to future potential milestone payments upon the achievement of certain clinical and regulatory milestones as well as royalty payments on sales 
tularik has screened numerous compounds through the antifungal capping assay that it acquired as part of this agreement 
several of these compounds have been identified as having activity against c 
albicans capping enzymes 
tularik has transferred intellectual and physical assets to cumbre inc  a subsidiary of tularik 
there can also be no assurance that we will ever receive any milestone payments or royalties under our agreement with tularik 
drug development the shire pharmaceuticals group plc agreement in july  the option held by shire pharmaceuticals group to acquire exclusive rights to emitasol in north america expired and all rights reverted to us 
the fabre kramer pharmaceuticals license agreement in june  we signed an exclusive worldwide license agreement with fabre kramer of houston  tx  to commercialize two of our product candidates  hypnostat intranasal triazolam for insomnia and panistat intranasal alprazolam for panic disorders 
immediately after the agreement was signed we received a cash payment of  for the transfer of all technology related to the products 
we are entitled to future payments from fabre kramer when specific developmental milestones are met 
in addition  we are entitled to receive royalty payments from worldwide product related revenues  based on a percentage of total revenues 
this license agreement is the final result of the letter of understanding originally signed in june and modified in january under the license agreement  fabre kramer will immediately assume the primary responsibility for the development of hypnostat and panistat 
licenses and distribution agreements csc pharmaceuticals handels gmbh csc 
in april  ribogene entered into an agreement with csc 
the agreement grants csc an exclusive license to market and sell emitasol in austria  poland  the czech republic  bulgaria  russia  hungary  the slovak republic  romania  and the remaining community of independent states and eight other eastern european countries 
csc has agreed to pay us a royalty based on net sales within the countries listed above 
the agreement will expire on a country by country basis years after the first commercial sale in that country 
although we can terminate the license if csc did not obtain approval in any country contained in the agreement by april   we have not done so  since csc has filed for regulatory approval in austria  russia  hungary and the slovak republic 
in  csc received approval to market emitasol in poland and the czech republic 
csc has also filed for approval in several other countries 
as of the end of  csc has not begun marketing emitasol in poland and the czech republic 
it is difficult to predict when  if ever  csc will begin to market this product in their approved territories 
laboratorios silesia sa 
in december  we signed a license agreement with laboratorios silesia sa for marketing intranasal metoclopramide  to be marketed under the trade name emitasol  in chile 
laboratories silesia sa also signed an agreement with sirton to obtain the intranasal metoclopramide  finished product under the trade name pramidin 
this product is marketed as pramidin in italy 
we received a small up front payment and will receive royalties on the net sales of emitasol in the territory 

table of contents ahn gook pharmaceutical co  ltd 
we entered into a license agreement in december and amended in december with ahn gook for marketing intranasal metoclopramide  to be marketed under the trade name emitasol  in korea 
ahn gook expects to begin sales of emitasol in the republic of korea in the first half of ahn gook intends to manufacture emitasol themselves in korea 
ahn gook received government approval to market emitasol in we received an up front cash payment of  in and a milestone payment of  in upon transfer of technology and will earn future royalties based on actual sales in korea 
in december  we expanded the license agreement to include twelve additional countries in asia and since we have no future obligations  we recognized  in revenues related to the up front cash payment and milestone payment under the agreement 
we will receive an upfront payment and additional royalties upon commercialization of emitasol in each of these new countries 
manufacturing we do not currently manufacture any of our acquired products or our products in development 
our commercial products  acthar  ethamolin  vsl  glofil  and inulin are manufactured for us by approved contract manufacturers 
as part of our agreement with aventis to acquire acthar  aventis agreed to manufacture the finished goods from existing inventory of the active pharmaceutical ingredient the api through july aventis has provided finished product under the terms of the acquisition that will meet our forecasted demand through late the production of acthar requires the production of the api and the production of the finished product 
the api is an extraction from porcine pituitary glands 
although the extraction process is well known by individuals within aventis  the extraction may be difficult to reproduce at a new vendor 
under our agreement we are committed to purchase the api and other inventory residing at aventis 
we believe this api will meet our forecasted demand through we are required to transfer the manufacturing process to a new third party manufacturer to produce the api and for the production of the finished goods 
we have identified potential third party manufacturers that could produce the api but we have not yet entered into an agreement with any of these manufacturers 
we have identified the third party manufacturer for the finished product and are in final contract negotiations 
the manufacturing transfer of the finished product is well underway 
we expect to convert aventis api to finished product at the new site during the production of the api and the finished product are subject to inspection and ultimate approval by the fda 
while we have reviewed our plans and progress to date with the fda  and received a positive response  additional approvals will be required through the transfer process 
on november   we met with the fda to discuss our manufacturing transfer plan for acthar 
in connection with that meeting  the fda approved our supplemental new drug application filed on september  to extend the labeled shelf life of acthar from twelve months to eighteen months from the date of manufacture 
we released a lot of acthar with month dating in the acthar site transfer process has numerous risks that could have a materially adverse impact on our financial results in future years 
such risks include the ability to enter into agreements with new independent third party contractors for the production of the api and the production of finished goods  or  if we are successful in identifying and entering into such agreements that the api and finished goods could be produced in sufficient quantities on a timely basis and at an acceptable cost  that the production facilities and the processes will be approved by the fda and that the api and finished product will be similar in potency and efficacy as the api currently held by aventis 
although we believe we have adequate time and resources to ensure that the site transfer of acthar will occur timely and correctly with minimal impact on future revenues  there can be no assurance that the site transfer will occur timely and correctly and that the transfer will not have a materially adverse impact on the company in the future 
during  we successfully transferred manufacturing of ethamolin from schering plough to ben venue laboratories ben venue 
full fda approval for the transfer to ben venue was obtained on september  ben venue manufacturers ethamolin for us on a purchase order basis 
currently we have sufficient product on hand to cover demand through 
table of contents in the case of vsl  we obtain the product from vsl under our agreement 
however  we have no experience with manufacturing vsl  and we are relying completely on vsl to supply us with the product 
due to our lack of experience with vsl and our reliance on vsl  we can provide no assurances as to the timely manufacture of this product 
our manufacturer of glofil was subject to an inspection by the fda 
as a result of this inspection  our manufacturer received notification that numerous items required attention in order to comply with fda regulations 
the open items from the inspection have subsequently been addressed 
based on the information available  we believe that the manufacture of glofil will not be affected 
in the case of inulin  we are responsible for obtaining the bulk drug from a third party and delivering it to the finished goods manufacturer 
due to manufacturing issues with inulin that emerged in mid  and that remain unresolved at this time  we had a backorder situation which resulted in lost revenue for the year ending december  as a result we do not expect any revenues from inulin during the first half of if we are unable to resolve the outstanding issues related to the ongoing manufacturing of inulin  we may experience a product shortage for an extended period of time 
there can be no assurance that any of our bulk or finished goods contract manufacturers will continue to meet our requirements for quality  quantity and timeliness or the fda s current good manufacturing practice cgmp requirements 
also  there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete qualification of new vendors for acthar or a substitute finished goods manufacturer for acthar  nor that our contract manufacturers will be able to meet all cgmp requirements  nor that lots will not have to be recalled with the attendant financial consequences to us 
our dependence upon others for the manufacture of bulk or finished forms of our products may adversely affect the future profit margin on the sale of those products and our ability to develop and deliver products on a timely and competitive basis 
we do not have substitute suppliers for any of our products although we strive to plan appropriately and maintain safety stocks of product to cover unforeseen events at manufacturing sites 
in the event we are unable to manufacture our products  either directly or indirectly through others or on commercially acceptable terms  if at all  we may not be able to commercialize our products as planned 
sales and marketing as of december   we have hired  trained and deployed a total of product specialists and marketing personnel to support the commercial sales of acthar  ethamolin  vsl  glofil and inulin 
our promotion of acthar is focused on pediatric neurologists and on a small group of general neurologists who have a special interest in multiple sclerosis 
vsl and ethamolin are promoted to a group of gastroenterologists who treat patients with liver disease and inflammatory bowel disease 
vsl is marketed as a dietary supplement while ethamolin is an fda approved product for the specific indication of esophageal varices that have recently bled 
the promotion of glofil targets organ transplant centers and those patients who are at greatest risk of kidney failure 
international distribution agreements orphan australia in august we signed an agreement with orphan australia of melbourne  australia for the exclusive marketing and distribution of acthar and ethamolin in australia and new zealand 
beacon pharmaceuticals  ltd 
in october we signed an agreement with beacon pharmaceuticals  ltd 
of tunbridge wells  kent  uk  for the exclusive marketing and distribution of acthar in the united kingdom 

table of contents competition the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change 
a number of companies are pursuing the development of pharmaceuticals and products which target the same diseases and conditions that we will target 
for example  there are products and treatments on the market that compete with acthar  ethamolin  glofil  inulin  and vsl moreover  technology controlled by third parties that may be advantageous to our business may be acquired or licensed by competitors of ours  preventing us from obtaining this technology on favorable terms  or at all 
our ability to compete will depend on our ability to acquire and commercialize pharmaceutical products that address critical medical needs  as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel  and secure sufficient capital resources for the acquisition of products 
acthar is currently used in patients suffering from arthritis  multiple sclerosis  and infantile spasm 
acthar may be challenged by newer agents  such as synthetic corticosteriods  immune system suppressants known as immunosuppressants  and anti seizure medications in the case of infantile spasms and other types of anti inflammatory products for various autoimmune conditions that have inflammation as a clinical aspect of the disease 
several companies may offer sclerotherapy agents chemicals injected into varicose veins that damage and scar the inside lining of the vein  causing it to close that compete with ethamolin 
other competitive agents include scleromate tm an injectable agent used to treat varicose veins and spider veins  rubber band ligation methods procedures in which bleeding esophageal varices are tied off at their base with rubber bands  cutting off the blood flow such as the multi band superview manufactured by boston scientific  the multi band six shooter manufactured by wilson cook  and the multi band ligator manufactured by bard 
other products may reduce the number of bleeding esophageal varices by lowering portal hypertension  such as sandostatin manufactured by novartis 
the competition to market fda approved active bleeding esophageal varices therapies is intense 
there are numerous products that may be viewed as competitors to glofil these include intrinsic tests  such as serum creatinine tests and creatinine clearance tests  both of which are used to measure how quickly the kidneys are able to clear creatinine  an endogenously produced chemical from the blood 
extrinsic tests use such products as tc dtpa  manufactured by mallinckrodt  inc  omnipaque an injectable contrast media agent  manufactured by sanofi  a division of sanofi synthelabo  and conray iothalamate meglumine another injectable contrast medium  manufactured by mallinckrodt  inc there is intense competition among both fda and non fda approved products to measure kidney function 
virtually any number of manufacturers of probiotics may be considered competitors to vsl among the most notable are culturelle tm by conagra and probiotica  by johnson and johnson 
most of our competitors are larger than us and have substantially greater financial  marketing and technical resources than we have 
in addition  many of these competitors have substantially greater experience than we do in acquiring  developing  testing and obtaining fda and other approvals of pharmaceuticals 
furthermore  if we commence commercial sales of products that are currently in the development stage  we will also be competing with respect to manufacturing efficiency and marketing capabilities  areas in which we have limited experience 
if any of the competitors develop new products that are superior to our products  our ability to expand into the pharmaceutical markets may be materially and adversely affected 
competition among products will be based  among other things  on product efficacy  safety  reliability  availability  price and patent position 
an important factor will be the timing of market introduction of our or our competitors products 
accordingly  the relative speed with which we can acquire products and supply commercial quantities of the products to the market is expected to be an important competitive factor 
our competitive position will also depend upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel and to secure sufficient capital resources for product acquisition and commercialization of products 

table of contents government regulation marketed pharmaceutical products all pharmaceutical firms  including manufacturers from whom we purchase products  are subject to regulation by the fda 
any restrictions or prohibitions applicable to sales of products we market could materially and adversely affect our business 
we market prescription drug products that have been approved by the fda 
the fda has the authority to revoke existing approvals if new information reveals that they are not safe or effective 
the fda also regulates the promotion  including advertisement  of prescription drugs 
drug products must be manufactured  packaged  and labeled in accordance with their approvals and in conformity with cgmp standards and other requirements 
drug manufacturing facilities must be registered with and approved by the fda and must list with the fda the drug products they intend to manufacture or distribute 
the manufacturer is subject to inspections by the fda and periodic inspections by other regulatory agencies 
the fda has extensive enforcement powers over the activities of pharmaceutical manufacturers  including authority to seize and prohibit the sale of unapproved or non complying products  and to halt manufacturing operations that are not in compliance with current cgmps 
the fda may impose criminal penalties arising from non compliance with applicable regulations 
drugs in development our products in development through our partners are subject to extensive regulation by the us principally under the federal food  drug and cosmetic act fdca and the public health service act  and foreign governmental authorities prior to commercialization 
in particular  drugs and biological products are subject to rigorous preclinical and clinical testing and other approval requirements by the fda  state and local authorities and comparable foreign regulatory authorities 
the process for obtaining the required regulatory approvals from the fda and other regulatory authorities takes many years and is very expensive 
there can be no assurance that any product developed by us or our development partners will prove to meet all of the applicable standards to receive marketing approval in the us or abroad 
there can be no assurance that these approvals will be granted on a timely basis  if at all 
delays and costs in obtaining these approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal  state and local statutes and regulations could materially adversely affect our ability to commercialize our products and our ability to earn sales revenues 
vsl we are marketing vsl as a dietary supplement 
if approval of vsl as a biological product is pursued by vsl at a later date  the regulatory hurdles discussed above will apply 
the manufacturing  distribution  and sale of dietary supplements and medical foods are subject to regulation by one or more federal agencies  principally the fda and the federal trade commission the ftc 
our activities are also regulated by various governmental agencies for the states and localities in which vsl is distributed and sold 
among other matters  the fda and ftc are concerned with product safety and claims that refer to a product s ability to provide dietary support for health related conditions 
the regulation of dietary supplements is principally governed by the dietary supplement health and education act dshea  which were enacted in  amending the fdca 
we believe dshea is generally favorable to the dietary supplement industry 
dshea establishes a statutory class of dietary supplements  which includes vitamins  minerals  herbs  amino acids and other dietary ingredients for human use to supplement the diet 
dietary ingredients that were not on the market as of october  require the submission by the manufacturer or distributor to the fda of evidence of a history of use or other evidence of safety establishing that the ingredient will reasonably be expected to be safe 
among other things  dshea prevents the further regulation of dietary ingredients as food additives and allows the use of statements of nutritional support on product labels 
the fda has issued proposed and final regulations in this area and indicates that further guidance and regulations are forthcoming 

table of contents the fda has announced its intent to issue cgmp regulations for the dietary supplement industry 
the fda has published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking  and on march  published proposed regulations 
in november  the ftc bureau of consumer protection announced its new advertising guidelines for the dietary supplement industry  which it labeled dietary supplements an advertising guide for industry 
these guidelines reiterate many of the policies the ftc has announced over the years  including requirements for substantiation of claims made in advertising about dietary supplements 
patents and proprietary rights our success may depend in part upon our ability to maintain confidentiality  operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of third parties  and obtain patent protection for our products 
we have obtained patent coverage  either directly or through licenses from third parties  for some of our products in development or marketed overseas 
we currently own or have licensed a total of eighteen issued us and foreign patents covering hypnostat  five issued us and foreign patents covering emitasol  one issued us patent covering geri  and eleven issued us and foreign patents covering our other technology 
we acquired intellectual property associated with our intranasal program  including emitasol for diabetic gastroparesis and delayed onset emesis associated with chemotherapy  migrastat intranasal propranolol for migraine treatment  and intranasal benzodiazepines such as hypnostat and panistat for various conditions such as anxiety  seizures  panic attacks and sleep disorders 
we have licensed rights to intranasal metoclopramide in  italy  chile  south korea  austria  the russian federation  asia excluding japan and certain former eastern european countries 
the former italian licensee  sirton  received approval to market intranasal metoclopramide pramidin in italy 
the agreement with sirton expired according to terms in june and is currently being renegotiated for the purpose of continuing the relationship 
we are currently earning small royalties on our sales of pramidin 
there can be no assurance that the foreign licensees will obtain the necessary regulatory approvals to market emitasol  or that  in the event such approvals are obtained  emitasol will achieve market acceptance in such countries  or that we will ever realize royalties on sales of emitasol in such countries 
we have also filed several other patent applications in the us and abroad on our various products and expect to file additional applications in the future 
employees at december   we had full time employees as compared to full time employees at december  
our success will depend in large part on our ability to attract and retain key employees

table of contents risk factors we have a history of operating losses and may never generate sufficient revenue to achieve profitability 
we have a history of recurring operating losses 
our operating losses from inception through december  were million  of which million represented the loss for the year ended december  and million represented the loss for the year ended december  further substantial operating losses are expected to continue at least through the end of to date  our revenues have been generated principally from sales of acthar  ethamolin  glofil  inulin and vsl we do not expect hypnostat  panistat  or the geri compounds to be commercially available for a number of years  if at all 
further  revenues from the sale of emitasol  if any  will also be dependent on fda approval and the development of emitasol in conjunction with a new strategic partner  which has not yet been obtained 
our ability to achieve a consistent  profitable level of operations will be dependent in large part upon our ability to finance and acquire additional marketed products  increase sales of current products  finance the future growth of our sales marketing and customer service organization  finance operations with external capital until positive cash flows are achieved  enter into agreements with corporate partners for the development of emitasol  properly and timely perform the transfer of the manufacturing of acthar to new contract manufacturers including receiving the appropriate approvals from the fda and other regulatory authorities  and continue to receive products from our sole source contract manufacturers on a timely basis and at acceptable costs 
if we are unable to generate sufficient revenues from the sale of our products  or if we are unable to contain costs and expenses  we may not achieve profitability and may ultimately be unable to fund our operations 
if our revenues from sales of acthar decline  we may not have sufficient revenues to fund our operations 
we rely heavily on sales of acthar 
acthar revenues comprised and of our total product revenues for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
we review external data sources to estimate customer demand for our products 
in the event that demand for our products is less than our sales to wholesalers  excess inventory may result at the wholesaler level  which may impact future product sales 
if the supply of acthar available at the wholesalers exceeds the future demand  our future revenues from the sales of acthar may be affected adversely 
in december  we noted that certain customers were not complying with our exchange policy 
these customers were deducting from amounts owed to us for the full price of expired acthar they planned to return to us 
we reached an agreement with these customers to reverse the short remittances and to accept replacement product 
certain customers received a one time replacement rebate from us 
in addition  we will provide replacement vials at no cost for the remaining on hand inventories of acthar that expired in november and will do so again for the acthar that expires in may in the first quarter of  due to the relatively short dating of acthar in our inventories and at the wholesale level  we limited acthar shipments to critical care and emergency situations 
a lot of acthar  with the new month dating was released in the first quarter of with the release of this lot normal shipments of acthar resumed 
we believe that the replacement of expired acthar at no cost and the decision to briefly limit shipment of acthar will have a negative impact on our first quarter product sales of acthar and although we expect total annual sales of acthar to increase as compared to  the increase year to year may be lower than we expected depending on the amount of additional replacements of expired product 
we are reviewing the amount of acthar at the wholesale level to help assess the demand for acthar in we expect that acthar will continue to constitute a significant portion of our revenues for although our goal is to actively promote acthar  and we have no reason to believe acthar will not be successful  we cannot predict whether the strong demand for acthar will continue in the future or that we will continue to generate significant revenues from sales of acthar 
if the demand for acthar declines  or if we are 
table of contents forced to reduce the price  or if exchange of product is higher than anticipated  or if we are forced to re negotiate contracts or terms  or if our customers do not comply with our existing policies  our revenues from the sale of acthar would decline 
if the cost to produce acthar increases  and we are unable to raise the price correspondingly  our gross margins on the sale of acthar would decline 
any delays or problems associated with the site transfer of the manufacturers of acthar will reduce the amount of the product that will be available for sale 
if our revenues from the sale of acthar decline  our total revenues  gross margins and operating results would be harmed and we may not have sufficient revenues to fund our operations 
in and  the acthar vials we sold had a one year shelf life 
due to the short dating  significant quantities could expire at the wholesaler or pharmacy level  which would then be returned for replacement product  under our exchange policy 
the shipment of replacement product displaces future sales 
our inability to secure additional funding could lead to a loss of your investment 
in order to conduct our operating activities  we may require substantial additional capital resources in order to acquire new products  increase sales of existing products  and maintain our operations 
in addition  if further capital investments do not materialize  or if such investments cannot be completed at attractive terms to us  or if we are unable to receive any additional capital investments at all  this may further limit our ability to fund operations 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the following existing product sales performance  cost maintenance and potential future expansion of our sales force  achieving better operating efficiencies  obtaining product from our sole source contract manufacturers and completing the site transfer to new contract manufacturers  and acquiring additional products 
we anticipate obtaining additional financing through public or private debt or equity financings 
however  additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all 
further  additional equity financings will be dilutive to our shareholders 
if sufficient capital is not available  then we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  eliminate or divest one or more of our products  product acquisition or manufacturing efforts 
if we are unable to contract with third party manufacturers  we may be unable to meet the demand for our products and lose potential revenues 
we will rely on third party contract manufacturers to produce our marketed products  acthar  ethamolin  glofil  inulin and vsl  and other products that we may develop  commercialize or acquire in the future 
third party manufacturers may not be able to meet our needs with respect to timing  cost  quantity or quality 
all of our manufacturers are sole source manufacturers and no currently qualified alternative suppliers exist 
under our agreement with aventis pharmaceuticals  inc aventis  aventis manufactured and supplied acthar through july aventis filled one final lot of acthar that is included in inventories at december  it is anticipated that the inventory of acthar on hand at year end  will be sufficient to meet expected demand through late we have identified a new contract manufacturer of acthar finished product and have begun to transfer the final fill and labeling process from aventis to this new manufacturer 
under our agreement with aventis  we are committed to purchase the api and other inventory residing at aventis 
we believe this api will be sufficient to meet our forecasted demand through this bulk product originally manufactured by aventis will be transferred to the new final fill manufacturer 
it is anticipated that this new contract manufacturer will complete the transfer and begin supplying to us finished product using the api manufactured by aventis during we have identified a potential new manufacturer for the api 
the process of manufacturing acthar is complex and problems associated with the site transfer may be encountered 
once the site transfer to the new final fill manufacturer and the new api 
table of contents manufacturer has been completed and they begin supplying acthar to us  the cost of the product is expected to increase 
ethamolin is currently being manufactured by ben venue laboratories ben venue 
we do not have a formal ethamolin manufacturing contract in place with ben venue  rather we have an agreement on terms and conditions and purchase product on a purchase order basis under these agreed upon terms and conditions 
we intend to order inventory on a purchase order basis until a contract is in place 
glofil is manufactured by iso tex diagnostics  inc on a purchase order basis 
the api for inulin is manufactured by pfanstiehl laboratories  inc under a contract we have with them  and the final fill product for inulin is manufactured by ben venue on a purchase order basis 
in  a ph decrease was observed during stability studies for inulin in sodium chloride drug product 
the actual ph was below the ph level set by the existing united states pharmacopeia the usp standards 
as a result  we were unable to ship inulin to our customers 
this issue has been addressed by obtaining fda and usp approval to lower the usp specification for inulin in sodium chloride to the response from both agencies indicates that all safety and efficacy issues have been satisfactorily addressed 
currently  we are working with our contract manufacturers to provide this drug product in we have been unable to procure additional supply of inulin from our contract manufacturer 
until a new supply of inulin is obtained  we will not be able to sell inulin 
vsl is supplied by vsl pharmaceuticals  inc under a promotion agreement we have with them 
vsl has the sole responsibility for manufacturing or acquiring the vsl product 
if we are unable to contract for a sufficient supply of our required products and substances on acceptable terms  or if we should encounter delays or difficulties in our relationships with our manufacturers  or if the site transfers and the corresponding approval by the fda and other regulatory authorities does not occur on a timely basis at the appropriate costs to us  we will lose sales 
moreover  contract manufacturers that we may use must continually adhere to current good manufacturing practices regulations enforced by the fda 
if the facilities of these manufacturers cannot pass an inspection  we may lose the fda approval of our products 
during december of  we experienced a short supply situation with ethamolin and acthar due to manufacturing constraints at two of our third party contract manufacturers 
the short supply situation has been resolved 
as of december  we were unable to supply inulin due to the failure of the product to meet certain specifications 
we cannot guarantee that we will not have supply interruptions in the future for ethamolin and acthar or any of our current or future products 
failure to obtain products for sale for any reason may result in an inability to meet product demand and a loss of potential revenues 
if we lose the services of certain key personnel or are unable to hire skilled personnel in the future  our business will be harmed 
we are highly dependent on the services of charles j 
casamento  chairman  president  and chief executive officer  timothy e 
morris  vice president of finance and administration and chief financial officer  and kenneth r 
greathouse  vice president of commercial operations 
if we were to lose either mr 
casamento  mr 
morris or mr 
greathouse as employees  our business could be harmed 
moreover  we do not carry key person life insurance for our senior management or other personnel 
additionally  the future potential growth and expansion of our business is expected to place increased demands on our management skills and resources 
although only minor increases in staffing levels are expected during  recruiting and retaining management and operational personnel to perform sales and marketing  business development  regulatory affairs  medical affairs and contract manufacturing in the future will also be critical to our success 
we do not know if we will be able to attract and retain skilled and experienced management and operational personnel in the future on acceptable terms given the intense competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  universities and other research institutions for such personnel 
if we are unable to hire necessary skilled personnel in the future  our business could be harmed 
our products in the development stage may not be accepted by the market  which may result in lower future revenues as well as a decline in our competitive positioning 
emitasol  an intranasal medication used to treat nausea and vomiting  is in the development stage 
emitasol could be developed for two indications a decreased movement of the stomach region in diabetics 
table of contents causing fullness  bloating and nausea  known as diabetic gastroparesis  and delayed onset emesis  the vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy patients occurring the day after and beyond the chemotherapy treatment 
the diabetic gastroparesis drug candidate was being developed in collaboration with a subsidiary of shire pharmaceutical group plc in the us and had completed a phase ii clinical trial in patients with diabetic gastroparesis 
with the expiration in july of the exclusive option to develop emitasol held by shire  development of emitasol under this collaboration stopped 
further development of emitasol is on hold pending our entering into an agreement with a future partner to fund the development of emitasol 
we also have intranasal drug candidates  panistat for the management of panic disorders  and hypnostat for the treatment of insomnia  which have now been licensed to fabre kramer 
there is no guarantee that any of these drugs will successfully complete the additional clinical testing needed to obtain fda approval 
clinical trial results are frequently susceptible to varying interpretations by scientists  medical personnel  regulatory personnel  statisticians and others  which may delay  limit or prevent further clinical development or regulatory approvals of a product candidate 
also  the length of time that it takes for our partners to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing can vary by product and by the indicated use of a product 
if one or more of these drugs fail to successfully pass phase iii testing  we would be unable to market or sell the product  which could result in lower future revenues as well as a decline in our competitive positioning 
additionally  our commercial products and any products that we successfully develop  if approved for marketing  may never achieve market acceptance 
these products  if successfully developed  will compete with drugs and therapies manufactured and marketed by major pharmaceutical and other biotechnology companies 
physicians  patients or the medical community in general may not accept and utilize the products that we may develop or that our corporate partners may develop 
the degree of market acceptance of any products that we develop will depend on a number of factors  including the establishment and demonstration of the clinical efficacy and safety of the product candidates  their potential advantage over alternative treatment methods and competing products  reimbursement policies of government and third party payors  and our ability to market and promote the products effectively 
the failure of our products to achieve market acceptance may result in lower future revenues as well as a decline in our competitive positioning 
a large percentage of our common stock is beneficially owned by one shareholder and its affiliates  who in the future could attempt to take over control of our management and operations or exercise voting power to advance their own best interests and not necessarily those of other shareholders 
sigma tau finanziaria spa and its affiliates sigma tau beneficially own  directly or indirectly  approximately of the voting power of our outstanding voting capital stock  and they beneficially own  including shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of a convertible debenture and exercise of warrants  approximately of our outstanding common stock  as of march  accordingly  these shareholders may control the outcome of certain shareholder votes  including votes concerning the election of directors  the adoption or amendment of provisions in our articles of incorporation  and the approval of mergers and other significant corporate transactions 
this level of concentrated ownership may  at a minimum  have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in the management or voting control of us by a third party 
it may also place us in the position of having our large shareholder take control of us and having new management inserted and new objectives adopted 
on january   sigma tau requested that we increase the size of our board of directors by two  with such directors to be nominated by sigma tau and elected by our board of directors as soon as possible 
sigma tau subsequently rescinded this request 
on march   sigma tau indicated that they have determined to sell all or a portion of the shares of our common stock that they currently own 
they further 
table of contents indicated that such sales  if they occur  will be through open market transactions or privately negotiated  and will depend on prevailing market conditions at time of sale 
such sales  if they occur  could have a depressing effect on the market price of our common stock 
if competitors develop and market products that are more effective than ours  our commercial opportunity will be reduced or eliminated 
the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change 
a number of companies are pursuing the development of pharmaceuticals and products which target the same diseases and conditions that we will target 
for example  there are products on the market that compete with acthar  ethamolin  glofil  inulin  and vsl moreover  technology controlled by third parties that may be advantageous to our business may be acquired or licensed by competitors of ours  preventing us from obtaining this technology on favorable terms  or at all 
our ability to compete will depend on our ability to create and maintain scientifically advanced technology  and to develop  acquire and commercialize pharmaceutical products based on this technology  as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel  obtain patent protection  or otherwise develop proprietary technology or processes  and secure sufficient capital resources for the expected substantial time period between technological conception and commercial sales of products based upon our technology 
acthar is currently used in patients suffering from arthritis  multiple sclerosis  and infantile spasm 
acthar may be challenged by newer agents  such as synthetic corticosteriods  immune system suppressants known as immunosuppressants  and anti seizure medications in the case of infantile spasms and other types of anti inflammatory products for various autoimmune conditions that have inflammation as a clinical aspect of the disease several companies may offer sclerotherapy agents chemicals injected into varicose veins that damage and scar the inside lining of the vein  causing it to close that compete with ethamolin 
other competitive agents include scleromate tm an injectable agent used to treat varicose veins and spider veins  rubber band ligation methods procedures in which bleeding esophageal varices are tied off at their base with rubber bands  cutting off the blood flow such as the multi band superview manufactured by boston scientific  the multi band six shooter manufactured by wilson cook  and the multi band ligator manufactured by bard 
other products may reduce the number of bleeding esophageal varices by lowering portal hypertension  such as sandostatin manufactured by novartis 
the competition to market fda approved active bleeding esophageal varices therapies is intense 
there are numerous products that may be viewed as competitors to glofil these include intrinsic tests  such as serum creatinine tests and creatinine clearance tests  both used to measure how quickly the kidneys are able to clear creatinine  an endogenously produced natural chemical  from the blood 
extrinsic tests use such products as tc dtpa  manufactured by mallinckrodt  inc  omnipaque an injectable contrast media agent  manufactured by sanofi  a division of sanofi synthelabo  and conray iothalamate meglumine another injectable contrast medium  manufactured by mallinckrodt  inc there is intense competition among both fda and non fda approved products to measure kidney function 
virtually any number of manufacturers of probiotics may be considered competitors to vsl among the most notable are culturelle tm by conagra and probiotica by johnson and johnson 
several large companies products will compete with emitasol in the delayed onset emesis market  including zofran a medication used to prevent and treat chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting by glaxo wellcome  kytril a medication used to prevent and treat chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting by smithkline beecham and reglan a medication used to prevent and treat chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting by ah robins 
these competitive products  however  are currently available in oral and intravenous delivery forms only 
additionally  on march   fda s gastrointestinal drugs advisory committee recommended that the fda approve merck s emend aprepitant with ht antagonist for various indications including delayed onset emesis 
the competition to develop fda approved drugs for delayed onset emesis and diabetic gastroparesis is intense 

table of contents many of the companies developing competing technologies and products have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in development  manufacturing  obtaining regulatory approvals  and marketing than we do 
other smaller companies may also prove to be significant competitors  particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies 
academic institutions  government agencies and other public and private research organizations may also seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for clinical development  manufacturing  and marketing of products similar to ours 
these companies and institutions will compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified sales and marketing and management personnel  as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to our programs 
we will face competition with respect to product efficacy and safety  the timing and scope of regulatory approvals  availability of resources  price  and patent position  including potentially dominant patent positions of others 
if our competitors succeed in developing technologies and drugs that are more effective or less costly than any that we are developing  our technology and future drugs may be rendered obsolete and noncompetitive 
in addition  our competitors may succeed in obtaining the approval of the fda or other regulatory approvals for drug candidates more rapidly than we will 
companies that complete clinical trials  obtain required regulatory agency approvals and commence commercial sale of their drugs before their competitors may achieve a significant competitive advantage  including patent and fda marketing exclusivity rights that would delay our ability to market specific products 
we do not know if drugs resulting from the joint efforts of our existing or future collaborative partner will be able to compete successfully with our competitors existing products or products under development or whether we will obtain regulatory approval in the us or elsewhere 
we face possible delisting from the american stock exchange that would result in a limited public market for our common stock 
we have fallen below certain of the american stock exchange s amex continued listing standards and have therefore become subject to possible delisting 
specifically  on august   we received notification from amex that we have fallen below the standards set forth in the amex guide section a i by having stockholders equity of less than  and losses from continuing operations in the last two fiscal years and stockholders equity of less than  and losses from continuing operations in the last three fiscal years 
the notification provided that we could submit a plan to amex by september  advising it of the measures we intended to take in order to bring us into compliance with amex s continuing listing standards 
we submitted such a plan of compliance to the amex on september  on october   the amex notified us that it had completed its review of our plan of compliance and determined that  in accordance with section of the amex company guide  the plan made a reasonable demonstration of our ability to regain compliance with the continued listing standards within eighteen months 
we will be subject to periodic review by the amex staff during the eighteen month extension period during which period we are required to make progress consistent with our plan and to ultimately comply with the continued listing standards 
if we are delisted from amex  the public market for our common stock would be limited 
in january we completed a million private placement of series b convertible preferred stock 
we believe that this placement may increase our net equity and increase our chances of regaining compliance with the amex listing requirements 
if we fail to maintain or enter into new contracts related to collaborations and in licensed or acquired technology and products  our product development and commercialization could be delayed 
our business model has been dependent on our ability to enter into licensing and acquisition arrangements with commercial or academic entities to obtain technology for commercialization or marketed products 
if we are unable to enter into any new agreements in the future  our development and commercialization 
table of contents efforts will be delayed 
disputes may arise regarding the inventorship and corresponding rights in inventions and know how resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by us and our licensors or scientific collaborators 
we may not be able to negotiate additional license and acquisition agreements in the future on acceptable terms  if at all 
in addition  current license and acquisition agreements may be terminated  and we may not be able to maintain the exclusivity of our exclusive licenses 
if collaborators do not commit sufficient development resources  technology  regulatory expertise  manufacturing  marketing and other resources towards developing  promoting and commercializing products incorporating our discoveries  the development of our licensed products progress will be stalled 
further  competitive conflicts may arise among these third parties that could prevent them from working cooperatively with us 
the amount and timing of resources devoted to these activities by the parties could depend on the achievement of milestones by us and otherwise generally may be controlled by other parties 
in addition  we expect that our agreements with future collaborators will likely permit the collaborators to terminate their agreements upon written notice to us 
this type of termination would substantially reduce the likelihood that the applicable research program or any lead candidate or candidates would be developed into a drug candidate  would obtain regulatory approvals and would be manufactured and successfully commercialized 
if none of our collaborations are successful in developing and commercializing products  or if we do not receive milestone payments or generate revenues from royalties sufficient to offset our significant investment in product development and other costs  then our business could be harmed 
disagreements with our collaborators could lead to delays or interruptions in  or termination of  development and commercialization of certain potential products or could require or result in litigation or arbitration  which could be time consuming and expensive and may result in lost revenues and substantial legal costs which could negatively impact our results from operations 
in addition  if we are unable to acquire new marketed products on a timely basis at appropriate purchase price and terms  we may not reach profitability and may not generate sufficient cash to fund operations 
if we are unable to settle the dispute surrounding our collaboration agreement with shire pharmaceuticals group plc  we may incur increased legal and or litigation expenses and lost revenues from delays in the commercialization of emitasol 
under a collaboration agreement between shire after its acquisition of roberts pharmaceuticals and us  shire had the option to acquire exclusive north american rights to emitasol 
this option expired in july under that collaboration agreement  we were obligated to fund one half of the clinical development expenses for emitasol up to an aggregate of million 
through december   we have made development payments for emitasol  under the terms of the agreement with shire  totaling million  which consists of million paid to shire and approximately  paid to other parties for allowable expenses  including patent and trademark costs 
shire asserts we owe  in development expenses incurred by it under the collaboration agreement prior to the expiration of the option 
we have requested that shire return certain items to us  including the manufacturing and clinical data it obtained over the course of the agreement  the transfer of the inds relating to emitasol which is substantially complete and the assignment of the intellectual property relating to emitasol generated in the course of the development program 
while shire has returned some of these items  we are still in discussion with them as to the resolution of other open items 
the failure to quickly resolve any open items on favorable terms relating to this collaboration could result in difficulties finding a new partner to continue the development of emitasol 
additionally  shire beneficially owns all  shares of our series a preferred stock outstanding  representing approximately of the voting power of our outstanding voting capital stock as of march  if we are unable to settle our disagreements with shire quickly  we may end up in a protracted contract dispute with this major shareholder  which may result in increased legal fees  delayed commercialization of emitasol and lost revenues from the sale of emitasol 

table of contents if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights  we may lose our competitive position and future revenues 
our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patents for our products and technologies  protect trade secrets  operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others  and prevent others from infringing on our proprietary rights 
we will only be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties to the extent that these rights are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets and are otherwise protectable under applicable law 
we will attempt to protect our proprietary position by filing us and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary products  technology  inventions and improvements that are important to the development of our business 
the patent positions of biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies involve complex legal and factual questions and  therefore  enforceability cannot be predicted with certainty 
patents  if issued  may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
thus  any patents that we own or license from third parties may not provide any protection against competitors 
pending patent applications we may file in the future  or those we may license from third parties  may not result in patents being issued 
also  patent rights may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology 
furthermore  others may independently develop similar technologies or duplicate any technology that we have developed or we will develop 
the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the us in addition to patents  we rely on trade secrets and proprietary know how 
we currently seek protection  in part  through confidentiality and proprietary information agreements 
these agreements may not provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies for proprietary technology in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential and proprietary information 
the parties may not comply or may breach these agreements 
furthermore  our trade secrets may otherwise become known to  or be independently developed by competitors 
our success will further depend  in part  on our ability to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others 
if our activities infringe on patents owned by others  we could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves in suits brought against a licensor or us 
should our products or technologies be found to infringe on patents issued to third parties  the manufacture  use and sale of our products could be enjoined  and we could be required to pay substantial damages 
in addition  we  in connection with the development and use of our products and technologies  may be required to obtain licenses to patents or other proprietary rights of third parties  which may not be made available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
since we must obtain regulatory approval to market our products in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions  we cannot predict whether or when we will be permitted to commercialize our products 
any products that we develop are subject to regulation by federal  state and local governmental authorities in the us  including the fda  and by similar agencies in other countries 
any product that we develop must receive all relevant regulatory approvals or clearances before it may be marketed in a particular country 
the regulatory process  which includes extensive pre clinical studies and clinical trials of each product to establish its safety and efficacy  is uncertain  can take many years and requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
data obtained from pre clinical and clinical activities are susceptible to varying interpretations which could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval or clearance 
in addition  delays or rejections may be encountered based upon changes in regulatory policy during the period of product 
table of contents development and the period of review of any application for regulatory approval or clearance for a product 
delays in obtaining regulatory approvals or clearances could stall the marketing  selling and distribution of any products that our corporate partners or we develop  impose significant additional costs on our corporate partners and us  diminish any competitive advantages that we or our corporate partners may attain  and decrease our ability to receive royalties and generate revenues and profits 
regulatory approval  if granted  may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which a new product may be marketed that could limit the potential market for the product 
product approvals  once granted  may be withdrawn if problems occur after initial marketing 
furthermore  manufacturers of approved products are subject to pervasive review  including compliance with detailed regulations governing fda good manufacturing practices 
the fda has recently revised the good manufacturing practices regulations 
failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in warning letters  fines  injunctions  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  refusal of the government to grant marketing applications and criminal prosecution 
in addition  we cannot predict the extent of government regulations or the impact of new governmental regulations that may result in the delay in the development  production and marketing of our products 
as such  we may be required to incur significant costs to comply with current or future laws or regulations 
for example  successful late stage phase iii clinical trials for such potentially important treatments such as diabetic gastroparesis and delayed onset emesis may require the enrollment of many patients 
together  the costs of these trials  if funded solely by us  could exceed our current financial resources 
our ability to generate revenues is affected by the availability of reimbursement on our products  and our ability to generate revenues will be diminished if we fail to obtain an adequate level of reimbursement for our products from third party payors 
in both domestic and foreign markets  sales of our products will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third party payors such as state and federal governments for example  under medicare and medicaid programs in the us and private insurance plans 
because of vsl s non prescription status  it is not widely covered by third party payors 
in certain foreign markets  the pricing and profitability of our products generally are subject to government controls 
in the us  there have been  and we expect there will continue to be  a number of state and federal proposals that limit the amount that state or federal governments will pay to reimburse the cost of drugs 
in addition  we believe the increasing emphasis on managed care in the us has and will continue to put pressure on the price and usage of our products  which may impact product sales 
further  when a new therapeutic is approved  the reimbursement status and rate of such a product is uncertain 
in addition  current reimbursement policies for existing products may change at any time 
changes in reimbursement or our failure to obtain reimbursement for our products may reduce the demand for  or the price of  our products  which could result in lower product sales or revenues  thereby weakening our competitive position and negatively impacting our results of operations 
in the us  proposals have called for substantial changes in the medicare and medicaid programs 
if such changes are enacted  they may require significant reductions from currently projected government expenditures for these programs 
driven by budget concerns  medicaid managed care systems have been implemented in several states and local metropolitan areas 
if the medicare and medicaid programs implement changes that restrict the access of a significant population of patients to its innovative medicines  the market acceptance of these products may be reduced 
to facilitate the availability of our products for medicaid patients  we have contracted with the center for medicare and medicaid services 
as a result  we pay quarterly rebates consistent with the utilization of our products by individual states 
we also must give discounts under contract on purchases or reimbursements of pharmaceutical products by certain other federal and state agencies and programs 
if these discounts and 
table of contents rebates become burdensome to us and we are not able to sell our products through these channels  our net sales could decline 
our stock price has a history of volatility  and an investment in our stock could decline in value 
the price of our stock  like that of other specialty pharmaceutical companies  is subject to significant volatility 
our stock price has ranged in value from to over the last three years 
any number of events  both internal and external to us  may continue to affect our stock price 
these include  without limitation  the quarterly and yearly revenues and earnings losses  our ability to acquire and market appropriate pharmaceuticals  results of clinical trials conducted by us  our partners or by our competitors  announcement by us or our competitors regarding product development efforts  including the status of regulatory approval applications  the outcome of legal proceedings  including claims filed by us against third parties to enforce our patents and claims filed by third parties against us relating to patents held by the third parties  the launch of competing products  the resolution of or failure to resolve disputes with collaboration partners and corporate restructuring by us 
if product liability lawsuits are successfully brought against us or we become subject to other forms of litigation  we may incur substantial liabilities and costs and may be required to limit commercialization of our products 
our business will expose us to potential liability risks that are inherent in the testing  manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical products 
the use of any drug candidates ultimately developed by us or our collaborators in clinical trials may expose us to product liability claims and possible adverse publicity 
these risks will expand for any of our drug candidates that receive regulatory approval for commercial sale and for those products we currently market 
product liability insurance for the pharmaceutical industry is generally expensive  if available at all 
we currently have product liability insurance for claims up to  however  if we are unable to maintain insurance coverage at acceptable costs  in a sufficient amount  or at all  or if we become subject to a product liability claim  our reputation  stock price and ability to devote the necessary resources to the commercialization of our products could be negatively impacted

factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in this section  as well as item business of questcor  including without limitation risk factors  as well as those discussed in any documents incorporated by reference herein or therein 
we are a specialty pharmaceutical company that markets and sells brand name prescription drugs and ethically promoted healthcare products 
we focus on the treatment of acute and critical care conditions  including central nervous system diseases and gastroenterological disorders 
our strategy is to acquire pharmaceutical products that other companies do not actively market that we believe have sales growth potential  are promotion sensitive and complement our existing products 
in addition  through corporate collaborations  we intend to develop new patented intranasal formulations of previously fda approved drugs 
we currently market five products in the us hp acthar gel acthar  an injectable drug that is commonly used in treating patients with infantile spasm  and is approved for the treatment of certain cns disorders with an inflammatory component including the treatment of flares associated with multiple sclerosis  ethamolin  an injectable drug used to treat enlarged weakened blood vessels at the entrance to the stomach that have recently bled  known as esophageal varices  glofil and inulin in sodium chloride  which are both injectable agents that assess how well the kidney is working by measuring glomerular filtration rate  or kidney function  and vsl tm  a patented probiotic marketed as a dietary supplement  to promote normal gastrointestinal gi function 
probiotics are living organisms in food and dietary supplements  which  upon ingestion in certain numbers  improve the health of the host beyond their inherent basic nutrition 
consistent with our efforts to focus on sales and marketing  our spending on research and development activities is minimal 
expenses incurred for the manufacturing site transfer  medical and regulatory affairs are included on the statement of operations as research and development expenses 
accordingly  we have entered 
table of contents into several agreements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to further the development of certain technology acquired from ribogene 
in june  we signed a definitive license agreement with fabre kramer pharmaceuticals  inc for the exclusive worldwide development and commercialization of hypnostat tm intranasal triazolam for insomnia and panistat tm intranasal alprazolam for panic disorders 
under the license agreement  fabre kramer assumed the primary responsibility for the development of hypnostat and panistat 
the antifungal drug discovery program has been partnered with tularik  inc  of south san francisco  ca  the antiviral drug discovery program has been partnered with rigel pharmaceuticals  inc of south san francisco  ca 
and the antibacterial program has been partnered with dainippon pharmaceuticals co  ltd 
of osaka  japan 
we have sustained an accumulated deficit of million from inception through december  at december   we had million in cash and short term investments 
results of operations may vary significantly from quarter to quarter depending on  among other factors  the results of our sales efforts  timing of expiration of our products and the resulting shipment of replacement product under our exchange policy  the availability of finished goods from our sole source manufacturers  the timing of certain expenses  the acquisition of marketed products  the establishment of strategic alliances and corporate partnering and the receipt of milestone payments 
critical accounting policies our management discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to product returns  sales allowances  bad debts  inventories  investments and intangible assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
sales allowances and product returns and rebates we have estimated allowances for product returns  chargebacks  rebates and cash discounts for prompt payment 
we estimate our allowances by utilizing historical information for existing products 
for new products  we estimate our allowances for product returns and rebates on specific terms for product returns and rebates and our experience with similar products 
effective august   we changed our return goods policy such that we no longer issue credit memorandums for returns  rather all returns are exchanged for replacement product 
the estimated costs for such exchanges  which include actual product costs and related shipping charges are included in cost of product sales 
in estimating returns  we analyze i historical returns and sales patterns  ii current inventory on hand at wholesalers and in the distribution channel and the remaining shelf life of that inventory ranging from days to years  and iii changes in demand 
we continually assess the historical experience and adjust our allowances as appropriate 
in estimating rebates  we match the actual rebates to the actual sale on a product by product basis  to arrive at an actual rebate percentage 
this actual percentage is applied to current period sales to arrive at the rebate expense for the period 
in particular  we consider allowable prices by medicare and medicaid 
if actual product returns  chargebacks  rebates and cash discounts are greater than our estimates  additional allowances may be required 
inventories we maintain inventory reserves primarily for obsolescence due to the expiration of shelf life 
in estimating inventory obsolescence reserves  we analyze on a product by product basis i the shelf life and the 
table of contents expiration date  and ii sales forecasts 
judgment is required in determining whether the forecasted sales information is sufficiently reliable to enable us to estimate inventory obsolescence 
intangible assets we have intangible assets related to goodwill and other acquired intangibles 
the determination of related estimated useful lives and whether or not these assets are impaired involves significant judgment 
changes in strategy and or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded asset balances 
we review intangible assets  as well as other long lived assets  for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable 
results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  for the year ended december   we incurred a net loss of  or per share  as compared to a net loss of  or per share for the year ended december   a decrease of  or 
for the year ended december   net product sales increased by  or to  from  for the year ended december  the increase in product revenues was due primarily to increased units sales of ethamolin and a full year of sales of acthar  which was introduced in the third quarter of the increase of unit sales over the prior year was partially due to a shipment of backorders of acthar and ethamolin in early and strategic buying by wholesalers in anticipation of our price increase in june during the year ended december  we shipped backorders outstanding at december  amounting to  for acthar and  for ethamolin 
without these backorders  product revenues would have been  an increase of  or over the year ended december  effective june   we increased our list price for ethamolin and acthar 
from the date of the notification of the price increase through june   we received  of acthar and ethamolin orders of which  had shipped prior to june  the remaining orders of  were fulfilled in july effective august  we changed our return goods policy such that we no longer issue credit memorandums for returns  rather all returns are exchanged for replacement product  and estimated costs for such exchanges  which include actual product material costs and related shipping charges  are included in cost of product sales 
in november  a lot of acthar expired 
the next batch of acthar will expire in may in december  we noted that certain customers were not complying with our exchange policy 
these customers were deducting from amounts owed to us the full price of expired acthar they planned to return to us 
we reached an agreement with these customers to reverse these short remittances and to accept replacement product 
certain customers received a one time replacement rebate from us 
in addition  during we will replace vials at no cost for the remaining on hand inventories of acthar batches that expired in november and will do so again for the acthar that expires in may in the first quarter of  due to the relatively short dating of acthar in our inventories and at the wholesale level  we limited acthar shipments to critical care and emergency situations 
a lot of acthar with the new month dating was released in the first quarter of with the release of this lot normal shipments resumed 
we believe that the replacement of expired acthar at no cost and the decision to briefly limit shipments of acthar will have a negative impact on our first quarter of product sales of acthar and although we expect total annual sales of acthar to increase as compared to  the increase year to year may be lower than we expected depending on the amount of additional replacements of expired product 
we are reviewing the amount of inventory at the wholesale level in order to help assess the demand for acthar in in addition  due to the large purchase of ethamolin by wholesalers in anticipation of the price increase in july  we expect ethamolin sales in the first quarter of to be lower than expected 
in and  our acthar vials sold had a one year shelf life 
due to the short dating  significant quantities could expire at the wholesaler or pharmacy level  which would then be returned for replacement product  under our exchange policy 
the shipment of replacement product displaces future sales 
quarterly revenues will fluctuate based on buying patterns of the wholesalers  expiration dates of product sold and timing of shipment of replacement product under our exchange policy 

table of contents contract research and grant revenue decreased by  or to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily the result of us receiving less reimbursement under our sbir grant due to a decrease in activity with our geri compound research project during the year ended december  this grant is scheduled to end in april and we do not believe we will receive any more than the remaining  in reimbursement under this grant in for the year ended december   we recognized  in technology revenue related to our license agreements with fabre kramer and ahn gook 
for the year ended december   we recognized  in technology revenue related to a payment under our license agreement with tularik  inc for the sale of our antifungal drug discovery program 
royalty revenue for the year ended december  was  a slight increase as compared to  for the year ended december  royalty revenue represents sales of pramidin in italy  under our license agreement with sirton
