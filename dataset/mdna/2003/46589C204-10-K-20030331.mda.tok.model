we develop  manufacture and market products that provide information to doctors performing minimally invasive general surgical  cardiac surgical and other selected microsurgical procedures 
our products combine a head mounted display with video cameras to provide surgeons with critical visual information during these microsurgical procedures  combined with the ability to view new additional information in a voice controlled  picture in picture format  to facilitate real time decision making during surgery 
our product line include the endosite advanced visualization and information system for general surgery and other complex endoscopic procedures 
in general terms  endoscopic surgery involves a telescopic viewing device which is inserted into a small incision in the body and which allows the surgeon an adequate view of the internal part of the body being repaired

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   our investment portfolio included fixed income securities of million 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
due to the short term nature of our investment portfolio  an immediate percent increase in interest rates would have no material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
we have a  credit facility with a financial institution 
interest on this facility was prime plus at december  at december   we had no advances outstanding under this credit facility 
if we were to draw under this facility  changes in interest rates would affect the interest expense we would pay and could impact our cash flows and results of operations 
we generally conduct business  including sales to foreign customers  in us dollars and as a result have limited foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the effect of an immediate percent change in foreign exchange rates would not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations
