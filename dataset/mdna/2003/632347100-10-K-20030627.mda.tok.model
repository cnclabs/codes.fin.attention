item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction as used in this report  the terms we  us  our and nathan s mean nathan s famous  inc and its subsidiaries unless the context indicates a different meaning 
during the fiscal year ended march   we completed two acquisitions that provided us with two highly recognized brands 
on april   we became the franchisor of the kenny rogers roasters restaurant system by acquiring the intellectual property rights  including trademarks  recipes and franchise agreements of roasters corp 
and roasters franchise corp 
on september   we acquired the remaining of the outstanding common stock of miami subs corporation we did not already own 
our revenues are generated primarily from operating company owned restaurants and franchising the nathan s  miami subs and kenny rogers restaurant concepts  licensing agreements for the sale of nathan s products within supermarkets and selling products under nathan s branded product program 
the branded product program enables foodservice operators to offer nathans hot dogs and other proprietary items for sale within their facilities 
in conjunction with this program  foodservice operators are granted a limited use of the nathans trademark with respect to the sale of hot dogs and certain other proprietary food items and paper goods 
in addition to plans for expansion through franchising and our branded product program  nathan s is continuing to capitalize on the co branding opportunities within our existing restaurant system 
currently  the arthur treacher s brand is being sold within nathan s  kenny rogers roasters and miami subs restaurants  the nathan s brand is included on the menu of miami subs and kenny rogers restaurants  while the kenny rogers roasters brand is being sold within miami subs and nathan s restaurants 
in connection with our acquisition of miami subs  we determined that up to underperforming restaurants would be closed pursuant to our divestiture plan 
to date  we have terminated leases on of those properties  sold one of the properties to a non franchisee and are continuing to market the remaining property for sale 
we also terminated additional leases for properties outside of the divestiture plan and may terminate additional leases in the future that were not part of our divestiture plan 
at march   our combined system consisted of franchised or licensed units  company owned units and over  nathan s branded product points of sale that feature nathan s world famous all beef hot dogs  located in states  the district of columbia and foreign countries 
at march   our company owned restaurant system included eight nathan s units and four miami subs units  as compared to nathan s units  four miami subs units and two kenny rogers roasters units at march  critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements and the notes to our consolidated financial statements contain information that is pertinent to management s discussion and analysis 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve additional management judgement due to the sensitivity of the methods  assumptions and estimates necessary in determining the related asset and liability amounts 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas no 
requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be reviewed annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise for impairment 
the most significant assumptions which are used in this test are estimates of future cash flows 
we typically use the same assumptions for this test as we use in the development of our business plans 
if these assumptions differ significantly from actual results  additional impairment expenses may be required 
in the first quarter of fiscal  nathan s adopted sfas no 
in connection with the implementation of this new standard  goodwill  trademarks  trade names and recipes were deemed to be impaired and their carrying value was written down by  or  net of income tax benefit of  impairment of long lived assets statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  sfas no 
requires management judgements regarding the future operating and disposition plans for underperforming assets  and estimates of expected realizable values for assets to be sold 
the application of sfas no 
has affected the amounts and timing of charges to operating results in recent years 
we evaluate possible impairment of each restaurant individually  and record an impairment charge whenever we determine that impairment factors exist 
we consider a history of restaurant operating losses to be the primary indicator of potential impairment of a restaurant s carrying value 
we have identified certain restaurants that have been impaired and recorded impairment charges of approximately  relating to seven restaurants during the fifty two weeks ended march  impairment of notes receivable statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  requires management judgements regarding the future collectibility of notes receivable and the underlying fair market value of collateral 
we consider the following factors when evaluating a note for impairment a indications that the borrower is experiencing business problems such as operating losses  marginal working capital  inadequate cash flow or business interruptions  b whether the loan is secured by collateral that is not readily marketable  or c whether the collateral is susceptible to deterioration in realizable value 
when determining possible impairment  we also assess our future intention to extend certain leases beyond the minimum lease term and the debtor s ability to meet its obligation over that extended term 
we have identified certain notes receivable that have been impaired and recorded impairment charges of approximately  relating to nine notes during the fifty two weeks ended march  revenue recognition in the normal course of business  we extend credit to franchisees for the payment of ongoing royalties and to trade customers of our branded product program 
notes and accounts receivable  net  as shown on our consolidated balance sheets are net of allowances for doubtful accounts 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is determined through analysis of the aging of accounts receivable at the date of the financial statements  assessment of collectibility based upon historical trends and an evaluation of the impact of current and projected economic conditions 
in the event that the collectibility of a receivable is doubtful  the associated revenue is not recorded until the facts and circumstances change in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
self insurance liabilities we are self insured for portions of our general liability coverage 
as part of our risk management strategy  our insurance programs include deductibles for each incident and in the aggregate for a policy year 
as such  we accrue estimates of our ultimate self insurance costs throughout the policy year 
these estimates have been developed based upon our historical trends  however  the final cost of many of these claims may not be known for five years or longer 
accordingly  our annual self insurance costs may be subject to adjustment from previous estimates as facts and circumstances change 
in conjunction with our external risk manager  we have completed an evaluation of the outstanding claims and reserves relating to prior years and have reversed  of previously recorded self insurance accruals during the fiscal year ended march  for those claims on which the company s exposure has been settled

benefit provision for income taxes from continuing operations in the fiscal period  the income tax benefit from continuing operations was  or of loss from continuing operations before income taxes as compared to a provision for income taxes of  or of income from continuing operations before income taxes in the fiscal period 
the effective income tax rate was lower in the fiscal period due in part to the adoption of sfas no 
which requires that goodwill no longer be amortized 
such goodwill amortization was not tax deductible by nathan s which increased the effective tax rate in prior years

revenues generated by these eight restaurants were  during the fiscal period as compared to  during the fiscal period

fiscal was a week reporting period while fiscal was a week reporting period 
approximately  in restaurant sales were generated during the additional week of operations 
the unit reduction was the result of our franchising two company owned restaurants  transferring one company owned restaurant to a franchisee pursuant to a management agreement  closing four unprofitable company owned units including three miami subs restaurants pursuant to our divesture plan  selling one unit pursuant to an order of condemnation and closing one unit due to its lease expiration 
the financial impact associated with these nine restaurants lowered restaurant sales by  and improved restaurant operating profits by  versus the fiscal period  excluding any one time gains or royalties to be received from restaurants sold to franchisees

at march   franchised or licensed restaurants were operating as compared to franchised or licensed restaurants at march  franchise fee income derived from new openings and co branding was  in the fiscal period as compared to  in the fiscal period

additionally  lower cost of sales at one of the kenny rogers roasters restaurants opened last year partly offset the higher costs at our comparable restaurants 
notwithstanding the lower costs and expenses of the kenny rogers roasters restaurant  this restaurant continued to underperform 
consequently  we decided to sell the kenny rogers roasters restaurant in rockville centre  new york in fiscal the cost of restaurant sales at our comparable units as a percentage of restaurant sales was in the fiscal period as compared to in the fiscal period due primarily to higher labor and related costs 
higher costs of approximately  were incurred in connection with the growth of our branded product program and higher product costs incurred for much of the fiscal period 
during the first twenty six weeks of fiscal  commodity prices of our primary meat products were at their highest levels in recent years causing the majority of the cost increase

there is no set time limit on the purchases 
nathan s expects to fund these stock repurchases from its operating cash flow 
we expect that we will make additional investments in certain existing restaurants in the future and that we expect to fund those investments from our operating cash flow 
we do not expect to incur significant capital expenditures to develop new company owned restaurants through march  in connection with our acquisition of miami subs  we determined that up to underperforming restaurants would be closed pursuant to our divestiture plan 
to date  we have terminated leases on of those properties  sold one of the remaining properties to a non franchisee and are continuing to market the remaining property for sale 
the sale of the restaurant was consummated on october  since acquiring miami subs  we have accrued approximately  and made payments of approximately  for lease obligations and termination costs  as part of the acquisition  for units having total future minimum lease obligations of  that had remaining lease terms of one year up to approximately years 
we may incur future cash payments  consisting primarily of future lease payments  including costs and expenses associated with terminating additional leases  that were not part of our divestiture plan 
there are currently properties that we either own or lease from third parties which we lease or sublease to franchisees and non franchisees 
we remain contingently liable for all costs associated with these properties including rent  property taxes and insurance 
additionally  we guaranteed financing on behalf of certain franchisees with two third party lenders 
our maximum obligation for loans funded by the lenders as of march  was approximately  the following schedules represent nathan s cash contractual obligations and the expiration of other contractual commitments by maturity in thousands payments due by period less than cash contractual obligations total year years years after years long term debt  capital lease obligations employment agreements  operating leases      gross cash contractual obligations      sublease income      net cash contractual obligations      amount of commitment expiration per period total amounts less than other contractual commitments committed year years years after years loan guarantees  total commercial commitments  management believes that available cash  marketable investment securities  and internally generated funds should provide sufficient capital to finance our operations for at least the next twelve months 
we maintain a  uncommitted bank line of credit and have never borrowed any funds under this line of credit 
seasonality our business is affected by seasonal fluctuations  the effects of weather and economic conditions 
historically  sales and earnings have been highest during our first two fiscal quarters with the fourth fiscal quarter representing the slowest period 
this seasonality is primarily attributable to weather conditions in our marketplace for our company owned nathan s stores  which is principally the new york metropolitan area 
miami subs restaurant sales have historically been strongest during the period march through august  which approximates our first and second quarters  as a result of a heavy concentration of restaurants being located in florida 
however  due to the changing composition of our restaurants  we believe that future revenues will be highest during our first two fiscal quarters with the fourth fiscal quarter representing the slowest period 
impact of inflation during the past several years  our commodity costs have remained relatively stable 
as such  we believe that inflation has not materially impacted earnings during that period of time 
however  during the first half of the fiscal period  commodity prices of our primary meat products were at their highest levels in recent years 
these costs were in line with historical norms during the fiscal period 
we also experienced increased costs for utilities and insurance during the fiscal and periods 
last year  various federal and new york state legislators proposed changes to the minimum wage requirements  however  none of the proposals were enacted 
we believe that increases in the minimum wage could have a significant financial impact on our financial results 
prolonged increases in labor  food and other operating expenses could adversely affect our operations and those of the restaurant industry and we might have to reconsider our pricing strategy as a means to offset reduced operating margins

these risks and uncertainties  many of which are not within our control  include  but are not limited to economic  weather  legislative and business conditions  the collectibility of receivables  the availability of suitable restaurant sites on reasonable rental terms  changes in consumer tastes  the ability to continue to attract franchisees  the ability to purchase our primary food and paper products at reasonable prices  no material increases in the minimum wage  and our ability to attract competent restaurant and managerial personnel 
we generally identify forward looking statements with the words believe  intend  plan  expect  anticipate  estimate  will  should and similar expressions

qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk cash and cash equivalents we have historically invested our cash and cash equivalents in short term  fixed rate  highly rated and highly liquid instruments which are reinvested when they mature throughout the year 
although our existing investments are not considered at risk with respect to changes in interest rates or markets for these instruments  our rate of return on short term investments could be affected at the time of reinvestment as a result of intervening events 
as of march   nathans cash and cash equivalents aggregated  earnings on these cash and cash equivalents would increase or decrease by approximately  per annum for each 
change in interest rates 
marketable investment securities we have invested our marketable investment securities in intermediate term  fixed rate  highly rated and highly liquid instruments 
these investments are subject to fluctuations in interest rates 
as of march   the market value of nathans marketable investment securities aggregated  interest income on these marketable investment securities would increase or decrease by approximately  per annum for each 
change in interest rates 
the following chart presents the hypothetical changes in the fair value of the marketable investments securities held at march  that are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations in thousands valuation of securities valuation of securities given an interest rate given an interest rate decrease of x basis points increase of x basis points fair bps bps bps value bps bps bps municipal notes and bonds        investment in limited partnership we had invested in a highly liquid investment limited partnership that invested principally in equity securities 
these investments were subject to the performance of the equity markets 
during fiscal  nathan s liquidated its investment in limited partnership 
accordingly  nathan s investment in limited partnership has no further exposure to the equity markets 
borrowings the interest rate on our borrowings are generally determined based upon prime rate and may be subject to market fluctuation as the prime rate changes as determined within each specific agreement 
we do not anticipate entering into interest rate swaps or other financial instruments to hedge our borrowings 
at march   total outstanding debt  including capital leases  aggregated  of which  is at risk due to changes in interest rates 
the current interest rate is per annum and will adjust in january and to prime plus 
nathan s also maintains a  credit line which bears interest at the prime rate at march  
the company has never borrowed any funds under this line 
accordingly  the company does not believe that fluctuations in interest rates would have a material impact on its financial results 
commodity costs the cost of commodities are subject to market fluctuation 
we have not attempted to hedge against fluctuations in the prices of the commodities we purchase using future  forward  option or other instruments 
as a result  our future commodities purchases are subject to changes in the prices of such commodities 
generally  we attempt to pass through permanent increases in our commodity prices to our customers  thereby reducing the impact of long term increases on our financial results 
a short term increase or decrease of in the cost of our food and paper products for the entire fifty two weeks ended march  would have increased or decreased cost of sales by approximately foreign currencies foreign franchisees generally conduct business with us and make payments in united states dollars  reducing the risks inherent with changes in the values of foreign currencies 
as a result  we have not purchased future contracts  options or other instruments to hedge against changes in values of foreign currencies and we do not believe fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies would have a material impact on our financial results
