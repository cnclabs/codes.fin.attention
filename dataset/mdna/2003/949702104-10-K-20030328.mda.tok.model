dividends paid were per share in     and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are principally engaged in the manufacture and marketing of permaclear and ecoclear brand pet resins and high quality polyester products  including fortrel brand polyester fibers 
we believe we are the world s largest pet plastics recycler  utilizing a significant amount of recycled raw materials in our manufacturing operations 
at december   we had annual operating capacity to manufacture approximately billion pounds of pet resins and billion pounds of polyester staple fiber at five major production facilities in the united states and europe 
see item business recent developments for information concerning businesses discontinued in the first quarter of  and see outlook below for information on our ability to convert certain fiber capacity to pet packaging resins 
our operations are classified into two reportable operating segments the packaging products group or ppg and the fibers and recycled products group or frpg 
our permaclear pet and hp resins are produced by the ppg from purified terephtalic acid pta and monoethylene glycol meg and ecoclear pet resins are produced from a combination of chemical and post consumer recycled raw materials 
these resins are primarily used in the manufacture of plastic soft drink bottles and other food and beverage packaging 
the frpg produces fortrel fibers  which are primarily used in apparel  non wovens  home products  and industrial products 
these fibers are also produced from pta and meg 
in addition  fortrel polyester and nylon for use primarily in furniture  pillows  comforters  industrial products  carpets and rugs  are manufactured from recycled pet raw materials  including post consumer containers and post industrial m aterials 
demand for both north american and global pet resins continues to grow  driven by new product applications for pet and conversions from other packaging materials to pet 
demand for polyester fibers historically has been cyclical 
it is subject to changes in consumer preferences and spending  retail sales patterns  and fiber and textile product imports 
imports of products throughout the textile chain continue to impact the united states fiber markets  adversely affecting our profitability 
our profitability is primarily determined by our raw material margins  which is the difference between product selling prices and raw material costs 
both pet resin and fiber raw material margins increase or decrease as a result of supply and demand factors and competitive conditions 
given our substantial unit volumes  the impact on profitability of changes in raw material margins is significant 
a 
change in raw material margin on approximately billion pounds of resin and fiber volume results in an annual change of approximately million in pretax income 
see outlook below for information on raw material prices in selling prices and raw material costs each may be affected by actions of our competitors  global economic and market conditions  export and import activity  and the prices of competing materials 
seasonal factors  such as weather and the vacation and holiday closings of our facilities or those of our customers  may also affect our operations 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
estimates are based on historical experience  information received from third parties and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  involve significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the critical accounting policies have been reviewed with our audit committee of the board of directors 
accounts receivable we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and generally do not require collateral 
we have established a reserve for uncollectible accounts receivable based on our evaluation of the credit worthiness of our customers and the potential risks inherent in their businesses 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the ultimate realization of these receivables  especially in light of the difficult economic conditions facing our customers 
these judgments could vary significantly from actual amounts realized  resulting in changes in bad debt expense and allowances 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we increased our reserve for uncollectible accounts by million in the fourth quarter of inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is principally determined by the first in  first out method 
the physical condition ie  quality of the inventories is also considered in establishing its valuation 
these judgments are estimates  which could vary significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from actual requirements for various reasons  including changes in future economic conditions  customer inventory levels  or competitive conditions that differ from our expectations 
changes in our inventory valuation resulting from such variances would affect our cost of sales 
property  plant and equipment property  plant and equipment are carried at cost 
depreciation for assets is provided based on their estimated useful lives and is computed on the straight line method and the units of production method 
changes in circumstances such as technological advances  changes to our capital strategy  or changes to our business model could result in the actual lives differing from our estimates  in which case our earnings could be affected 
effective january   we were required to adopt sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
sfas established criteria to determine when a long lived asset is held for sale and whether the results of operations of a component of an entity that either has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale should be reported in discontinued operations 
in accordance with sfas no 
 when an asset is held for sale  it is measured at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less costs of disposal 
the fair value of an asset is the amount at which that asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties 
judgment is required in determining the fair value of the assets and could differ from the actual amount received upon disposal 
goodwill and other intangibles through december   we amortized goodwill on a straight line method over periods ranging from to years 
effective january   we were required to adopt sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
based on this standard  goodwill is no longer amortized  but is tested at least annually at the reporting unit level for impairment 
goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value  including goodwill 
the fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated future discounted cash flows 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  no impairment loss is recognized 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  the goodwill of the reporting unit is potentially impaired 
a comparison is then made between the implied fair value of the goodwill  as defined by sfas no 
 and the carrying value of the goodwill 
if the implied fair value is less  an impairment loss equal to the difference is recognized 
this implied fair value then becomes the new carrying value of the goodwill for future impairment tests 
the estimate of future discounted cash flows is based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about future operating performance 
our estimates of future discounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  changes in economic conditions  our business model  or our operating performance 
deferred tax assets we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize the recorded value of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 
pension benefits our pension benefit costs and liabilities are calculated utilizing various actuarial assumptions and methodologies prescribed under sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions 
we utilize certain assumptions  including  but not limited to  the selection of the discount rate  the expected rate of return on plan assets  projected salary increases  and mortality rates 
the actuarial assumptions used in our pension reporting are reviewed annually and compared to external benchmarks to assure our pension obligations are fairly stated 
changes in assumptions and future investment returns could affect our pension expense and related funding requirements 
environmental liability our operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations governing air emissions  wastewater discharges  and solid and hazardous waste management activities 
our policy is to expense environmental remediation costs when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
the accruals represent our best estimate of probable non capital environmental expenditures 
the final resolution of these contingencies could result in expenses different than current accruals  and therefore have an impact on our consolidated financial results in a future reporting period 
impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
or fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a parent company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
a variable interest entity is a corporation  partnership  trust or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights or b has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
these variable interest entities are commonly referred to as special purpose entities or off balance sheet financings 
a variable interest entity often holds financial assets  including loans or receivables  real estate or other property 
a variable interest entity may be essentially pass ive or it may engage in research and development or other activities on behalf of another company 
the consolidation requirements of fin apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  the consolidation requirements of fin apply to older entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  certain of the disclosure requirements apply to all financial statements issued after january   regardless of when the variable interest entity was established 
the only contractual obligation that may be impacted by fin is a sale and leaseback transaction we entered into in we expect to restructure the sale and leaseback transaction prior to july  if we are successful  the sale and leaseback transaction will not be impacted by fin otherwise  we will consolidate the transaction and either record the impact as a cumulative effect of an accounting change or restate the prior years financial information 
other than normal financial risks  we do not have any exposure to risks as a result of this transaction 
we do not expect the adoption of fin to affect our compliance with debt covenants 
see table ii below and note to the consolidated financial statements 
discontinued operations in january  we announced plans to refocus the strategy of our polyester fibers business in order to be less dependent on commodity fibers 
we plan to direct our production capacity toward more differentiated  higher value added products  taking advantage of our unique production capabilities of polymer and extrusion fiber manufacturing and our chemical and recycled based raw material sources 
we believe that this new strategy will enable us to face the competitive challenges presented by the imports of textile and apparel fiber and finished goods that continue to adversely affect the domestic fibers market  particularly the domestic commodity textile market 
as a result of our review of strategic alternatives  in march we decided to sell our poy business and our small recycled fine denier polyester staple fiber business with manufacturing facilities located in fayetteville  north carolina and marion  south carolina  respectively 
these businesses are reported as discontinued operations i n our financial statements 
on june   we sold the property  plant and equipment and inventory of our poy business 
the aggregate sales price was million in cash including the reimbursement of certain business expenses and the assumption of certain liabilities 
the total loss on disposal of the assets of our poy business for the year ended december  was million  net of taxes 
the net loss is included in discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations 
the assets of our small recycled fine denier polyester staple fiber business are reported separately in our consolidated balance sheet at december  and we recorded an impairment charge of million  net of taxes  in the first quarter of to reflect the assets at their fair value less costs of disposal 
we expect to sell these assets by the end of the first quarter of the net operating results for the poy and recycled fine denier polyester staple fiber businesses for the year ending december  have been reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations 
in addition  information for all prior years presented has been reclassified in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
to reflect separately the assets of the discontinued operations and the loss from discontinued operations 
idle assets we completed the construction of our pearl river facility in this facility consists of two resin lines and one staple fiber line 
in december  we idled the staple fiber line because of the expected over supply of polyester stable fiber in the united states in since this line is depreciated using the units of production depreciation method  no depreciation expense has been charged with respect to this line since december it has a net book value of approximately million at december  in june  wellman announced plans to modify the polyester fiber line to enable it to produce either solid stated pet resin or polyester fiber 
this will allow us to take advantage of the expected growth in the pet resins industry  while maintaining our ability to respond to future fiber needs 
in december  we announced plans to delay the modification originally scheduled to begin in the first quarter until we are able to improve the project s economic return 
for addit ional information on idle assets  see note to the consolidated financial statements

plant costs were higher in the aggregate as a result of higher production levels  but were lower on a unit cost basis 
during  our operations were negatively impacted by a production outage that increased our costs by approximately million  or per diluted share  and lowered our volumes

for additional information  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
excluding the amortization expense for goodwill from the prior year  selling  general and administrative expenses increased in by million 
the increase in was due primarily to bad debt expense of approximately million for unexpected losses on accounts receivable  costs associated with new strategic initiatives of million  and higher professional fees of million due to the on going department of justice investigation of the staple fiber industry 
we increased our reserve for uncollecti ble accounts receivable by million in the fourth quarter of the increase in our reserve was  in part  necessary due to our textile customer base  which faces competitive challenges presented by the imports of textile and apparel finished goods that continue to adversely affect their profitability 
other income for consisted of proceeds of million received under the continued dumping and subsidy offset act of for additional information  see item recent developments continued dumping and subsidy offset act of as a result of the foregoing  we reported operating income of million in compared to million in net interest expense was million in compared to million in the decrease was due to a lower average debt balance and lower average interest rates during our effective tax rate for on income from continuing operations was compared to in the principal item affecting our rate was foreign earnings  which are taxed at rates lower than us rates 
the amount of foreign earnings declined in compared to  however  this was offset by the elimination of the amortization of non deductible goodwill 
as a result of the foregoing  net earnings from continuing operations were million  or per diluted share  for the period compared to million  or per diluted share  for we reported a net loss from discontinued operations of million  or per diluted share  and million  or per diluted share  for and  respectively 
we adopted a plan in march to sell our poy business and our small recycled fine denier polyester staple fiber business  the assets of which were previously reported as part of our frpg 
on june  we sold our poy business and reported a loss on disposal 
for additional information  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discontinued operations and note to the consolidated financial statements 
as required by sfas no 
 we completed our initial assessment of goodwill using the two step approach described in the statement and determined that the goodwill related to our frpg segment was impaired 
as a result  the carrying value of this goodwill was reduced by million to its implied value 
the reduction was recorded as a cumulative effect of accounting change in our first quarter financial statements 
for additional information  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
as a result of the foregoing  we reported a net loss of million  or per diluted share  for  compared to net earnings of million  or per diluted share  for compared to total net sales from continuing operations for decreased million  or  to  million from  million in due to the following ppg frpg total sales volumes net selling prices foreign currency translation total costs of sales from continuing operations for increased million  or  to million from million due to the following ppg frpg total raw material costs plant added costs foreign currency translation during  our operations were negatively impacted by a production outage that increased our costs by approximately million  or per diluted share  and lowered our sales volumes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
as a result of the foregoing  gross profit decreased to million in compared to million in the gross profit margin was in compared to in selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of sales  in compared to million  or of sales  in this increase was partially due to increased selling costs of new products  wage increases  and increased professional fees due to the on going department of justice investigation of the staple fiber industry 
during the second quarter of  we implemented an overall cost reduction and productivity improvement plan  which was completed in the fourth quarter of in  we recognized restructuring income of million million after tax  or per diluted share  from over accruals related to this plan 
as a result of the foregoing  we reported operating income of million in compared to million in net interest expense was million in both and our effective tax rate for on income from continuing operations was compared to in the principal items which affected our rate were foreign earnings  which are taxed at rates lower than us rates  and amortization of nondeductible goodwill 
the net effect of these two items was a reduction in the tax rate 
as a result of the foregoing  net earnings from continuing operations were million  or per diluted share  for the period compared to million  or per diluted share  for we reported a net loss from discontinued operations of million  or per diluted share  and million  or per diluted share  for and  respectively 
we adopted a plan in march to sell our poy business and our small recycled fine denier polyester staple fiber business  the assets of which were previously reported as part of our frpg

in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we restated all prior years information 
for additional information  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discontinued operations and note to the consolidated financial statements 
as a result of the foregoing  we reported net earnings of million  or per diluted share  for  compared to net earnings of million  or per diluted share  for outlook the following statements are forward looking statements and should be read in conjunction with forward looking statements  risks and uncertainties below 
we expect to be more profitable than due to expected increases in pet resin volumes and margins 
we expect domestic pet resins capacity utilization to increase in future years because pet resins demand is expected to grow faster than announced capacity increases 
we expect demand for pet resins to grow in traditional pet packaging markets  as well as in new markets and products 
these new products include food products like spaghetti sauce  vegetables  and jellies that require higher filling temperatures 
in addition  resin customers have indicated they expect to use more of our recycled content resin 
increased capacity utilization is expected to result in increased margins in the industry 
we successfully implemented two significant selling price increases in our domestic pet resins business on january  and march  and have announced an additional selling price increase of per pound effective april  these increases are primarily to offset sharply higher chemical raw material costs 
while we anticipate increasing pet resin margins in  given the competitive nature of our business and other market influences  there can be no assurance that this will occur 
we expect the poor economic conditions in the domestic fibers market to continue as imports throughout the textile chain  especially from china  continue to adversely impact this market 
we successfully implemented a significant selling price increase in our domestic fibers business on march  and have announced additional selling price increases of to effective april  these increases are expected to offset sharply higher chemical raw material costs 
however  there can be no assurance that we will maintain our raw material margins 
to compete with imports of textile products  our fibers group continues to introduce differentiated high value added products 
we expect these products to have a small positive impact on raw material margins in in  we expect to sell approximately billion pounds of pet resins and million pounds of polyester staple fibers 
we intend to continue to focus on cost reductions and expect that these reductions will more than offset operating cost increases 
we anticipate our depreciation and amortization to be between million and capital expenditures to be between million 
in june  we announced the delay in the conversion of a polyester staple fiber line at our pearl river facility to a swing line 
this line would allow the production of either polyester staple fiber or pet resin 
while we do not plan to start this project in  we expect to announce the timetable for construction by the end of in january  moody s investors service lowered our credit rating to ba with a stable outlook 
as a result  we are currently rated below investment grade by both moody s and standard poor s 
in february  we signed a securities purchase agreement that will permit the issuance and sale of up to million of preferred stock and warrants to warburg pincus viii if certain conditions are met  including shareholder approval of the proposal and our entering into a new year million senior revolving credit facility that retires our existing million senior revolving credit facility 
we expect the change in our credit rating to increase our financing costs  which would be offset by the expected reduction in interest expense as a result of lower debt if the equity investment is consummated 
in february  after the announcement of the private equity investment  standard poor s improved our rating from baa with a negative outlook to baa with a stable outlook 
capital resources and liquidity net cash provided by operations  including both continuing and discontinued operations  was million  for compared to million for cash from operations in included a million tax refund  approximately million from decreases in working capital exclusive of the current portion of long term debt  and million received under the continued dumping and subsidy offset act of net cash used in investing activities amounted to million in compared to million in capital expenditures were million in compared to million in for information about expected capital expenditures in  see outlook above 
net cash used in financing activities principally related to debt repayments amounted to million in compared to million in this resulted from lower capital expenditures and improved cash flow from operations in the following table describes our debt facilities  providing details as to the maturity of these facilities and amounts outstanding at december   as well as available funding from both committed and uncommitted facilities 
table i december  in millions maturity total facility commitment amount outstanding amounts available under all facilities amounts available under committed facilities uncommitted lines of credit n a n a prudential note feb revolving bank facility sept metropolitan note nov hancock note dec hancock note sept industrial revenue bonds financial instruments and other n a n a total we have uncommitted lines of credit from banks 
generally these lines of credit can be terminated at any time as long as we have not borrowed against them 
we use these lines to borrow at competitive rates on a short term basis 
we borrowed million from prudential insurance company in february at an interest rate of as senior unsecured indebtedness with a single principal payment due in february this debt was repaid on its maturity date 
in conjunction with this financing  we entered into interest rate swaps  which effectively converted the total amount of this fixed rate debt to floating rate debt 
these swaps were terminated during  resulting in a gain of million 
this gain  million at december   is included in financial instruments and other in table and is being recognized as a reduction in interest expense over the remaining life of the debt 
we initially entered into a year million unsecured revolving credit agreement in september in april  we voluntarily reduced the commitment to million 
amounts are borrowed under this facility at floating rates and normally have maturities of six months or less 
this facility matures in september management expects to enter into a new facility during the first half of we borrowed million from metropolitan life insurance company in november as senior unsecured indebtedness at a floating interest rate based on libor  payable quarterly  with a single principal payment due in november we borrowed million from john hancock life insurance company in december as senior unsecured indebtedness at an interest rate of  payable semi annually  with a single principal payment due in december in conjunction with this financing  we entered into interest rate swaps  which effectively convert the total amount of this fixed rate debt to floating rate debt 
see below for more information on our derivative financial instruments 
we borrowed million from john hancock life insurance company in september as senior unsecured indebtedness at an annual fixed rate of  payable semi annually  with a single principal payment due in september we issued million of industrial revenue bonds in the s 
these are senior unsecured bonds 
we intend to redeem million of the industrial revenue bonds in march  in conjunction with the sale of our marion facility 
the remaining bonds mature on various dates beginning in these bonds bear interest at a floating rate and are supported by letters of credit that may be terminated upon months notice 
if a letter of credit is terminated  we would have to replace it  arrange for other security  or redeem the bonds 
we have various financial instruments described below  in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk and in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the financial instruments have a net value at december  of approximately million that is accounted for as a reduction of our debt obligations 
in addition to our debt commitments  we have entered into other commitments and contractual obligations that obligate us to make specified payments in the future 
the following table summarizes the total amounts due as of december  under all debt agreements see the amounts outstanding in the table above  commitments and other contractual obligations 
the table indicates the years in which payments are due under the contractual obligations 
this table includes commitments and other contractual obligations  including those with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships variable interest entities 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities that establishes new criteria for determining if variable interest entities should be consolidated 
for additional information  including the impact on our consolidated financial statements  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations impa ct of recently issued accounting pronouncements 
historically  we have been able to pay  renew or refinance these contractual obligations in advance of their termination dates and expect to maintain this ability for the foreseeable future 
see forward looking statements  risk and uncertainties 
table ii payments due by period in millions contractual obligations total after debt agreements see table i receivables securitization operating leases including sale and leaseback raw material purchase obligations total we replaced our existing receivables purchase agreement in september under the new agreement  we may continue to sell without recourse up to million in an undivided interest in certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable at a discount  on a revolving basis  through an unconsolidated receivables subsidiary 
this type of funding permits us to obtain funds at a rate lower than the borrowing rates available on our uncommitted lines or our revolving credit agreement 
the program was structured as a three year facility  however  the program must be renewed annually 
although we expect to renew the program  if it is not renewed or replaced  we would not be able to sell our receivables in this manner and our receivables and debt as reflected on our consolidated financial statements would each increase by the amount of the receivables that would otherwise have been sold at that time 
the resin assets at our palmetto facility were sold in june in a sale and leaseback transaction 
the equipment was purchased from us for its fair market value as verified by an independent appraisal of million 
under the year operating lease we entered into for this equipment  our rental payments as the lease is currently structured are expected to be approximately million per annum for the remainder of the lease  which is lower than the financing cost we otherwise would have incurred if we had borrowed the fair market value of the equipment at the time of the transaction 
in addition to this transaction  we have normal operating leases with aggregate rental payments approximating million in and varying amounts thereafter 
we have entered into several contracts for varying terms of up to ten years to purchase raw materials 
one raw material contract requires us to make unconditional minimum annual payments of million per year through december the supplier used our contract to obtain financing that expires in march if the financing cannot be replaced  then in order for us to preserve our favorable raw material pricing under this contract we would pay the present value of the remaining minimum payments million as of march 
any such accelerated payments would reduce our payments during the remaining term of the contract 
we anticipate that we will have sufficient liquidity  if necessary  to make this payment  including availability under our revolving credit facility 
this contract represents less than one third of our annual raw material purchases 
except for certain of the contractual obligations discussed above  we did not have any material relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  often referred to as special purpose entities  for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements with contractually narrow or limited purposes 
many of the contractual obligations in table ii contain provisions that change the costs of the obligations eg  interest rates based on our credit ratings 
as of january  we were rated as non investment grade by both rating agencies 
we are currently rated bb with a stable outlook by standard and poor s s p and ba with a stable outlook by moody s investors service moody s 
as a result of moody s changes to our rating in january  we expect our interest costs under these contractual obligations to increase by approximately million in compared to substantially all of the contractual obligations in table ii contain normal financial and restrictive covenants 
the principal financial covenants require that we maintain a debt to capital ratio of less than and a ratio of ebitda earnings before charges for interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization from continuing operations to our net interest expense both for the previous four quarters of greater than to at december   our debt to capital ratio was and our ratio of ebitda to net interest was these obligations also contain covenants that prohibit liens except in certain situations 
certain subsidiaries have guaranteed substantially all of our indebtedness for borrowed money 
these obligations also contain cross acceleration and cross payment default provisions for amounts greater than million 
at december   we were in compliance with the covenants and expect to remain in compliance for the foreseeable future 
see note to the consolidated financi al statements 
however  if current business conditions deteriorate or certain events occur including those set forth in forward looking statements  risks and uncertainties below  we may breach these covenants  in which case substantially all of these contractual obligations would immediately become due and payable 
if this occurred  there is no certainty these obligations could be refinanced 
if these obligations were refinanced under those circumstances  there is a high probability that we would incur increased costs and some or all of the contractual obligations would be classified as debt on our balance sheet 
the financial resources available to us at december  included million under our revolving credit facility and unused short term uncommitted lines of credit  and internally generated funds 
based on our debt level as of december   we could have had an average of approximately million of additional debt outstanding during the year without amending the terms of our debt agreements 
our current financing sources are primarily dependent on the bank and commercial paper markets since these are the lowest cost funds available 
the availability and cost of these funds can change in a short period of time for a variety of reasons 
as a result  we cannot be sure that low cost financing will continue to be available to us 
however  we believe our financial resources will be sufficient to meet our foreseeable needs for working capital  capital expenditures and dividends 
in addition  we have entered into an agreement to sell up to million of perpetual convertible preferred sto ck to warburg pincus viii 
for additional information  see item recent developments private equity investment 
environmental matters our operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations governing air emissions  wastewater discharges and solid and hazardous waste management activities 
we take a proactive approach in addressing the applicability of these laws and regulations as they relate to our manufacturing operations and in proposing and implementing any remedial plans that may be necessary 
we have identified certain situations that will require future capital and non capital expenditures to maintain or improve compliance with current environmental laws and regulations 
the majority of the identified situations are found at our largest manufacturing facilities and primarily deal with groundwater remediation  quality of air emissions and wastewater treatment processes 
our policy is to expense environmental remediation costs when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
while it is often difficult to reasonably quantify future environmental related expenditures  we currently estimate our future non capital expenditures related to environmental matters to range between million and million 
in connection with these expenditures  we have accrued undiscounted liabilities of approximately million and million at december  and  respectively  which are reflected as other noncurrent liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
these accruals represent our best estimate of probable non capital environmental expenditures 
in addition  aggregate future capital expenditures related to environmental matters are expected to range from million to million 
these non capital and capital expenditures are expected to be incurred during the next to years 
we believe that we ar e entitled to recover a portion of these expenditures under indemnification and escrow agreements 
during  and  net expenses associated with environmental remediation and ongoing assessment were not significant 
for additional information  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
we base the measurement of liability on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual situation and take into consideration factors such as existing technology  presently enacted laws and regulations and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites 
as assessments and remediation progress at individual sites  we review these liabilities periodically and adjust them to reflect additional technical and legal information that becomes available 
we believe we are either in material compliance with all currently applicable regulations or are operating in accordance with the appropriate variances and compliance schedules or similar arrangements 
in february  we received a notice from the south carolina department of health and environmental controls of violations regarding air emissions and related record keeping for our palmetto and johnsonville  sc facilities 
no further action  other than a minor fine  is expected 
subject to the imprecision in estimating future environmental costs  we believe that compliance with current laws and regulations will not require significant capital expenditures or have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations

in addition to those described above  the more prominent risks and uncertainties inherent in our business are set forth below 
however  this section does not discuss all possible risks and uncertainties to which we are subject  nor can it be assumed necessarily that there are no other risks and uncertainties which may be more significant to us 
economic conditions affect the supply and demand of our products 
capacity utilization  which is the demand for product divided by its supply  is a critical factor affecting our financial performance 
demand for polyester fiber historically has been cyclical because it is subject to changes in consumer preferences and spending  retail sales patterns  and fiber or textile product imports 
demand  prices and raw material costs for both pet resins and fiber may be affected by global economic conditions 
worldwide supply is expanding for both resins and fiber 
any significant expansion in supply over demand could reduce our profitability 
a material change in demand  supply or in general economic conditions or uncertainties regarding future economic prospects could have a material adverse effect on our profitability 
the financial condition of our customers impacts our profitability 
our customers include the manufacturers of plastic containers and textile mills  yarn spinners  and the injection molding industry 
the ppg has six customers that represented approximately of the ppg s total net sales in the frpg does not have any single customer that has a material effect on the segment 
if our customers have financial difficulties  this could affect our profitability by decreasing our sales and or resulting in the uncollectibility of accounts receivable 
fiber and textile imports continue to adversely impact our margins 
the us and european fiber and textile markets continue to be severely impacted by imports  principally from asian countries 
imports of fiber and fiber products continue to cause an over supply which decreases fiber margins 
the price and volume of imports have and are expected to continue to significantly impact the profitability of our businesses 
our operations are dependent on the availability and cost of our raw materials 
our operations are substantially dependent on the availability and cost of our two primary raw materials  pta and meg 
we currently rely on a single producer for our domestic supply of pta and a limited number of sources for meg 
the effect of the loss of any producer  a disruption in their businesses or a failure to meet our product needs on a timely basis would depend primarily upon the length of time necessary to find a suitable alternative source 
at a minimum  temporary shortages in needed raw materials could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we cannot be sure that the precautions we have taken would be adequate or that an alternative source of supply could be located or developed in a timely manner 
the prices of pta and meg  purchased pursuant to long term contracts  have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future 
recycled raw materials are purchased from many different suppliers  including some under long term supply contracts 
the prices of recycled raw materials are variable and determined by worldwide supply and demand 
the governmental investigation of pricing practices in the polyester stable fiber industry could adversely impact our profitability 
in january  we received a document subpoena in connection with a federal grand jury investigation of pricing practices in the polyester staple industry 
we have cooperated and continue to cooperate with the investigation by producing documents in response to this subpoena 
in september the us department of justice announced the indictment of a former sales manager of one of our competitors for conspiring to fix prices and allocate customers for polyester staple beginning in september and ending in january on october   the us department or justice announced that it was filing informations against another competitor and one of its former officers as a result of their agreement to plead guilty to participating in a conspiracy to fix prices and allocate customers in the polyester staple industry 
neither we nor any of our employees have been charged with any wrongdoing  and we vehemently deny that we or any of our employees have engaged in price fixing or c ustomer allocation 
following the disclosure of the investigation  the indictment of a competitor s employee  the informations and guilty pleas of another competitor and its employee  the producers of polyester fiber  including wellman  have been named in various civil actions asserting claims substantially based on the indictment and informations 
these proceedings are summarized below 
wellman and certain other companies have been named as defendants in nineteen federal actions brought by direct purchasers of polyester staple fiber for alleged violation of us antitrust laws 
in each lawsuit  the plaintiffs allege that the defendants engaged in a conspiracy to fix the price of polyester staple fiber in violation of the sherman act 
in seventeen of the cases  the plaintiff purports to represent a class of all persons who directly purchased polyester staple fiber and were similarly affected by such alleged conduct 
two of the cases are brought by plaintiffs who do not purport to represent a class 
all of the federal plaintiffs seek damages of unspecified amounts  attorney s fees and costs and unspecified relief 
in addition  certain of the actions claim restitution  injunction against alleged illegal conduct and other equitable relief 
the federal suits are pending in the us district court for the northern district of california  us district court for the district of new jersey  us district court for the middle district of north carolina  us district court for the western district of north carolina and us district court for the district of south carolina 
currently there are motions pending before the judicial panel on multi district litigation to transfer all the federal cases to a single federal court for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings 
in addition to the direct purchaser actions discussed above  thirty three purported class actions alleging violations of federal antitrust laws  state antitrust or unfair competition laws and certain state consumer protection acts have been filed in one federal court and various state courts on behalf of purported classes of indirect purchasers of polyester staple fiber products 
in each lawsuit  the plaintiffs allege that the defendants engaged in a conspiracy to fix prices of polyester staple fiber products 
in most of these cases  the plaintiffs seek damages of unspecified amounts  attorney s fees and costs and unspecified relief 
in addition  certain of the actions claim restitution  injunction against alleged illegal conduct and other equitable relief 
one indirect purchaser case is pending in the us district court for the western district of north carolina and is subject to transfer by the judicial panel on multi district litigation for coordination or consolidation with the ot her federal cases 
the rest of the indirect purchaser cases were filed in arizona  california  the district of columbia  florida  kansas  massachusetts  michigan  new mexico  north carolina  south dakota  tennessee  west virginia and wisconsin 
the cases filed in west virginia and wisconsin have been removed to federal court 
a motion to remand is pending in wisconsin 
if not remanded  these cases will also be transferred by the judicial panel on multi district litigation for coordination or consolidation with the other federal cases 
recently  wellman and certain other companies were named in an action filed in the superior court of justice for ontario  canada  by a plaintiff purporting to represent a class of direct and indirect purchasers of polyester staple fiber 
this complaint asserts claims under canadian law 
in addition to the foregoing  wellman may become subject to additional proceedings and lawsuits under federal and state antitrust and unfair competition laws 
furthermore  the federal grand jury investigation is ongoing and additional indictments may result 
we intend to vigorously defend against the civil claims and any civil or criminal claims or proceedings that may be brought against us in the future 
if a material adverse judgment occurs  our business  financial condition  profitability and cash flows may be adversely impacted 
the availability and costs of our financing could adversely affect our profitability 
certain events could reduce our access to financing and or increase our financing costs 
we are dependent on the banks and commercial paper markets for our financing 
these markets are volatile and the availability of financing and interest rates fluctuate based on conditions in the markets and lenders perception of our business 
the bank markets can be influenced by the economy  by the general credit environment  by the credit environment of our industry  and by the performance of the individual financial institution 
the commercial paper markets can be influenced by other financial markets 
in addition  our ability to borrow at competitive costs is influenced by our public debt ratings 
significant disruptions in these markets or lowering of our credit ratings could reduce our access to funds and or increase our cost of funds 
in addition  if current business conditions deteriorated or other events occurred that resulted in a breach of our covenants under our debt and certain other contractual obligations  all amounts due under these obligations would immediately become due and payable 
if this occurred  there is no certainty these obligations could be refinanced and  if they were  we would probably incur increased costs and some or all of the obligations would be classified as debt on our balance sheet

changes in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our profitability 
a large portion of our profitability is earned in entities where the functional currency is not the us dollar 
when these currencies weaken against the dollar  our profitability and the value of our investment in the foreign subsidiary decreases 
in addition  our foreign subsidiaries conduct business in currencies other than their functional currency 
changes in the relative strength of these currencies can adversely affect the profitability of the foreign subsidiaries in their functional currency 
a portion of the net assets of these subsidiaries is denominated in other than their functional currency 
while we reduce our foreign currency exposure by using appropriate hedges  our foreign subsidiaries still have net assets denominated in currencies other than their functional currency and may experience foreign exchange losses 
as a result  a material change in foreign currency exchange rates could affect our profitability 
regulatory changes may affect the demand for our products 
some of the end uses of our products are subject to federal and or state regulations 
adverse changes in these regulations could affect the demand for our products and adversely affect our profitability 
additional liabilities may be proposed by tax authorities 
we have entered into global tax planning initiatives in the normal course of our business 
these initiatives are subject to normal review by tax authorities 
it is possible that additional liabilities may be proposed by tax authorities as a result of these reviews and that some of the reviews could be resolved unfavorably 
increases in energy costs could adversely affect our profitability 
increases in energy costs impact our profitability by increasing our raw materials costs and production costs 
the prices of substantially all of our raw materials are impacted by changes in petrochemical costs 
our facilities utilize natural gas as their primary energy source  although some have the ability to switch a portion of their consumption to fuel oil 
an increase in these costs could adversely affect our profitability 
actual costs for environmental matters may vary from the estimates 
actual costs and future estimated costs for identified environmental situations may change 
given the inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures due to unknown conditions  changing government regulations and legal standards regarding liability and evolving related technologies  we could have higher future environmental expenditures 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk derivative financial instruments we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
we use derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
for additional discussion of our use of such instruments  see notes   and to the consolidated financial statements 
interest rate risk because our obligations under our bank facilities  bid loans and uncommitted lines of credit bear interest at floating rates  our earnings and cash flows are affected by changes in prevailing interest rates 
a increase in market interest rates from those at december  and would reduce income before income taxes by approximately million and million  respectively  and reduce cash flow from operations by million and million  respectively 
our interest rate financial instruments at december  exactly match the terms of the million of fixed rate debt 
any potential decrease in the fair value of our interest rate financial instruments will be offset by changes in the value of our fixed rate debt 
foreign currency risk we use foreign currency debt and foreign currency purchase and sale contracts with terms of less than one year to hedge our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
these financial instruments are primarily used to hedge certain accounts receivable denominated in foreign currencies 
if foreign currency exchange rates at december  and adversely changed by  the fair value of these financial instruments outstanding at december  and would decline by approximately million and million  respectively 
however  such loss in fair value would be substantially offset by an increase in the fair value of our underlying exposure 
our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in any potential changes in any underlying hedged amount or changes in sales levels affected by changes in local currency prices
