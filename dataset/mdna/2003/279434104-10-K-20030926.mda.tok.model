inventories increased by million for fiscal year compared to fiscal year while cost of sales decreased million for fiscal year compared to fiscal year the increase in inventories from fiscal year versus fiscal year was primarily due to an increase in finished goods inventories as the company maintained inventory levels based on a projected fourth quarter forecast that was initially estimated to be consistent with previous fourth quarter quantities

the company s total capital expenditures were million  which included million for the acquisition of russell performance products  in fiscal year  million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year the company anticipates making capital expenditures of million in fiscal year primarily for additional capital equipment to increase the company s production capacity

any failure of the supplier to supply carburetors to the company would have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  since alternative sources for obtaining the types of automotive carburetors marketed by the company are not readily available 
the company s inability to obtain automotive carburetors from other manufacturers  the company s failure to sell automotive carburetors in excess of the minimum purchase requirement or the contractual limitations on the company s pricing of automotive carburetors could have a material adverse effect on the company

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company s exposure to interest rate changes is primarily related to its variable rate debt which may be outstanding from time to time under the company s revolving credit facility with bank of america  nt sa 
the company s revolving credit facility is an million line of credit with an interest rate based on the bank s prime rate currently 
it expires on february  because the interest rate on the revolving credit facility is variable  the company s cash flow may be affected by increases in the prime rate 
management does not  however  believe that any risk inherent in the variable rate nature of the loan is likely to have a material effect on the company 
as of fiscal year ended june  and as of september   the company s outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility was zero 
even if the company were to draw down on the line prior to its expiration and an unpredicted increase in the prime rate occurred  it would not be likely to have a material effect
