nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  licenses 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  exelon has year operating licenses from the nrc for each of its nuclear units 
generation applied to the nrc in july nbsp  for renewal of the peach bottom units and nbsp  licenses and has applied for the extension of the operating license for dresden units and and quad cities station in january nbsp  the operating license renewal process takes approximately four to five years from the commencement of the project at a site until completion of the nrc s review 
the nrc review process takes approximately two years from the docketing of an application 
each requested license extension is expected to be for nbsp  years beyond the current license expiration 
depreciation provisions are based on the estimated useful lives of the units  which assume the extension of these licenses for all of the nuclear generating stations 
the following table summarizes the current operating license expiration dates for generation s nuclear facilities in service

nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  generation is subject to the jurisdiction of the nrc with respect to its nuclear generating stations  including the licensing of operation of each station 
the nrc subjects nuclear generating stations to continuing review and regulation covering  among other things  operations  maintenance  emergency planning  security  environmental and radiological aspects of those stations 
the nrc may modify  suspend or revoke licenses and impose civil penalties for failure to comply with the atomic energy act  the regulations under such act or the terms of such licenses 
changes in regulations by the nrc may require a substantial increase in capital expenditures for nuclear generating facilities or increased operating costs of nuclear generating units 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  the nrc oversight process uses objective  timely and safety significant criteria in assessing performance 
it also takes into account improvements in the performance of the nuclear industry over the past twenty years 
nuclear plant performance is measured by a combination of objective performance indicators and by the nrc inspection program 
these are closely focused on those plant activities having the greatest impact on safety and overall risk 
in addition  the nrc conducts periodic reviews of the effectiveness of each operator s programs to identify and correct problems 
the inspection program is designed to verify the accuracy of performance indicator information and to assess performance based on safety cornerstones 
these include initiating events  mitigating systems  integrity of barriers to release of radioactivity  emergency preparedness  occupational and public radiation safety  and physical protection 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  the nrc evaluates licensee performance by analyzing two distinct inputs inspection findings resulting from the nrc inspection program and performance indicators reported by the licensees on a quarterly basis 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nrc reactor oversight results for the fourth quarter of indicate that the performance indicators for the exelon nuclear plants are all in the highest performance band  with the exception of one indicator for dresden unit  which is still considered to be acceptable performance within that indicator by the nrc 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  exelon does not fully know the impact that future terrorist attacks or threats of terrorism may have on its industry in general and on exelon in particular 
the events of september nbsp  have affected exelon s operating procedures and costs 
exelon has initiated security measures to safeguard its employees and critical operations and is actively participating in industry initiatives to identify methods to maintain the reliability of exelon s energy production and delivery systems 
generation has met or exceeded all security measures mandated by the nrc for nuclear plants after the september nbsp  terrorist attacks 
these security measures resulted in increased costs in of nbsp  million  of which approximately nbsp  million was capitalized 
on a continuing basis  exelon is evaluating enhanced security measures at certain critical locations  enhanced response and recovery plans and assessing long term design changes and redundancy measures 
additionally  the energy industry is working with governmental authorities to ensure that emergency plans are in place and critical infrastructure vulnerabilities are addressed in order to maintain the reliability of the country s energy systems 
these measures will involve additional expense to develop and implement  but will provide increased assurances as to exelon s ability to continue to operate under difficult times 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nuclear waste disposal 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  there are no facilities for the reprocessing or permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel snf currently in operation in the united states  nor has the nrc licensed any such facilities 
generation currently stores all snf generated by nuclear generation facilities in on site storage pools and  in the case of peach bottom and dresden  some snf has been placed in dry cask storage facilities 
not all of generation s snf storage pools have sufficient storage capacity for the life of the plant 
generation is developing dry cask storage facilities  as necessary to support operations 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  under the nuclear waste policy act of nwpa  the us department of energy doe is responsible for the selection and development of repositories for  and the disposal of  snf and high level radioactive waste 
as required by the nwpa  generation is a party to contracts with the doe standard contract to provide for disposal of snf from its nuclear generating stations 
in accordance with the nwpa and the standard contract  generation pays the doe one mill 
per kwh of net nuclear generation for the cost of nuclear fuel long term storage and disposal 
this fee may be adjusted prospectively in order to ensure full cost recovery 
the nwpa and the standard contract required the doe to begin taking possession of snf generated by nuclear generating units by no later than january nbsp  the doe  however  failed to meet that deadline and its performance will be delayed significantly 
the doe s current estimate for opening a snf permanent disposal facility is this extended delay in snf acceptance by the doe has led to generation s adoption of dry storage at its dresden  quad cities and peach bottom stations and its consideration of dry storage at other stations 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  in july nbsp  comed filed a complaint against the united states government government in the united states court of federal claims court seeking to recover damages caused by the doe s failure to honor its contractual obligation to begin disposing of snf in january nbsp  this litigation was assumed by generation in the corporate restructuring 
in august nbsp  the court granted generation s motion for partial summary judgment for liability on comed s breach of contract claim 
in november nbsp  the government filed two partial summary judgment motions relating to certain damage issues in the case  as well as two motions to dismiss claims other than the breach of contract claim 
on august nbsp   after taking discovery related to certain damages  generation filed briefs in response to the doe s motions 
the court has postponed the time for the doe to file reply briefs while it entertains additional doe discovery motions 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  in july nbsp  peco entered into an agreement with the doe relating to generation s peach bottom nuclear generating unit to address the doe s failure to begin removal of snf in january nbsp  as required by the standard contract amendment 
under that agreement  the doe agreed to provide peco with credits against peco s future contributions to the nuclear waste fund over the next ten years to compensate peco for snf storage costs incurred as a result of the doe s breach of the standard contract 
the agreement also provides that  upon peco s request  the doe will take title to the snf and the interim storage facility at peach bottom  provided certain conditions are met 
generation assumed this contract in corporate restructuring 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  in november nbsp  eight utilities with nuclear power plants filed a joint petition for review against the doe with the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit seeking to invalidate that portion of the agreement providing for credits to peco against nuclear waste fund payments on the ground that such provision is a violation of the nwpa 
peco intervened as a defendant in that case  and generation assumed the claim in the corporate restructuring 
on september nbsp   the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit ruled that the fee adjustment provision of the agreement violates the nwpa and therefore is null and void 
the court did not hold that the agreement as a whole is invalid 
the amendment provides that if any portion of the amendment is found to be void  the doe and generation agree to negotiate in good faith and attempt to reach an enforceable agreement consistent with the spirit and purpose of the amendment 
that provision further provides that should a major term be declared void  and the doe and generation cannot reach a subsequent agreement  the entire amendment would be rendered null and void  the original peach bottom standard contract would remain in effect and the parties would return to pre amendment status 
generation has begun negotiations with the doe and those negotiations are ongoing 
under the agreement  generation has received approximately nbsp  million in credits against contributions to the nuclear waste fund 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  in april nbsp  an individual filed suit against the doe with the united states district court for the middle district of pennsylvania seeking to invalidate the agreement on the grounds that the doe has violated the national environmental policy act and the administrative procedure act 
peco intervened as a defendant and moved to dismiss the complaint 
generation assumed the defense in corporate restructuring 
on september nbsp   the court granted generation s motion and dismissed the lawsuit on the ground that the court did not have jurisdiction over the matter 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  the standard contract with the doe also requires that peco and comed pay the doe a one time fee applicable to nuclear generation through april nbsp  peco s fee has been paid 
pursuant to the standard contract  comed elected to pay the one time fee of nbsp  million  with interest to the date of payment  just prior to the first delivery of snf to the doe 
as of december nbsp   the unfunded liability for the one time fee with interest was nbsp  million 
the liabilities for spent nuclear fuel disposal costs  including the one time fee  were transferred to generation as part of the corporate restructuring 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  as a by product of their operations  nuclear generation units produce low level radioactive waste llrw 
llrw is accumulated at each generation station and permanently disposed of at federally licensed disposal facilities 
the federal low level radioactive waste policy act of waste policy act provides that states may enter into agreements to provide regional disposal facilities for llrw and restrict use of those facilities to waste generated within the region 
illinois and kentucky have entered into an agreement  although neither state currently has an operational site and none is currently expected to be operational until after pennsylvania  which had agreed to be the host site for llrw disposal facilities for generators located in pennsylvania  delaware  maryland and west virginia  has suspended the search for a permanent disposal site 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  generation has temporary on site storage capacity at its nuclear generation stations for limited amounts of llrw and has been shipping such waste to llrw disposal facilities in south carolina and utah 
the number of llrw disposal facilities is decreasing  and generation anticipates the possibility of continuing difficulties in disposing of llrw 
generation is pursuing alternative disposal strategies for llrw  including a llrw reduction program to minimize cost impacts 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  the national energy policy act of requires that the owners of nuclear reactors pay for the decommissioning and decontamination of the doe uranium enrichment facilities 
the total cost to all domestic utilities covered by this requirement was originally nbsp  million per year through  of which generation s share was approximately nbsp  million per year 
payments are adjusted annually to reflect inflation 
including the effect of inflation  generation paid nbsp  million in nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  insurance 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  the price anderson act limits the liability of nuclear reactor owners for claims that could arise from a single incident 
as of january nbsp   the current limit is nbsp  billion and is subject to change to account for the effects of inflation and changes in the number of licensed reactors 
generation carries the maximum available commercial insurance of nbsp  million and the remaining nbsp  billion is provided through mandatory participation in a financial protection pool 
under the price anderson act  all nuclear reactor licensees can be assessed up to nbsp  million per reactor per incident  payable at no more than nbsp  million per reactor per incident per year 
this assessment is subject to inflation and state premium taxes 
in addition  the us congress could impose revenue raising measures on the nuclear industry to pay claims 
the price anderson act expired on august nbsp  but existing facilities  including those owned and operated by generation  remain covered 
the price anderson act provisions relating to commercial facilities were extended through the extension affects facilities obtaining nrc operating licenses in existing facilities are unaffected by the extension 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  generation carries property damage  decontamination and premature decommissioning insurance for each station loss resulting from damage to its nuclear plants 
in the event of an accident  insurance proceeds must first be used for reactor stabilization and site decontamination 
if the decision is made to decommission the facility  a portion of the insurance proceeds will be allocated to a fund  which generation is required by the nrc to maintain  to provide for decommissioning the facility 
generation is unable to predict the timing of the availability of insurance proceeds to generation and the amount of such proceeds that would be available 
under the terms of the various insurance agreements  generation could be assessed up to nbsp  million for losses incurred at any plant insured by the insurance companies 
in the event that one or more acts of terrorism cause accidental property damage within a twelve month period from the first accidental property damage under one or more policies for all insureds  the maximum recovery for all losses by all insureds will be an aggregate of nbsp  billion plus such additional amounts as the insurer may recover for all such losses from reinsurance  indemnity  and any other source  applicable to such losses 
the nbsp  billion maximum recovery limit is not applicable  however  in the event of a certified act of terrorism as defined in the terrorism risk insurance act of  as a result of government indemnity 
generally  a certified act of terrorism is defined in the terrorism risk insurance act to be any act  certified by the us government  to be an act of terrorism committed on behalf of a foreign person or interest 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  additionally  generation is a member of an industry mutual insurance company  nuclear electric insurance limited neil  that provides replacement power cost insurance in the event of a major accidental outage at a nuclear station 
the premium for this coverage is subject to assessment for adverse loss experience 
generation s maximum share of any assessment is nbsp  million per year 
recovery under this insurance for terrorist acts is subject to the nbsp  billion aggregate limit and secondary to the property insurance described above 
this limit would also not apply in cases of certified acts of terrorism under the terrorism risk insurance act as described above 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  in addition  generation participates in the american nuclear insurers master worker program  which provides coverage for worker tort claims filed for bodily injury caused by a nuclear energy accident 
this program was modified  effective january nbsp   to provide coverage to all workers whose nuclear related employment began on or after the commencement date of reactor operations 
generation will not be liable for a retrospective assessment under this new policy 
however  in the event losses incurred under the small number of policies in the old program exceed accumulated reserves  a maximum retroactive assessment of up to nbsp  million could apply 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  generation does not carry any business interruption insurance for nuclear operations other than the neil coverage 
generation is self insured to the extent that any losses may exceed the amount of insurance maintained 
such losses could have a material adverse effect on generation s financial condition and results of operations 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  decommissioning 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nrc regulations require that licensees of nuclear generating facilities demonstrate reasonable assurance that funds will be available in certain minimum amounts at the end of the life of the facility to decommission the facility 
based on estimates of decommissioning costs for each of the nuclear facilities in which generation has an ownership interest  the icc permits comed  and the puc permits peco to collect from its customers and deposit in nuclear decommissioning trust funds maintained by generation amounts which  together with earnings thereon  will be used to decommission such nuclear facilities 
as of december nbsp   generation s estimate of its nuclear facilities decommissioning cost is nbsp  billion in current year dollars 
the liability for decommissioning each generation station is recognized ratably over that generating station s service life 
at december nbsp   the decommissioning liability recorded in accumulated depreciation and deferred credits and other liabilities was nbsp  billion and nbsp  billion  respectively 
decommissioning expenditures are expected to occur primarily after the plants are retired and are currently estimated to begin in for plants currently in operation 
decommissioning costs are currently recoverable by comed and peco through regulated rates and are remitted to generation for deposit in the decommissioning trust funds 
in  comed and peco remitted to generation approximately nbsp  million in decommissioning collections 
generation believes that the amounts being remitted to it by comed and peco and the earnings on nuclear decommissioning trust funds will be sufficient to fully fund generation s decommissioning obligations 
see the critical accounting estimates and new accounting pronouncements section within item nbsp  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  generation for a further discussion of nuclear decommissioning 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  in connection with the transfer of comed s nuclear generating stations to generation  comed asked the icc to approve the continued recovery of decommissioning costs after the transfer 
on december nbsp   the icc issued an order finding that the icc has the legal authority to permit comed to continue to recover decommissioning costs from customers for the six year term of the ppas between comed and generation 
under the icc order  comed is permitted to recover nbsp  million per year from customers for decommissioning for the years through in and  comed can recover up to nbsp  million annually  depending upon the portion of the output of the former comed nuclear stations that comed purchases from generation 
under the icc order  subsequent to  there will be no further recoveries of decommissioning costs from customers 
the icc order also provides that any surplus funds after the nuclear stations are decommissioned must be refunded to customers 
the icc order has been upheld on appeal in the illinois appellate court and the illinois supreme court has declined to review the appellate court s decision 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nuclear decommissioning costs associated with the nuclear generating stations formerly owned by peco continue to be recovered currently through rates charged by peco to regulated customers 
these amounts are remitted to generation as allowed by the puc 
under an agreement effective september nbsp  peco remits nbsp  million per year to generation related to nuclear decommissioning cost recovery 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  on december nbsp   peco filed with the puc for an annual increase in its decommissioning cost recovery of nbsp  million effective june nbsp  the filing is consistent with provisions in the settlement and the settlement agreement entered into by peco in related to the puc s approval of the merger  which require peco to update the cost of decommissioning every five years 
the additional amount requested is expected to be reduced as it does not reflect pending life extensions at peach bottom 
the approval of the life extensions is expected by mid nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  zion  a two unit nuclear generation station  and dresden unit formerly owned by comed  have permanently ceased power generation 
comed transferred zion and dresden unit  as well as their related decommissioning liabilities and trust funds  to generation as part of the corporate restructuring 
zion and dresden unit s snf is currently being stored in on site storage pools and dry cask storage  respectively  until a permanent repository under the nwpa is completed 
generation has recorded a liability of nbsp  billion  which represents the estimated cost of decommissioning zion and dresden unit in current year dollars 
decommissioning expenditures are expected to occur primarily after and for zion and dresden unit  respectively

nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  fossil generation plants are generally not licensed and  therefore  the decision on when to retire plants is  fundamentally  an economic one 
hydroelectric plants are licensed by ferc 
the muddy run and conowingo facilities have licenses that expire in september nbsp  generation is considering applying to ferc for license extensions of nbsp  years for both plants  but the duration of any license extension will depend on then current policies at ferc

federal power act nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  the federal power act gives ferc exclusive ratemaking jurisdiction over wholesale sales of electricity and the transmission of electricity in interstate commerce 
pursuant to the federal power act  all public utilities subject to ferc s jurisdiction are required to file rate schedules with ferc with respect to wholesale sales or transmission of electricity 
tariffs established under ferc regulation give generation access to transmission lines that enables it to participate in competitive wholesale markets 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  because generation sells power in the wholesale markets  generation is deemed to be a public utility for purposes of the federal power act and is required to obtain ferc s acceptance of the rate schedules for wholesale sales of electricity 
generation has received authorization from ferc to sell energy at market based rates 
as is customary with market based rate schedules  ferc reserved the right to suspend market based rate authority on a retroactive basis if it is subsequently determined that generation or any of its affiliates exercised or have the ability to exercise market power 
ferc is also authorized to order refunds if it finds that market based rates are unreasonable 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  in april nbsp  ferc issued order no 
nbsp  order 
the intent of order was to open the transmission grid subject to ferc s jurisdiction to all eligible customers  including sellers of power and retail customers  in states where retail access is approved 
order requires that owners of transmission facilities provide access to their transmission facilities under filed tariffs at cost based rates 
in connection with order  ferc issued order no 
nbsp  order 
under order  peco and comed were required to file standards of conduct  which governed the communication of non public information between transmission personnel and employees of any affiliated wholesale merchant function 
ferc recently issued a notice of proposed rulemaking for the standards of conduct for transmission providers 
among other things  ferc is considering whether it would be appropriate for it to adopt measures that would limit the amount of capacity an affiliate can hold in a transmission provider 
generation s business would be impacted if any of these measures were instituted 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  as described above under energy delivery  transmission services  in december nbsp  ferc issued order  to encourage the voluntary formation of rtos by december nbsp  that would provide transmission service across multiple transmission systems 
one of the intended benefits of establishing these entities is to eliminate or reduce transmission charges imposed by successive transmission systems when wholesale generators cross several transmission systems to deliver capacity 
however  inconsistencies in the pace of rto development and significant state public utility commission concerns caused ferc to indefinitely extend its operational target date of december nbsp  pjm has been approved as an rto  as has the midwest iso 
however  isos operating in other regions where generation owns facilities have not yet been fully approved as rtos 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  ferc has also proposed rulemakings to mandate a standard market design smd for the wholesale markets 
order and the proposed smd rule contemplate that the jurisdictional transmission owners in a region will turn over operating authority over their transmission facilities to an rto or other independent entity for the purpose of providing open transmission access 
as a result  the independent entity will become the provider of the transmission service and the transmission owners will recover their revenue requirements through the independent entity 
the transmission owners will remain responsible for maintaining and physically operating their transmission facilities 
the smd rulemaking proposal would also require rtos to operate an organized bid based wholesale market for those who wish to sell their generation through the market and to implement a financially based system for dealing with congestion on transmission lines known as locational marginal pricing lmp 
ferc has also issued proposals to encourage rto development  independent control of the transmission grid and expansion of the transmission grid by providing enhanced returns on equity for transmission assets 
ferc s smd proposal has met with substantial opposition from a number of parties  including some state regulators and other governmental officials 
as a result  ferc has delayed issuance of a final rule indefinitely while it seeks further comment 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  ferc order has not led to the rapid development of rtos and ferc has not yet finalized its smd proposal  due in part to the resistance noted above 
exelon supports both of these proposals but cannot predict whether they will be successful  what impact they may ultimately have on exelon s transmission rates  revenues and operation of its transmission facilities  or whether they will ultimately lead to the development of large  successful regional wholesale markets 
to the extent comed and peco have polr obligations  and may at some point no longer have long term supply contracts with generation for their load  the ability of comed and peco to cost effectively serve their polr load obligation will depend on the development of such markets 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  in late  ferc initiated an effort to standardize generator interconnection policies and procedures 
when ferc issues a final rule on this subject  it is expected that generators will benefit from not having to deal on a case by case basis with different and sometimes inconsistent requirements of different transmission providers 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  several other actions by ferc should be noted 
first  ferc announced in late november nbsp  a new market power test  the supply margin assessment sma screen 
under the sma  if within a particular geographic market an energy company s generation capacity exceeds the market s surplus capacity above peak demand then the test is failed 
where this occurs  ferc will impose on the company and its affiliates a requirement to offer uncommitted capacity under a cost based rate structure 
the only exemption will be for companies operating under the authority of an iso or rto with a ferc approved market monitoring and mitigation plan 
under this approach  it would be unlikely that a vertically integrated energy company serving franchised retail load would be able to pass the test and maintain market based rates  unless and until the company was a member of an approved iso or rto 
in december nbsp  ferc essentially suspended the applicability of this test  holding that no company would be required to undertake any mitigation until after ferc had held a technical conference on the subject 
this technical conference has not been scheduled 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  second  ferc continues to exhibit nbsp  a commitment to increased market monitoring with an intent to ensure that high price volatility  such as was seen in california  does not occur again 
as part of this commitment  ferc announced early in the formation of the office of market oversight and investigation  which will report directly to the ferc chairman 
this new office will assess  among other things  market performance 
it is unclear how generation s business may be impacted by these initiatives 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  currently  while a significant portion of generation s capacity is located within the pjm rto area  other significant generation is located within the mid american interconnected network main reliability region  and is not yet in an approved iso or rto 
when comed joins pjm  most of this capacity will be in an approved rto 
generation also owns capacity located within the service territory of illinois power company ip 
ip has entered into an agreement to sell its transmission system  and the proposed buyer has notified ferc that it intends to place that system under the control of midwest independent transmission system operator  inc  which is also an approved rto 
in the meantime  however  it is possible that under its evolving market power tests  ferc might determine that generation has market power in this area 
if ferc were to suspend generation s market based rate authority  it would most likely be necessary to file  and obtain ferc acceptance of  cost based rate schedules or schedules tied to a public index 
in addition  the loss of market based rate authority would subject generation to the accounting  record keeping and reporting requirements that are imposed on public utilities with cost based rate schedules 
fuel nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  the following table shows sources of electric supply in gigawatthours gwhs for and estimated for nbsp  nbsp  source of electric supply nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  est

including ppas with amergen 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  the fuel costs for nuclear generation are substantially less than fossil fuel generation 
consequently  nuclear generation is the most cost effective way for generation to meet its commitment to supply the requirements of comed  peco and certain requirements of enterprise s competitive retail energy sales business  exelon energy nbsp  inc exelon energy  and for sales to other utilities 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  the cycle of production and utilization of nuclear fuel includes the mining and milling of uranium ore into uranium concentrates  the conversion of uranium concentrates to uranium hexafluoride  the enrichment of the uranium hexafluoride and the fabrication of fuel assemblies 
generation has uranium concentrate inventory and supply contracts sufficient to meet all of its uranium concentrate requirements through generation s contracted conversion services are sufficient to meet all of its uranium conversion requirements through all of generation s enrichment requirements have been contracted through contracts for fuel fabrication have been obtained through generation does not anticipate difficulty in obtaining the necessary uranium concentrates or conversion  enrichment or fabrication services for its nuclear units 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  generation obtains approximately of its uranium enrichment services from european suppliers 
there is an ongoing trade action by usec  nbsp  inc usec alleging dumping in the united states against european enrichment services suppliers 
in january nbsp  the us international trade commission determined that usec was materially injured or threatened with material injury by low enriched uranium exported by european suppliers 
the us department of commerce doc has assessed countervailing and anti dumping duties against the european suppliers 
both usec and the european suppliers have appealed these decisions 
generation is uncertain at this time as to the outcome of the pending appeals  however as a result of these actions generation may incur higher costs for uranium enrichment services necessary for the production of nuclear fuel

nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  coal is obtained for coal fired plants primarily through annual contracts with the remainder supplied through either short term contracts or spot market purchases 
nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  substantially all of the natural gas requirements for generation s mystic and mystic units  currently under construction  will be supplied through a twenty year natural gas contract that became effective on december nbsp  with distrigas of massachusetts  llc distrigas 
the distrigas facilities consist of a lng import terminal located adjacent to the mystic station 
generation is anticipating an additional pipeline gas supply arrangement to supplement lng supplies to be in service by early nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  nbsp  natural gas requirements for operating stations and other stations under construction will be procured through annual  monthly and spot market purchases 
some fossil generation stations can use either oil or gas as fuel 
fuel oil inventories are managed such that in the winter months sufficient volumes of fuel are available in the event of extreme weather conditions and during the remaining months inventory levels are managed to take advantage of favorable market pricing 
generation uses financial instruments to mitigate price risk associated with multi commodity price exposures 
generation also hedges forward price risk with both over the counter and exchange traded instruments
